"As COVID Surges, Chinese Turn to Black Market for Antiviral Drugs","Scalpers are reportedly selling Paxlovid for as much as $7,000 per box.",2022-12-28,"The lack of availability of a crucial COVID-19 drug has fostered a black market in China, as the country battles its worst coronavirus outbreak following the abrupt relaxation of stringent virus control measures earlier this month. With a severe shortage of approved antivirals such as Paxlovid, which is manufactured by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Chinese residents have resorted to underground channels to source the drug and various generic medicines, domestic media reported. Scalpers have reportedly been charging as much as 50,000 yuan ($7,170) for a box of Paxlovid — over 20 times its original price of 2,300 yuan — that would be enough for one course of treatment, while generic versions of the medicine sell for around 1,800 yuan. China approved the use of Paxlovid in February for treating adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high risk of progressing to a severe condition. It remains the only legally imported medicine for treating the disease, though other generic ones under the brands of Primovir, Paxista, Molnunat, and Molnatris prevail on the black market given Paxlovid’s limited supply and expensive price. Shanghai resident Sun Jianwei told Sixth Tone that he was considering asking his Hong Kong-based friend to buy a generic version of the drug, which is made in India. He said he had failed to purchase Paxlovid through legal channels. “I want to buy some in case my parents get infected,” he said. As COVID explodes in China, the country is struggling to ensure an ample supply of common medicines used to treat colds and fevers, though authorities have urged pharmacies to sell medicines in smaller packages so more patients can get them. Amid the grim situation, some people, including activist artist Nut Brother, are crowdsourcing medicines for vulnerable rural residents, while tech giant Tencent has developed a mini-app where people can offer and receive extra drugs or other health equipment. Online, many social media users have criticized the scalpers for pushing up drug prices at such a critical time. A related hashtag translating to “scalpers selling Pfizer’s COVID medicine for 50,000 yuan” had been viewed 5.8 million times as of Wednesday afternoon. “This scalper is selling Paxlovid for 19,000 yuan and has the guts to describe himself as a saint. May God punish those making a fortune from a national crisis,” one user with the name Yvonne commented on a Weibo post, which has screenshots of a scalper providing details about the medicine he has been selling. Meanwhile, doctors have warned against rushing out to buy antivirals, which they say should only be taken under medical supervision to prevent potential side effects. “Healthy young people with a good immune system can recover from current Omicron infections on their own,” Sha Kefu, a Beijing-based doctor, told Sixth Tone. “It’s not necessary for everyone to use Paxlovid — we only prescribe it to those who are seriously ill with obvious lung infections.” Apart from the drug shortage, China’s healthcare system has been overstretched amid surging outbreaks across the country. Data from the National Health Commission showed that the country had 181,000 ICU beds as of December 25, or 12.8 beds for every 100,000 people, compared with higher-income countries like the United States and Germany which have 34.7 and 29.2 ICU beds, respectively, per 100,000 people.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011990
China’s Inbound Travelers Confused Over Quarantine as COVID Spreads Unchecked,"Many returnees say they’re unsure about going home after being released, as many family members have COVID.",2022-12-23,"Isabella Tang paid a hefty sum to return home for the holidays. She spent around $6,000 in total for air tickets between Los Angeles and Guangzhou, PCR tests, and eight days of quarantine. Tang said she had no qualms about it, considering she was visiting her parents, both in their late 40s, and protecting them from COVID potentially being passed on. But as the coronavirus spread through China since the country dismantled most of its virus control policies earlier this month, her parents tested positive for the virus just a day before she was to leave her quarantine Wednesday. “I’m now confused,” Tang, a student at a U.S. university, told Sixth Tone. “What’s the point of quarantine and PCR tests if we’re going back to a family full of positive cases? I’ve been in the United States for the past nine months and haven’t gotten infected despite a higher caseload. Now this?” Changsha, home to about eight million residents, like other cities in China, is experiencing a surge in infections unlike anytime before. The sudden relaxation of some rules, including mass testing and lockdowns, without much preparation has brought life to a standstill in many places — it’s overstretching logistics, straining hospitals, and there’s not even a sufficient supply of fever and cold medicines. Though pandemic controls have loosened, China still requires travelers from overseas to do a pre-boarding PCR test and quarantine for five days at a government-designated facility, as well as three more days of at-home isolation. On Thursday, news outlet Bloomberg reported that the country was planning to scrap quarantine for international arrivals starting January, though there has been no official confirmation. Social media posts suggest that the southwestern city of Chengdu was already implementing its own rules for inbound travelers, with several users on Xiaohongshu saying that they only had to undergo a two-day hotel quarantine and three days of home isolation. The government hasn’t formally announced the rule, and a member of staff at Chengdu’s Shuangliu International Airport told Sixth Tone on Friday that they were still implementing measures from the official playbook. On Xiaohongshu, hundreds of people who had just landed in China and were in quarantine seemed confused about their plans after being released. Many said their family members had already tested positive for the coronavirus. “Where should I go after quarantine?” asked many, becoming one of the most pressing questions on the platform. As for Tang, she said she’s not too concerned anymore. She’s home with her parents and hasn’t developed any symptoms or gotten tested. “I don’t care if I get infected or not to be honest. My PCR test result won’t affect reentering the U.S.,” said Tang. “I just felt the whole situation was hilarious. The fact that I can so easily treat this as a dark comedy and make fun of it is terrifying.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011970
Staying Negative: New Covid Policies Bring Memes Aplenty,"The Chinese internet has exploded with people sharing their positive COVID-19 tests, and joking about what to do next.",2022-12-23,"Since China pivoted away from its “dynamic zero-COVID” policies, the current Omicron variant has caused a surge of infections. As many cities, including the capital Beijing, are in the midst of a spike in cases, netizens (some already sick at home) have also generated reams of new slang terms, hoping to console their infected friends and cheer up the lucky ones who remain healthy. During China’s zero-COVID era, a crucial life-saving strategy for citizens was “storing vegetables” (tuncai) in case of unexpected lockdown. However, as infection now seems inevitable, residents immediately shifted gear... but not by much. “Before: We store vegetables and wait for lockdowns. Now: We stockpile medicine and wait for fever.” Overnight, Beijing saw long lines spring up outside pharmacies. Anxious residents rushed to drugstores or shopped online to store medicine and antigen test kits. Cold and fever medicines were soon out of stock, and countless reports started mushrooming around the city of people who tested positive, known as “little positive people” (xiaoyang ren) or “sheep” (yang), since the word for “sheep” sounds the same as “positive.” Netizens quipped online: “There have been a large number of COVID infections in Beijing. If you don’t know any positive patients, please reflect on your social skills.” They also created plenty of jokes related to the test result: Terms for “negative” and “positive” are based on the traditional Chinese philosophical concept of yin and yang. People’s WeChat social feeds were soon full of COVID patients posting their antigen test results, symptoms, and feelings. Netizens awed: “My WeChat Moments is full of yang energy.” They even joked: “What is the first symptom when people get COVID? For 99% of them it would be sharing it on WeChat Moments.”  Beijing residents’ daily greeting has also changed from “Have you eaten?” to “Have you done your Covid test?” and now it became: “Have you tested positive?”If somebody asks them: “How is Beijing’s pandemic situation?” They might answer: “Very well, we are nearly approaching zero-negative.” It was reassuring to see residents keep an optimistic attitude amid fever and freezing weather. They announced on the internet: “Today, the lowest temperature in Beijing is minus 7 degrees Celsius, but the average temperature of Beijingers is 38.8 degrees Celsius. Welcome to hot-blooded Beijing.”  Some companies started to isolate positive workers. Netizens made fun of the practice by playing on the words yinjian and yangjian, which normally refer to the underworld and the mortal world: “In my office, workers are separated. One side is the underworld (for negative people), and the other is the upper world (for positive cases).” This time, however, the “underworld” is where you want to be.Several innocent celebrities and fictional characters also regained heated discussion recently, simply because the pronunciation of their names was relevant to yang. Yang Di, a host and actor, found himself becoming an online meme. His name is pronounced the same as a term literally meaning “the enemy of being positive.” Yang’s picture thus was reposted in almost every corner of the internet, and even pasted on people’s office desks, with the caption, “Repost this Yang Di, and you can always stay negative.”  Yang Guo, the fictional protagonist of the renowned wuxia novel “The Return of the Condor Heroes” by Jin Yong (whose real name was Zha Liangyong), has gained popularity again lately, since his name is a homophone for yangguo, meaning someone who has already tested positive (and presumably will soon recover). As Yang Guo was honored as Condor Hero in the novel, netizens joked: “In a few days, Beijing will be full of Condor Heroes on the street.” A WeChat game called “Sheep a Sheep,” “Yang Le Ge Yang” in Chinese, which went viral two months ago, is also now embedded with a new meaning. The game is full of tiles drawn with sheep, and players must eliminate tiles of the same category in groups of three to win and join a virtual herd. As yang acquaintances spring up around them, negative people start to wonder: “When am I able to join the herd?” Some, tired of the waiting game, even wish they can get infected soon: “It feels like everyone has taken an exam, but I am still reviewing for it. Some say it is difficult, and some say easy. The more I prepare, the more nervous I get. I don’t know when I will be called to take the exam.” The remaining negative Beijing residents now keep asking themselves three daily questions: “When will I be positive? Will I feel sick when I get positive? Have I already been positive (and asymptomatic)?” They sigh online: “The atmosphere has been hyped up so much, it would be impolite to stay negative at this point.” Writer: Zhang Wenjie.

Shanghai Races to Vaccinate Older Residents as COVID Runs Wild,A district has started its fourth booster dose drive and is also deploying mobile vaccination camps for the elderly.,2022-12-21,"SHANGHAI — Two days after Shanghai’s Jinshan District rolled out its second booster dose against COVID-19 for high-risk and older residents, volunteers set up a mobile vaccination center on Wednesday, as residents rolled up their sleeves to guard them against the coronavirus that is running wild nationwide. Masked up and wrapped up in their cozy winter clothes, many of the elderly from the district’s Zhongmin Village walked to the vaccination center, as volunteers explained to them the benefits of the vaccine. Xu Yafang, 64, was among them. “I’m afraid (of the virus) so I came here for the vaccination,” she told Sixth Tone after getting the shot. “I exercise for an hour every morning and always keep my mask on when outside.” Wednesday’s initiative in Shanghai is part of the central government’s push — which had been lagging — to vaccinate and boost the elderly after the country suddenly eased most of its virus control policy earlier this month. Volunteers are either setting mobile vaccination camps or going from door to door to those with mobility and other health issues. The country’s top health officials have said that people over the age of 60 were at a greater risk of severe illness from COVID, with those in the over-80 demographic facing even more complications. China is home to an estimated 260 million people over the age of 60, who are more vulnerable to the coronavirus. As of November, some 25 million people over the age of 60 hadn’t been vaccinated against COVID and only about 40% of those over 80 had received a booster, according to official data. Xia Gang, director of the health immunization division at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, attributed a lower vaccination rate among older people to their lack of awareness of the risks of COVID. Many with underlying health conditions were also concerned about side effects that may further restrict their mobility. In Zhongmin Village, Wang Yaqian, who works at the local community health care center, concurred that many older people were still wary of the vaccine’s side effects, adding that they were partnering with grassroots medics to gain their trust. She said the two-hour mobile vaccination camp has been vaccinating about 120 people, and on Wednesday many were there for their second or third shot, while over two dozen of them had come for their fourth booster. “The key is cooperation with family doctors,” she told Sixth Tone. “Locals have great trust in them. We have to cooperate with them to convince the elderly about getting vaccinated.” Experts say that vaccination against COVID remains one of the most essential defenses against the virus, especially for older people and those with long-term conditions. “Though vaccination cannot guarantee people from getting infected, it’s been confirmed that vaccination is essential to protect people from death or serious illness after infection,” Hu Bijie, director of the department of infectious diseases affiliated to Fudan University, told state media.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011952
"As Couriers Fall Sick, Chinese Cities Ask Residents to Fill In","The delivery sector is facing an acute shortage of staff, as workers get infected en masse.",2022-12-21,"Many Chinese cities are rallying local residents to temporarily join the delivery workforce, as mass COVID-19 infections cripple the sector that’s crucial in ferrying essential goods and services to millions every day. Shanghai on Tuesday became the latest to launch the initiative, as the city’s e-commerce chamber encouraged individuals currently not working or those with spare time to take up delivery jobs — but with regular pay and no additional incentives. In the past few days, Chongqing, Kaifeng, and Yangzhou, as well as many districts in Beijing, have used similar tactics to tackle the shortage of delivery workers amid the current wave of infection, according to media reports. “We encourage you to join the workforce and bring warmth to households in this special time,” the notice from the Shanghai E-Purchasing Chamber of Commerce said, while asking consumers to be more considerate of delayed deliveries and avoid direct contact during deliveries. Chen Keyi, a Chongqing-based resident who recently quit his job at an internet company, told Sixth Tone that he registered to become a part-time delivery worker last weekend after noticing a limited capacity in his community. “The platform now also offers a decent bonus for both the recruitment and the position,” the 23-year-old said, referring to extra payment for each delivery. Following the easing of certain measures linked to the “zero-COVID” policy, the unchecked COVID outbreak has rattled the delivery system nationwide, with many couriers either falling sick or returning to their hometowns earlier for Lunar New Year. Last week, the total number of parcels across China dropped 9.8% compared with the same period in November, based on data from the national transportation department. Residents in Shanghai, the eastern Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, as well as Guangdong province in the south told Sixth Tone they’ve experienced multiple issues in the past days — from the cancelation of orders and slow logistics to a hike in delivery charges. Shandong-based Zhang Xiao said her order for two boxes of milk had been canceled, while the oranges she bought had been stuck at a transfer facility for almost two weeks. “It feels like society is semi-paralyzed and I’ve never experienced a situation like this in the past three years of the pandemic,” Zhang said. The labor shortage has put additional stress on existing delivery workers, who now face longer working hours and increased workloads, domestic media reported. In the wake of the looming crisis, the State Post Bureau has urged related enterprises to ensure the delivery of medication and other essential supplies to residents, especially to those in rural areas. On Tuesday, the food delivery giant Meituan told local media that the number of delivery drivers in Beijing had recovered to 90% of the usual number. After vastly abandoning its COVID restrictions, China has been seeing an exponential surge of cases across the nation in the past two weeks. Experts suggest there will be 800 million infections in the next three months. Amid mounting concerns that the outbreak could disrupt production across sectors, several cities — including Chongqing, Wuhu, and Guiyang — have allowed infected staff at state-owned institutions with mild or no symptoms to work. Hospitals have also been encouraging their medical personnel to do the same, as rising cases have been putting pressure on the medical system.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011953
Winding Down ‘Zero-COVID’: The View From an Urban Village,A temporary security guard at an urban village witnessed the sudden winding down of the stringent policy.,2022-12-20,"On Nov. 30, Guangzhou lifted lockdowns in multiple areas and no longer required mass testing. Several other cities relaxed similar restrictions around the same time. More followed just a week later when the National Health Commission announced that China would pivot away from long-term lockdowns, and those infected with mild or no symptoms could isolate themselves at home. As the country enters the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the decisions marked the most significant relaxation in China’s strict “zero-COVID” policy. As millions across the country heaved a collective sigh of relief, a Weibo user named “BeichuanKafka” found herself unemployed. Again. This time, it happened just three days after she started working as a security guard at a large urban village in Guangzhou’s Panyu District. After graduating from a university in Chongqing, she previously worked at a major internet company in Guangzhou with a decent salary. But before completing six months of work, she was laid off. To pass the time, she turned to the only temporary job she could start immediately: working as a security guard who stopped quarantined residents from leaving their neighborhoods. Her role was part of the most basic unit of China’s epidemic prevention and control system. From her vantage point, BeichuanKafka first saw the stringent “zero-COVID” policy up close, and then the last three days before the policy was wound down. This is her story.  Endgame On Nov. 29, I worked until midnight and went home to sleep. When I woke up at noon the next day, my phone was full of messages saying that Guangzhou’s lockdown was lifted and that tests were no longer needed to travel within the city. I quickly opened an official post that read, “Districts including Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, and Panyu have lifted measures for temporary control areas.” In the group chat for our security team, I saw the next day’s work schedule with this message: “Don’t check for PCR test results anymore. Shifts at each checkpoint are cut in half.” I was stunned and spent the rest of the afternoon scrolling through my phone. The long-term lockdown had made me skeptical of any positive news like that. It only really hit me that Guangzhou was out of lockdown when I was on duty that afternoon. A few young people approached the entrance, and my colleague asked to scan their health code. Without even stopping, they laughed and said, “It’s just like a regular cold. We don’t have to scan to come in!” Nov. 30 was my last day as a security guard. I saw so many people walking out with suitcases that day. Flights leaving Guangzhou had shot up exponentially to around 2,000 yuan ($287), and trains were sold out. I heard that South Railway Station was full of scalpers reselling tickets at exorbitant prices. Even rideshares had skyrocketed from the usual per-person rate of 150 yuan to 600 yuan. I planned on leaving Guangzhou too. I hoped to head to Beijing or my hometown of Changsha, capital of the central Hunan province, and look for work there. But my main concern now is getting tested so that I can change my health code from yellow to green. (China’s colored health codes of red, yellow, and green indicate the individual’s COVID risk status and ability to travel). The problem is that all of Guangzhou’s testing sites have been shut down. My health code was actually yellow during my last two days as a security guard, but since I always checked other people’s codes nobody ever checked mine. I haven’t tested in a month.  Fired, hired This is the second time in one month that I’ve lost my job. The first was on Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. It was my 16th day in lockdown, and I was working at my rental home when my company called me. At first, I was excited by the news of the layoff. I didn’t have to work anymore and was basically paid to be on vacation. Freedom! But that night, other mixed emotions surfaced. There have been massive layoffs in the internet industry in the latter half of this year. I worked for a major livestreaming company that was on its third wave of layoffs, so I was mentally prepared for it; I just didn’t expect it to be so fast. As I was leaving, I glanced at the company group chat and saw that a quarter of the staff had been let go this year. I’m 22. I graduated from college this past June and had interned with Douyin, Kuaishou, and other companies while an undergrad, so my job search went pretty well. I’m from a small town in Hunan province, and when I got my job offer, I quickly became the pride of the whole family. After being laid off, I immediately wondered how I would explain this to my parents back home. That night, I finished almost an entire bottle of vodka. On Nov. 25, I went to the office to hand over my work. On the subway, I saw a post on WeChat from the urban village where I lived. It read: “Due to the need for epidemic prevention and control, we are recruiting temporary security personnel. 18 to 55 years, male or female. 150 yuan per day.” The next afternoon, I went to the village committee to apply for the job. The lobby had become a makeshift interview setting, with a plain wooden table placed in front of the head of security. He asked only one question: “Have you had three vaccine doses yet?” I was interviewed along with two slender, young girls. One worked at a clothing manufacturer, the other at a brick-and-mortar store. Both of their jobs were outside the urban village, and they couldn’t leave once we were locked down, so their managers marked them as absent and never paid them. They said becoming a security guard guaranteed them minimum income at the least. That night, the head of security added us to a WeChat group called “November 27.” The first message in the chat was, “Congratulations, you’re hired.”  Red armbands I officially started my security guard job on Nov. 27. Out of three shifts, I worked the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift. We didn’t have a uniform. Instead, we wore a red armband that allowed us to move freely through the urban village. My responsibilities were to guard the checkpoint and permit only incoming — never outgoing — traffic. I checked the non-residents for green health codes before they entered and also stopped residents from leaving. For those eligible to leave, I checked their permit or work certificate. The checkpoint was sealed with a rolling iron fence, flanked on both sides with a temporary sentry box. The fence opened with enough space for only one person to pass through. I got along best with a millennial colleague who was also from Hunan. Before the pandemic, he ran his own clothing store on Taobao and managed 75 people at its peak. Thanks to the low costs of making clothes in Guangzhou, his business had a daily turnover of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,437) and made 7,000 yuan in net profits. Being stationed at the checkpoint marked the first time in ten years that he had “worked.” Every day, he acted like it was something novel, saying “I’ve never experienced stable work like this” or “I got too lonely during lockdown and wanted to find people to talk to.” He never needed the money; he got the job purely to chat. We made 150 yuan each day, and the late-night food he treated me to cost 60-70 yuan alone. There were also two women in their early 20s. I called them Blue Hoodie and Red Vest. Blue Hoodie stood on her feet for the full eight-hour shift every day. Incredibly dedicated, she tried to reason with every resident trying to leave. “The pandemic is dire in Guangzhou right now, and there are close contacts within the village and a lot of yellow codes,” she would explain. “If there’s anything you don’t understand, please see the public announcement.” And residents would grow impatient and turn back. On the other hand, Red Vest just shouted at them. “Go read the announcement! Don’t keep me from doing my job!” When people tried to break through the checkpoint by force, she yelled: “Who do you think you are? If everyone acted the way you do, society would be a mess!” Asked if they could leave tomorrow, she always replied, “Who knows what’ll come first: tomorrow or the unknown?” Having started the job five days before me and my Hunan colleague, Red Vest often lectured us. “You’re too nice and smiley with people. You have to be meaner to get people to be afraid of you.” Our supervisor was a middle-aged man who usually stood beyond the traffic barriers, often smoking and scrolling on his phone. His bulging belly was barely contained within an overstretched shirt, which he always paired with tapered jeans and leather footwear. I called him Leather Shoes. When people tried to sneak by the younger guards, he stepped in to body block them. He was the adult and the “brute force” in the group. Meanwhile, I was the slacker of the group. Most of the time, I sat in the sentry box or behind the traffic barrier and read, listened to podcasts, or wrote my journal. When fights broke out, I was busy taking pictures and recording them. My Hunan colleague said that I bummed around for seven of the eight hours at work. The remaining one hour was spent eating.  Greasing the wheels The rule was that people could only enter but never exit. The only exceptions were those with permits or work certificates — usually property management staff or health personnel. Residents technically have no way to get a permit, but in reality, all you need is a stamp from the village committee, so there’s fluidity in that policy. Sometimes, the foreman of some construction site outside comes over to “facilitate goodwill.” They want the village committee’s stamp to get the migrant workers out to work. Residents without permits could only break out of the village, which ultimately forced us to concede based on how much trouble they might make. Once, a man in his 40s came into our village to run an errand. When he was stopped on his way out, he yelled, “Check my test! Check it! I’ve been testing for 30 days straight, and it’s all green codes! Are you still not letting me go home? What then? Do you want me to live at this checkpoint for the rest of my life?” Red Vest and Leather Shoes pulled him aside to ask if he had any proof. They suggested quietly that he show a random test result and then allowed him to leave. It was really all just an act, put on for everyone else who might think about trying to leave too. Whether to release someone without a permit was up to Leather Shoes, whose general principle was to avoid any commotion at the checkpoint. Disturbances can easily agitate people, and if all the residents rushed to the checkpoint, then the security team would be held responsible. Consequently, as soon as someone made a scene, Leather Shoes would implicitly let us know to turn a blind eye. One night, a clothing factory owner wanted to leave the urban village to go to work. He tried to slip out behind a delivery scooter but was caught by Red Vest and forced to return. But later, I saw him from afar as he was climbing over a six-foot-high iron sheet to escape. There were a lot of shared bikes parked in the village, and every day, there were a handful of residents who stepped up on the bike seats and catapulted themselves over the fence.  A few hours later, the same man came sauntering back into the village with a bag of supplies in his hand. We all pretended not to recognize him. I’ve also done my part in breaking the rules. There was an old lady from a nearby village who came to ours to buy vegetables, not knowing that she couldn’t leave afterward. She pleaded with each of us to let her out, saying that her disabled grandson was waiting alone at home for her. We all said no, so she sat quietly on a small stool by the checkpoint for over an hour. When there were fewer people around, I secretly opened the gates a little to let her slip out. That day, our security group caught 15 people with yellow codes and had 11 people try to rush the checkpoint. We photographed all of it and made a record of everyone in that latter group. Free range The security guards were tougher if they could communicate with you, or else they just stayed away. On my third day, I encountered two foreigners who ignored all the barriers. They entered and left freely, completely unfazed by the notices. When Red Vest stopped them the first time, they jabbered back in English. Red Vest covered her ears, saying, “Don’t talk to me. I don’t understand.” But as more people gathered around and watched, she had the foreigners present a random permit and then let them leave. After that, they were never stopped again.  Then came a couple that afternoon. The girl, who spoke Cantonese, started interrogating us as people online had said to do: “Why can’t we leave? Who made this rule? Who’s in charge? Which unit sent you here?” Her line of logic was clear, but Red Vest only replied, “Ask the village committee. I don’t know.” The Cantonese girl grew more emboldened as her questions grew louder. She almost managed to clear the checkpoint when her boyfriend pulled her away, saying, “Stop arguing. No is no. There’s no use asking them.” Incidentally, the multiple restrictions only affected people. Animals, however, roamed freely around. A young man wanted to take his sick dog to the vet, so he called a friend who lived outside and asked him to wait on the other side of the checkpoint. “Go on then,” he said to his white, curly-haired dog with a pat. As this tiny animal strolled coolly past us, we could do nothing but stare.  We jokingly told every animal that passed through the barrier, “Stop! No access allowed. You can’t leave — come back and take a PCR test!” They left; we laughed. But sometimes, a dog was obedient enough to actually come back.  The village had a curfew, and delivery workers weren’t allowed to enter after 10 p.m. One of our residents ran a barbeque business and had to come to the checkpoint late at night to hand over an order to the courier, who would then deliver it to the customer. My Hunan colleague saw him and casually remarked, “How exhausting, having to work this late.” The man suddenly burst out, “How would I live without working? You guys are still getting paid for being security guards, so you probably don’t want the lockdown lifted, but what about me? My children have school; we have to pay rent on the store in December; and I still have over 30,000 yuan in credit card debt to pay. What would I live on? I can’t if we stay locked down!” Up in the air On Dec. 1, all the guards were let go. The head of security issued a notice in the group chat that said, “As per higher authorities, there is no further need to check health codes, beginning this afternoon. All temporary staff are dismissed.” My Hunan colleague decided to go home and run his social media account. For Blue Sweater and Red Vest, their original jobs — the brick-and-mortar store and the factory — were both reopening, so they were going back there. I worked as a security guard for three days. I answered countless questions, though some were rhetorical, like: “If you don’t know why we’re locked down, then what are you doing? Are you all stupid and heartless?” What I said the most was “Wait for an announcement,” “I don’t know,” “You can’t leave,” “Scan your code to pass,” and “There’s no point asking us.” Everything that I saw, and everyone’s outbursts of emotions all became a spinning wheel in my head when I grew lost in thought: memories that were broken down and stored away, one by one. Up to now with the pandemic, I’ve gone through school, internships, jobs, and layoffs. I’ve bounced around a dozen cities, and now I’m about to leave Guangzhou again. Who knows how the COVID policy evolves after this? Have I really woken up from a dream, or is this the next dream? Perhaps I might never really know.

Why China Shouldn’t Let COVID Undo 40 Years of Urbanization,"The explosive spread of the COVID-19 seems to be souring policymakers and experts on high-density urbanism, but what does the data say?",2022-12-19,"Last week, China brought its “zero-COVID” policy to an abrupt end. According to the latest rules, lockdowns, centralized quarantines, and constant testing are now out, replaced by a renewed emphasis on the struggling economy. In Shanghai, officials have already stated they will “make every effort to consolidate the momentum of the city’s economic recovery.” But residents and investors cannot and will not forget how the city froze for two months this spring. The citywide lockdown hurt Shanghai’s economy, effectively halted the flow of people and goods, and left no sector, from industry to the public welfare, untouched. Shanghai’s was merely the largest of a series of disruptive urban lockdowns over the past three years. Cities across China, from Xi’an in the northwest to Jilin in the northeast and Sanya in the south, were shut down for weeks or months at a time; a few, like Ruili on the southwestern border, were sealed off for far longer. At the beginning of the pandemic, large, dense cities were viewed as especially susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases. Now, between the economic and psychological fallout of “zero-COVID”, sky-high real estate prices, and growing concern over “urban diseases” like traffic, many Chinese are questioning whether the past four decades of rapid urbanization might have gone too far. Similar criticisms were leveled at large cities in the West during the initial wave of COVID-19 outbreaks there. But are the downsides of population agglomeration really enough to offset its well-documented role in boosting labor productivity, innovation, and consumer service industries? There are two separate issues under discussion here: population size and population density. In terms of the former, my own research team has found no strong correlation between population size and “urban diseases” like traffic. We found that doubling a city’s population increased average commute times by just 2.3 minutes. The coefficient between the urban congestion index — which measures the delta between commuting during peak hours and off hours — and population size is also very slight. As for population density, the density of a population is related to a city’s natural and geographical conditions and whether the government strictly controls outward development. According to an analysis of data from large cities around the world, controlling for the population size of a city, high population density alleviates urban congestion, especially in cities with populations in excess of 10 million. While this may seem counterintuitive, the underlying reasoning is simple: The industrial structure of large cities is usually dominated by services, which require people to meet up with one another. The development of compact, denser cities facilitates this, reducing the distance and costs involved in travel. In some circumstances, such as during the outbreak of an infectious disease, discussions of population density must further distinguish between typical urban residential density and their potential density after implementing social distancing procedures. When people are aware of the transmission risk, they can take steps to reduce movement and implement social distancing. The city’s population density does not change, but infection risk is lowered even as high density allows for the more efficient provision of medical services. My team analyzed Chinese cities using data from a three-month period after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in 2020. We found that the stronger a city’s economic ties were with Wuhan, the higher the rate of infection in that city. However, after controlling for the possible spread of the virus between cities due to economic links, cities with a high population density had lower infection rates than their less dense peers.  In other words, we shouldn’t see urbanization and population density as potential problems just because of how pandemic prevention was carried out in large cities like Shanghai. At present, China remains committed to urban development, and the trend of population agglomeration in urban areas is showing no signs of slowing down. Although there are real issues associated with population growth in large cities, such as insufficient living space and high prices, these are solvable problems if tackled directly, rather than indirectly through attempts to control population growth. And yet, I have noticed a trend in Chinese urban policy circles of treating urban populations as a problem to be “solved” by controlling their growth. This strikes me as misguided. Shouldn’t we allow individuals and businesses to decide for themselves whether the potential downsides of large cities are outweighed by their benefits? If anything, attempts to control urban growth, such as limiting land use, often exacerbate cities’ problems by increasing housing prices and reducing the efficiency of urban services. Looking at the challenges to urban development throughout history, from the Broad Street cholera outbreak in London more than 100 years ago to the severe industrial pollution that plagued Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles in the 20th century, cities have shown themselves to be exceptionally resilient. I believe Shanghai and other major Chinese cities will prove no different. The key is working to improve residents’ lives, not trying to control where and how they live.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011925
China Sees Looming Blood Shortage as COVID Spreads,"Donors have dwindled in at least eight provinces, with many staying away from crowded spaces due to the coronavirus surge.",2022-12-19,"China is facing a blood supply shortage at hospitals amid a major coronavirus outbreak despite the country’s top health authority relaxing stringent curbs deterring certain COVID-19 patients from donating. The National Health Commission canceled a ban restricting asymptomatic carriers and those from at-risk areas from donating blood, according to a revised COVID protocol on blood donation released Sunday. Those sick with mild symptoms can also donate seven days after they last tested positive, unlike before when they had to wait for six months, even amid a lack of research indicating whether the virus is transmissible via blood transfusion. The announcement came as at least eight provinces have declared a blood crisis since early December, with the number of donors decreasing dramatically, domestic media Caixin reported Sunday. The regional blood center in the eastern province of Jiangsu on Tuesday said that the overall stock had dropped to a dangerously low level, as the supply of type A blood could only meet clinical needs for three days. “Many blood donation campaigns at universities and public institutions have been scaled down or canceled due to the previous restrictions on large gatherings, while many individuals are also afraid of getting infected amid the outbreak,” a spokesperson for the Jiangsu Province Blood Center told Sixth Tone on Monday. “The number of donors and the amount of blood collected in December decreased by 57% and 54% year-on-year, respectively.” Authorities in the eastern province of Shandong also announced on Dec. 9 that they were facing similar issues, with an extremely low supply of A and O blood types. A blood collection center in Guangzhou urged local residents for help, offering incentives such as masks, antigen test kits, and shopping vouchers in exchange. A Shandong-based resident, whose mother is currently hospitalized for ovarian cancer and leukemia, told Sixth Tone the hospital where she is being treated is short of platelets and she had failed to secure blood cells at the local blood center. “I feel really anxious since the level of platelets in her body is extremely low right now,” the 34-year-old said. “The blood is crucial for continuing her life and medical treatment.” The blood shortage adds to the mounting concerns over the country’s ability to tackle surging COVID cases, especially in protecting critically ill patients after loosening its long-standing anti-virus curbs. With mass testing stopped, it’s nearly impossible to determine how widespread the outbreak is, though some models estimate there will be 800 million infections in the next three months. The rising infections have posed challenges to the country’s health care system, especially those in rural areas with inadequate resources and personnel compared with bigger cities. And even as the central government has ordered local governments to build more fever clinics and adjusted its blood donation guidelines, they haven’t been able to completely allay concerns. The spokesperson from the Jiangsu Province Blood Center told Sixth Tone that the number of donations has barely changed so far, as many people were afraid of being infected. This has limited them from coming to designated locations to donate blood. China enacted its Blood Donation Law in 1998, upholding voluntary non-paid donations, and though the number of donors has significantly improved in recent decades, the supply hasn’t been sufficient enough. In 2021, the nationwide blood donation rate was 1.2%, behind the average of 1.6% in middle-income countries, according to the National Health Commission.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011923
Chinese Artist Nut Brother Crowdfunds Medicine for Rural Elderly,A short supply of medicine amid a rise in COVID infections has left many scrambling for essential drugs.,2022-12-19,"One of China’s best-known activist artists is pleading with people to donate money and medicine to the country’s rural areas which are facing an explosion of COVID-19 infections and — unlike bigger cities — may not be well-equipped to manage the outbreak. Commonly referred to by his alias Nut Brother, the 41-year-old artist told Sixth Tone that he first thought of the idea last Wednesday, a week after China suddenly removed many of its strict restrictions used to keep the coronavirus at bay. On Thursday, he made a plea on social platform WeChat in the hope of gathering anti-fever medicine for older residents in non-urban areas. “I want to do as much as I can to help those in need,” said Nut Brother, who first grabbed national and international attention in 2015 by vacuuming Beijing’s polluted air to raise awareness on the smog choking millions of residents. He has since used his art installation projects to shed spotlight on environmental and education issues, among others. China is currently witnessing a massive surge in COVID infections, two weeks into the loosening of its policy which ended mass testing and lockdowns. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of people have been catching the virus on a daily basis, and pharmacies have been running out of common anti-cold and fever medicine such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Such shortages are particularly pronounced in rural areas, with many social media users slamming urbanites for grabbing their much-needed stock last week, and the government has promised to improve the reach of health care. Nut Brother said that he planned to collect 5,000 boxes of anti-fever medicine and distribute them to 2,500 people over the age of 60 in Xiaohaotu, northwestern Shaanxi province. The artist said he chose Xiaohaotu as he had cooperated with the locals on his previous project about water pollution, but plans to expand to other places after assessing the situation. “Given the fact that the medication shortage is a widespread problem across the nation, the elderly in rural areas are in a more difficult situation compared to those in urban areas, because they don’t have as much access to the internet to ask for help and they are more reluctant to go to hospital,” said Nut Brother. China is home to about 260 million people over the age of 60, who are vulnerable to the virus, and a quarter of the population in rural areas falls in that demographic. Some 25 million in that age bracket weren’t vaccinated against COVID as of November, and only 40% of those over the age of 80 had received booster shots, further raising the risk of severe illness from the disease. By publication time, Nut Brother’s team had raised over 110,000 yuan ($15,765) in cash, and using the funds to purchase enough medicine for those in need remained a challenge. Nut Brother said he is approaching pharmaceutical companies for help, with one already promising to offer assistance. Meanwhile, his friends in Baoding, central Hebei province, have already collected 700 yuan worth of medicine and had sent them to a few older Xiaohaotu residents. He added that he was now receiving some extra medicine from Beijing, as the supply has likely relatively improved. “But that’s way less than enough … and now we’re faced with a shortage of delivery workers at the same time, right?” referring to the growing number of sick couriers. “Maybe the best way to help with the situation is to encourage donating and exchanging spare medicine among citizens.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011924
"As COVID Spreads, China Acts to Protect Rural Residents",Authorities have ordered local officials to set up more fever clinics and recruit retired medical workers to alleviate pressure on the health system.,2022-12-16,"Chinese authorities have rallied local officials to safeguard rural residents, as surging infections are likely to put this group, who have limited exposure to health care, at greater health risks. In a national guideline released Friday, the Joint Control and Prevention Mechanism of the State Council, or China’s Cabinet, urged local officials to increase staffing in rural clinics and hospitals. Such workers have also been exempted from conducting regular virus testing, which should be entrusted to third-party agencies and volunteers. “In the short term, we advise higher-tier hospitals to send their staff to rural areas, while local medical agencies can also recruit employees who have retired in the past five years and medical workers from other positions to alleviate pressure,” Nie Chunlei, a senior official from the National Health Commission, said in a press conference Thursday. After sticking to the “zero-COVID” policy for almost three years, China abruptly eased the strict curbs, allowing home quarantine for patients with mild or no symptoms. Though official figures are undercounted since mass testing ended, there have been reports of surging infections, especially in cities such as Beijing. While the nation’s medical system is expected to meet the mounting pressure amid rising infections, rural areas — home to about 36% of the country’s 1.4 billion people — face even greater challenges due to the inadequate medical resources compared with bigger cities. In 2019, China had only 1.8 physicians for every 1,000 people in rural areas, compared to four physicians for every 1,000 people in urban areas, according to the National Health Commission. On social media, posts of older residents in rural areas struggling to secure fever medicines and medical treatments have emerged in the past few days, with many advocating urbanites to donate the medicine that they have stocked up on. Domestic media reported that some regions have already seen a severe shortage of personnel in township and village clinics, with frontline workers calling for assistance. Friday’s guideline comes amid a raft of measures introduced by top authorities in the past week to avert possible public health crises in rural regions. On Sunday, the State Council asked local authorities to optimize their health care system, while emphasizing the protection of the elderly and those infected with severe symptoms, by improving Intensive Care Units in county-level hospitals. “The number of ICU beds for critically ill patients infected with the coronavirus should account for at least 4% of the total number of beds in a county hospital by the end of December,” the guideline said, adding each bed should be equipped with a medical team of one doctor and two to three nurses. The country’s top health authority also said that township hospitals should establish a fever clinic as far as possible and keep it open all day. By the end of October, a total of 19,400 clinics had been established, covering 45% of the township hospitals and community medical service centers, according to Nie.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011911
China’s Elderly Care Homes on Guard to Keep COVID Out,Many care homes are said to be facing difficulties ranging from a shortage of medical supplies to no access to hospitals.,2022-12-16,"With China ditching most of its pandemic control strategies and the coronavirus spreading unchecked, the country’s elderly care homes are struggling to protect their older residents who are most vulnerable to the virus. In megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai, nursing home staff and residents have isolated themselves from the outside world fearing virus transmission. Many care homes are also said to be facing a range of difficulties, from a shortage of medical supplies to no access to hospitals and a lack of emergency plans to deal with infections, domestic media reported Thursday. A manager of a nursing home in Beijing, surnamed Tian, told Sixth Tone that he felt “stressed out” by potential COVID outbreaks at the care facility which accommodates some 40 residents, mostly over the age of 70. “Our nursing facility is closed, but the spread of the virus cannot be completely cut off,” said the 47-year-old. “For example, it’s impossible to disinfect every leaf of cabbage transported from outside.” As China eased its virus control measures last week, COVID-19 has spread at an alarming pace, though official numbers don’t reflect the reality on the ground as authorities have stopped mass testing and counting asymptomatic cases. On Thursday, the country only logged 2,091 symptomatic cases, far less than the tens of thousands of cases just a few weeks ago. In an aging society like China, with over 260 million people aged over 60, COVID infections could deal a heavy blow to the country’s nursing homes, which had an over 8.2 million bed capacity by 2020. This has proved to be the case in several countries like the United States and United Kingdom, and was further seen during the spring outbreak in Shanghai, where the virus created chaos at a local nursing home. Adding to the challenge is the large number of older people who have either not been vaccinated against COVID or received a booster shot. As of late November, 25 million people over the age of 60 had not been vaccinated, and only around 40% of people aged over 80 have had booster shots, according to official data. Officials have urged older residents to get vaccinated, with the second booster shot plan for those over 60 rolled out on Wednesday. They also vowed to ensure an adequate medicine supply for nursing homes and other places in urgent need amid a shortage of medical resources. So far, Tian, the Beijing nursing home manager, has had to rely on himself. In the past weeks, he has spent over 3,000 yuan ($430) on cold, cough, and fever medicines through the help of friends outside Beijing amid shortages. But he is yet to receive the items he ordered two weeks ago due to issues with deliveries in the capital, as many couriers have been infected, too. Tian said his nursing home was running out of rapid antigen self-test kits as around 50 people inside the nursing home would take one test per day. He said there were just over 200 of them left and replenishing them has been extremely difficult. “We have an emergency plan about putting infected older people in quarantine on a separate floor,” Tian said, adding that some 200 inpatient beds at the care home’s nearest hospital were all occupied last week. “If their situations get worse, we can only send them to hospitals where there is an empty bed.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011910
Life After the End of China’s COVID Restrictions,‘Be the first person responsible for your own health’ is China’s new COVID slogan. Living up to it is easier said than done.,2022-12-15,"China conducted its strict “zero-COVID” policy for nearly three years but last Wednesday announced a definitive move away from this long-held and extremely strict approach. The Chinese government also put forward a new COVID slogan: “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” implying a willingness to join the rest of the world in living with the coronavirus. Changes were made quickly, with an end to citywide lockdowns, health code checks when traveling, and everyone being required to have a negative nucleic acid test result. The abrupt policy shift left ordinary Chinese not only feeling a sense of joy from their newfound freedom, but also confusion toward their new life in which they would have to co-exist with COVID. Meanwhile, COVID-19 infections spread rapidly across China. The anxiety of being infected sparked panic buying of fever medicines and painkillers, leading to shortages online and in stores. Even canned peaches, which are rich in vitamin C, have been flying off the shelves, with people hoarding them in the hope of preventing infection from COVID-19.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011904
Trainee Doctor’s Death Spurs Questions About Overworked Medics,"While chat logs and medical records suggest the student doctor was infected with the coronavirus, his university didn’t give any details.",2022-12-15,"The death of a Chinese medical student has highlighted the heavy workload and low pay among trainee doctors, many of whom are on the frontline of China’s spiraling COVID-19 outbreak, which is straining the country’s health care system and personnel.  The 23-year-old student, surnamed Chen, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday night after attempts to resuscitate him for over 24 hours failed, according to a statement by the renowned West China Hospital of Sichuan University in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Chen, a first-year graduate student at the hospital’s School of Medicine, passed out Tuesday after finishing his clinical work that day, the hospital said in an earlier statement. Chat logs and medical records circulating online implied that Chen had tested positive for COVID-19 and had a fever for three days, but was asked to continue working by his mentor. The two announcements didn’t mention whether Chen had been infected, though the hospital told Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, that Chen started to have a fever Tuesday afternoon. The tragedy comes as China suddenly lifted almost all of its virus control measures last week. The move has resulted in an explosion of cases, putting stress on its medical system and leading to a shortage of medical staff. In regions inundated by coronavirus cases, infected health care workers have had to continue working to keep hospitals running, domestic media reported. In Beijing, the city reported 22,000 visits to fever clinics Sunday, 16 times higher than the figure from the previous week, municipal health officials said. While it’s unclear whether Chen’s death was related to the infection, the tragedy has again put the spotlight on China’s standardized training system for resident doctors, which has been criticized for exploiting young health care workers for a long time. Implemented in 2015, the program requires medical students to receive their clinical training either while studying or after graduation and before they go to the frontline. However, they often receive a meager income and are overloaded with work during the training period. Nearly half of some 3,000 doctors said they had a monthly income of lower than 2,000 yuan ($285) during the training program, while 8% of them said they weren’t paid anything, according to a 2020 survey conducted by Dingxiangyuan, one of China’s most popular online platforms for health professionals. Meanwhile, nearly 82% of those surveyed said they worked for over eight hours a day, with 7.2% of them working for 12 hours daily. Prior to Chen’s death, hundreds of medical students in several universities across China had been protesting against their intense workload and poor salary in the past week. They demanded better protective measures against COVID and equal pay as full-time hospital employees, among others, according to videos circulating online.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011903
Beijing’s COVID Surge Stretches City’s Delivery Workforce,Courier companies are transferring workers from other cities and offering more pay to meet the demand for mounting orders.,2022-12-15,"China’s coronavirus-stricken cities are stacking up more challenges onto overloaded delivery networks, highlighting the logistical pressures the country may face after stringent pandemic control measures were stopped earlier this month. The State Post Bureau, which regulates the country’s postal services, called on delivery companies Tuesday to send couriers from other parts of the country to Beijing to support the capital city while prioritizing last-mile deliveries for medicine and health care products. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Beijing is currently under assault from the coronavirus, with authorities saying that the number of fever patients had surged to 22,000 on Sunday, 16 times higher than the figure the previous week. Chinese cities that have been weathering coronavirus outbreaks recently are facing a shortage of delivery forces due to mounting orders following an increase in COVID cases and the “Double Twelve” shopping festival, according to media reports. The rising number of delivery workers who have been infected and couriers returning to their hometowns earlier for Lunar New Year next month have worsened the shortage, especially in Beijing. The manager of a logistics distribution center in Beijing, which employs more than 40 delivery personnel, told local media that nearly half of the workers have been sick with COVID. Another executive from YTO Express said they were facing a labor shortage despite doubling daily pay to 400 yuan ($55). Beijing residents Sixth Tone spoke with, who had all tested positive for COVID, said they had encountered different degrees of difficulty when ordering food and groceries online and faced delayed deliveries for their parcels. White-collar worker Emilie Wang said her purchases made on Monday would only arrive a week later “due to changes in COVID prevention measures,” an unusually long time for people used to next-day deliveries. “To buy fresh food online, I need to set an alarm for 6 a.m. each morning so that I can place orders before all the delivery workers are booked for the day,” said Wang, adding that she and her husband decided to stay indoors to avoid infecting others. Amid a labor shortage, thousands of couriers from delivery companies including JD.com, STO Express, and SF Express were transferred to Beijing as of Wednesday, with employers promising increased pay and welfare for the workers, according to the State Post Bureau. A spokesperson from Meituan told Sixth Tone that the food delivery platform was also recruiting drivers, while a representative from on-demand delivery app JD Daojia said they planned to attract drivers by offering more incentives. Outside of Beijing, metropolises such as Chongqing and Guangzhou have also started to see a rise in coronavirus infections. The virus is likely to spread to the rest of the country, including eastern, northwestern, and northeastern regions, around the beginning of next year, according to data compiled by the stock trading and finance information service Tonghuashun.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011896
"Fearing Infection, Many Chinese Grab Unproven Items to Prevent COVID",Canned peaches and electrolyte water have been flying off the shelves amid unsubstantiated claims that they defend against the coronavirus.,2022-12-14,"Many Chinese are trying to guard themselves against the coronavirus by using unproven remedies, as some common symptomatic medicines remain out of stock amid a massive surge in infections. Canned peaches, which are rich in vitamin C, and electrolyte water have emerged as the most popular items to fly off the shelves across the nation, with people hoarding them in the hope of preventing infection from COVID-19. While online posts tout their health benefits, there is no scientific data backing up the claims that they can prevent people from getting COVID. China’s leading online grocer Hema Xiansheng saw a sharp rise in demand for canned peaches starting Thursday, a day after China lifted curbs central to its “zero-COVID” policy, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper. By Friday, the fruit, which has a longer shelf life, was sold out at Shanghai’s Hema stores, with other supermarkets such as Aldi and Carrefour also reporting higher demand for the item over the weekend. “It’s a tradition that whenever we get sick, we eat canned peaches,” said 23-year-old Liu Chen from the northeastern city of Dalian, who now lives in Shanghai. “The cans may keep us away from sickness. The pronunciation of peach sounds similar to that of escape. The god of canned peaches will bless every child.”  As China abandons its strict measures that have kept the virus at bay for three years, there have been reports of an exponential surge in infections, though official figures are grossly undercounted since mass testing is no longer being carried out. The country’s top health authority on Wednesday announced that it will stop publishing the number of asymptomatic infections in its daily COVID tally. Fearing infections, people are turning to unproven remedies to boost their immunity and keep them healthy against the coronavirus — a trend seen from India to the United States amid soaring cases in the past years. Over the past few days, social media has been flooded with people sharing posts about their infections and recovery diaries, mostly in the capital Beijing. Many complained that over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, as well as the traditional Chinese medicine Lianhua Qingwen, were unavailable at pharmacies. Domestic media reported that many symptomatic medicines to treat fevers, coughs, and colds had been sold out in many pharmacies across the country. Some metropolises, including Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai, had also run out of the N95 masks that are believed to offer better protection against the highly infectious Omicron strains than regular surgical masks. Responding to the medicine shortage in Beijing, the deputy director of the city’s drug administration on Monday said that the municipal government was working to deploy additional resources, encourage factories to expand production, and crack down on price gouging. Authorities have also pleaded with people to stop hoarding medicines and refrain from self-medicating or using unapproved treatments. Apart from canned peaches, many people were also hoarding electrolyte water, with demand for the item skyrocketing by 2,000% on the e-commerce platform JD.com between last Wednesday and Thursday, according to The Paper. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended drinking water with a certain amount of electrolytes in its COVID prevention guidance published in 2020. “It’s more of a mental comfort for me,” said Liu, who had stocked up on canned peaches but not electrolyte water. “It’s better than nothing, right? I haven’t got any medicines with me now. Even if I get COVID, the canned peaches are delicious.” On lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu, tens of thousands of people have also been discussing how to secure certain medicines from smaller cities and villages, where the surge of the outbreak hasn’t been as big as in bigger metropolises. Many said they were anxious about not being able to stock up on essential medicines but were met with criticism instead. “Please, those from urban places, don’t be drug scalpers. Don’t compete for medical resources with us,” said a user on microblogging platform Weibo, referring to the discussions on Xiaohongshu. “Give those of us from underdeveloped places a chance to live.” On Tuesday, the healthcare platform 1 Pharmacy began selling American pharmaceutical company Pfizer’s oral COVID treatment pill Paxlovid for 2,980 yuan ($430) per box, which is currently not covered under the national health insurance scheme. The drug reportedly sold out in an hour and was “so popular that we have to take it down for now,” the pharmacy was quoted as saying by financial media outlet Caixin.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011888
China Relaxes COVID Rules. But Are People Relieved?,Sixth Tone speaks with people from various walks of life to gauge the public mood after the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions.,2022-12-12,"China’s long war against COVID-19 appears to be tapering off. After three years of relentless mass testing and lockdowns to defeat an “invisible enemy,” the country abruptly relaxed its strict anti-virus policies Wednesday, signaling a willingness to join the rest of the world in living with the coronavirus. The announcement came as a relief for hundreds and millions of people whose lives and livelihoods had been largely upended since the pandemic started. But the relaxed rules have also sown confusion, as ordinary Chinese waver between anticipation of the end of the pandemic and anxiety over the very real dangers still posed by COVID. Sixth Tone spoke to people across different demographics and geographic locations to find out their thoughts on the sudden policy change. Hu Yujie, 21 University studentChengdu, Sichuan province When I heard about the relaxation of the COVID policy, I felt a sense of hidden danger. It seemed that all the protection just disappeared, and I’m not sure what life will be like in the future — is it real? Will I be infected soon? Will the policy change again? However, I think the rules will be completely abandoned in the future, people’s lives will return to normal, and fewer people will talk about it. COVID-19 will remain part of everyone’s collective subconsciousness. As soon as I left the campus gates, all my worries and anxiety faded. I applied to leave school on Dec. 9 to visit Jiangxi province. I first noticed how easy it was to enter the railway station without having to deal with all the travel and health codes. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen so many strangers apart from students. I felt relaxed, happy, and relieved when I was at the railway station after a long period of stress.  Lu Mei, 30 Pregnant womanShanghai Before being pregnant, I longed for the loosening of the strict “zero-COVID” policy every day: I wanted to hang out with friends, travel around the country, and fulfill my dream of having a honeymoon in France. I wasn’t afraid of being infected by COVID-19 at all. But now, I don’t even dare to step out of my apartment. I’ve asked for a long period of time off from work, and last week I only went out once, to a grocery shop next to my residential complex. Even a common cold will be tough during pregnancy; who knows whether the coronavirus will hurt my baby? There’s still half a year until my due date, and I believe the policy will be clearer by then. I’ll still stick to wearing masks and ensure I have hand sanitizer while going out. I want to minimize the risks as much as I can.  Jin Huimin, 59Director of nephrology department, Shanghai Pudong HospitalShanghai We’re expecting the first group of COVID-19 positive patients this week. The medical staff are generally in good spirits, although we’re under great stress. The hospital has booked two hotels for quarantine once they’re infected, as going home risks infecting our families. We’ve prepared 50 dialysis machines where we previously used to accommodate inbound passengers who tested positive. We have the resources and space but are concerned about a possible shortage of health care workers. We are training more nurses from other departments for dialysis patients, but it’s difficult to train doctors in a short period of time. There are 12 doctors and 33 nurses serving nearly 500 patients with kidney failure who visit regularly for dialysis. Honestly, at the moment, we have no idea if the doctors’ team can cope with the first wave of COVID infections. What I can do now is inform and educate more kidney failure patients that they must be vaccinated against COVID and receive two booster shots for their own benefit. Many people still don’t understand the vaccines well enough and are afraid of receiving the shots. But I’m trying to make patients aware that these shots are vital to them.  Liu, 40Pharmacy staffWuhu, Anhui province We are out of Lianhua Qingwen (traditional Chinese medicine), paracetamol, and ibuprofen. There has been a shortage of medicine since people heard about the loosening of the COVID policy. There are many forms of dosage, specifications, and manufacturers of ibuprofen. As a pharmacy chain, we normally don’t store much of it. Even Lianhua Qingwen is now sold out, and we always have it well stocked. We are doing everything we can to prepare medicines for people needing them. *Liu is a surname  Zhong Lan, 63RetireeShanghai Previously, I mostly wouldn’t wear a mask while going to stores and wet markets, as infected people were quarantined under strict COVID restrictions. I’m much more careful now. Wearing a mask at groceries stores is a must for me now. I also wash my hands and disinfect my bags and clothes after returning home. Although I’ve been vaccinated and don’t have serious illnesses, I’m still a bit worried about getting infected and its impact on my health. The ailments during the infection may be tolerable, but my main concern is the aftermath. After all, the disease is quite new, and it remains to be seen whether there’s really no sequela or other consequences. It’s like we are now holding on to the stones to cross the river.  Wu, 50Unvaccinated parentTianjin I didn’t get vaccinated and neither did my daughter. I haven’t been well since my rheumatism diagnosis. My doctor discouraged me from getting vaccinated. The situation is the same for my younger daughter. After the relaxation of the COVID policy, we are trying to go out as little as possible to reduce the chance of getting infected. We’ve stored some N95 masks at home if we need to go outside. However, the masks are now in short supply at pharmacies. Omicron is so contagious that I think getting infected is merely a matter of time regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not. The long-term effects of the virus are unclear. It would be a lie if I say I’m not afraid. *Wu is a surname  Peipei, 32Mother of a newbornBeijing During the past three years, I’ve realized it’s impossible to entirely get rid of the virus from our lives, and the long lockdowns have affected people’s mental health. So I’m totally supportive of the opening up. But I have a six-month-old newborn and older family members. My mother couldn’t be vaccinated due to her allergy history. I was wondering whether there would be a buffer period before the opening up, so that the government could issue more children- and elderly-friendly policies to protect them. I guess the following months may be chaotic. I’ve heard from other mothers that hospitals are crowded with more COVID-positive cases. I now have no idea about arranging my daughter’s regular medical checkups and vaccinations. She also needs a hip ultrasound before the end of this month, but I’m still hesitating right now. But I’m glad the opening up will make it easier to visit my grandparents in Hebei province. I haven’t had a chance to go back to my hometown since my daughter was born. After three years of the pandemic, I’m really looking forward to a big and warm family reunion. *Peipei is a pseudonym  Zhang Minghui, 21Tech company internBeijing I felt China’s easing of COVID-19 rules was abrupt — the policy would have been relaxed at some point, but I didn’t expect it to happen so rapidly. Suddenly, I didn’t need a negative PCR test result to go to work. But life hasn’t been easy though. The speed of infection is surging, and the fear of infection has replaced the worries associated with excessive epidemic prevention. People don’t know much about dealing with infections or treatment. We browsed the internet to learn more about potentially effective medicine and started hoarding some. Many of my colleagues are infected, but we’re still required to come to the office. I have no option but to risk infection. While I feel alright being infected, I worry about the impact on my family and pets, considering what happened to them during the epidemic prevention. Life will never be the same as it was before 2019. Chinese people may find it difficult to get over the trauma even after gaining complete control of the virus.  Li Zhongyue, 52Truck driverQiqihar, Heilongjiang province Over the past three years, I have spent countless days stranded on highways in the middle of nowhere and being forced to eat and sleep in the vehicle. So when the state eased the pandemic control measures and finally ended “closed-loop” management requirements for freight truck drivers last week, I was so relieved. Truck drivers earn based on how many trips they do. The COVID-induced business shutdowns reduced our work opportunities and onerous requirements for negative COVID test results brought uncertainty to our trips. Routes that normally took a day or two could be delayed to three or four days in some cases. Before the pandemic, I would take short trips every day or every other day. But reduced work and logjams on the road have reduced my jobs to one trip every three or four days. With some check stations on highways being removed recently, I expect to get more jobs over the next few months.  Yuan, 53University dormitory managerShanghai I’m quite relieved. I prefer the relaxation of the rules because it’s the only way for the country to develop its economy. And only then can we enjoy a better life and welfare. As a dormitory manager on campus, I’m required to have negative PCR test results every 24 hours, but it’s convenient to do so. I’m optimistic about the policy change and think that life will return to normal, as it was before COVID. Infections are not a concern as long as we maintain personal protection. Even if I get infected, I wouldn’t be concerned because the virus is weaker. It’ll be like catching a cold. However, I am concerned that young children may suffer some side effects or sequelae after being vaccinated or infected. *Yuan is a surname  Li Xiaohong, 50Middle school teacherChengdu, Sichuan province It’s been a torment for both teachers and students over the past three years. After taking online classes for three weeks in September, we returned to school, but with rigid PCR test protocols — it was annoying and disruptive. Earlier last week, students were asked to take it in turns to do COVID tests, with 20% of them in class each day. Since Friday, we have finally gotten rid of the PCR tests. I feel more relaxed and comfortable now. I don’t need to think about the PCR tests all day. Personally, I never took it seriously, but our school was always nervous about any potential outbreaks. Also, I don’t need to show test results to enter gyms or swimming pools unlike before. I can go anywhere I want freely.  Zhang Min, 25 ProgrammerXi’an, Shaanxi province I have mixed feelings about the sudden loosening of COVID restrictions. I need some time to adapt to it. It’s like two extremes. While I don’t have to do PCR tests as often as before — sometimes once a day — now there aren’t enough testing stations, resulting in long lines of people waiting. Such spots shouldn’t have been removed all of a sudden following the relaxation of policies. On Thursday, I planned to take a PCR test, which is still required for entering hospitals. It took me an hour and a half, and there were hundreds of people there. It’s annoying and troublesome. It was difficult to stand in line in such cold weather. And there were some elderly people queuing up, too. Also, I’m worried about the increasing risk of getting infected when going out, as negative COVID test results are not required for entering most places. I still fear feeling ill, suffering from symptoms, and my work being affected due to the infection.  Huang Qian, 22Master’s studentShanghai Like many universities in Shanghai, our school moved all classes online and encouraged us to return home last Thursday. The abrupt policy change has been surprising and now many of my classmates are worried about getting infected during the journey. For those planning to stay, the rules haven’t changed much. We still need a PCR test result from the past 48 hours to get into campus and are only allowed to leave for 15 minutes — otherwise, our school health code will turn red, barring us from re-entry. But since Nov. 29, we’re finally allowed to apply for a long leave, though we need to apply for that every time, and the approval depends on the counselor. Eventually, I think the campus will be fully open. I feel a sense of relief knowing my parents can finally visit my school and see what it’s like. I missed out on my undergraduate graduation ceremony and hopefully I can make up for it this time.  Han Xuehong, 49ParentDeyang, Sichuan province After taking online classes for two weeks, my 16-year-old daughter finally returned to school this Monday. The school said parents could choose whether students return or not. So far, apart from the students who have COVID, most of them preferred to go to school. My daughter is a high school senior and will take the gaokao — college entrance exam — next year, but it’s easy for her to get distracted when taking online classes at home. It was also a burden for parents, as it disrupted our work and life balance, and we had to shoulder more responsibilities. I feel more relaxed now. We may all end up getting infected, so what’s the point of dragging out the loosening of restrictions? The COVID control measures were extremely annoying.  Zhou Zhixue, 30 Village cooperative headXishuangbanna, Yunnan province I mostly stayed in my hometown of Hebian for the past year but have now traveled to Jinghong City to discuss work opportunities as COVID rules are relaxed. The lockdowns earlier this year have affected our farming. We couldn’t even take my brother to the hospital for his surgery straight away. Now that the policy is being relaxed, I’m quite happy because we can now go out and do a lot of things. In the last two years, Hebian didn’t receive travelers due to virus control rules and other requirements, so people had to rely on farming to make a living instead. I’ll return soon and restart our guesthouse business. Our guesthouse business has been deserted for two years. Many villagers may not be as motivated and interested in it as before. This is an issue I’ll need to address.  Xiu Chunlei, 36Acupuncturist Harbin, Heilongjiang province In Harbin, I can’t say if the policy has been completely relaxed or not — I don't even know which direction we’re heading. On one hand, the government is telling people not to do PCR tests if it’s unnecessary, but restaurants and other indoor places still require a 48-hour negative result — it discourages people from going out. But, unlike before, I wasn’t required to do a test after arriving in Harbin from my hometown. There are fewer people on the streets in Harbin now. The cold temperatures may be a factor, but the streets are just depressing. Personally, I’m not worried about contracting the virus, and I don’t want to hoard cold and flu medicines. My colleagues and family members seem scared though, thanks to videos on social media that say how bad the virus is. Even some of the professors I know believe such information, and when I try to argue with them, they say I’ve been “westernized.”  Wang Zhe, 36Personal shopperJi’an, Jilin province For me, there have been no changes. Before the new policy, we were required to scan a provincial health code while going to public places. Now, we need to scan a location code instead, which is basically the same thing. So it’s pointless. I used to be very afraid of catching the virus, but after learning about it for so long, I don’t feel so scared anymore. We need to focus on personal protection, and try not to get infected. I am still worried, because after all, the elderly are not in good health, even if they’re fully vaccinated. Now everyone is hoarding Lianhua Qingwen, but I didn’t bother buying it. I’ve stocked up on some regular cold and anti-inflammatory medicines at home.  Bai Shu, 23Postgraduate exam takerShanghai Everything seems like a mess to me now. Though the COVID policy has been relaxed, I don’t see how it benefits me. The school is encouraging students to return home, even after my exam at the end of the month. Once there’s a positive case in our dorm, the whole building will be locked down. I have to take the exam and I have nowhere else to go. I woke up Sunday to the news that our building was going to be locked down sooner or later. Fearing I’d miss the exam, I spent an hour packing all my belongings and left the school. Now I’m staying in a hotel. I need to stay here for 20 days. It’s so expensive, and I can’t see an end to it.  Peng Jinxia, 43Internet café ownerChangde, Hunan province The policy changed so fast that not everyone can get used to it, at least not my customers. In the past three years, we’ve heard that the virus is fatal and we must do everything to protect ourselves. It won’t be easy to erase that fear. As long as people are still afraid of getting infected, people won’t come to my internet café like they did before the pandemic. My internet café can hold over 140 people at a time, and it used to be the most popular venue in town. But now we’re lucky if we have some 30 customers. We are losing them. When’s the end? When will my customers come back again? Will they come back?

"China Further Eases COVID Curbs, Allows Home Isolation for Mild Cases","For the first time, the country is signaling a broader opening up after three years of mass testing and strict lockdowns.",2022-12-07,"China’s top health authority on Wednesday said the country will allow those infected with the coronavirus with mild or no symptoms to isolate at home and will avert from long-term lockdowns to curb outbreaks, as the country eases some of its strictest COVID policies three years into the pandemic. People meeting certain conditions for home isolation will receive two consecutive PCR tests on the sixth and seventh day of isolation before it is determined whether they can be released, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, areas deemed “high-risk” — including where infected individuals live or work — with no infections for five straight days must be unsealed “promptly,” unlike before when entire apartment blocks would be locked indefinitely. While several cities have relaxed their local coronavirus restrictions, this is the first national guideline, indicating that the country is getting ready to live with the virus in the same way as the rest of the world. In the past weeks, officials and experts have repeatedly stressed that the now dominant Omicron subvariant is relatively milder than the earlier strains. The new COVID rules come just as several major cities relaxed strict pandemic control rules over the past days. Metropolises like Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Guangzhou now no longer need residents to show their PCR test results to take public transport or visit public spaces, though they’re still required for most indoor spaces such as schools, hospital visits, gyms, and restaurants. Many cities have also scrapped frequent PCR tests, with Shanghai this week saying that they would not turn health codes from green to yellow, which previously restricted access to many public places. Some cities such as Beijing have either reduced the number of kiosks for such tests or are making people bear the cost, with many complaining of longer wait times. The health authority on Wednesday also said people would be able to easily access over-the-counter medicines for coughs, colds, and fevers, which were previously partly restricted or required real-name registration. Some cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou had already relaxed requirements before the latest announcement, with people rushing to stock up on essential medicines fearing a spike in infections. Authorities are now also stressing that the elderly — who are most vulnerable to the virus — should be vaccinated, putting the onus on local governments to accelerate the drive. Currently, 25 million of those over the age of 60 are yet to be vaccinated against COVID as of late November, officials said. The relaxation of COVID policies signals that China is finally ready to open up after three years of mass testing and strict lockdowns. In November, the country cut quarantine for inbound travelers to five days at designated facilities and three days at home, while scrapping rules that temporarily banned international flights from carrying infected passengers.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011845
"After 3 Years of COVID, China’s Gen-Z Face a Tough New Reality","For young Chinese, the pandemic hasn’t just brought years of lockdowns; it has fundamentally altered their expectations for the future — and their understanding of their place in society.",2022-12-06,"2022 was the year China’s Gen-Z came of age. The first cohort of young Chinese born in the 21st century — known as the “post-’00s” generation — have now reached the legal marriage age and graduated from university. In this four-part series, Sixth Tone will explore how the post-’00s differ from earlier generations, and how they might shape China’s future. This is the second story in the series, focusing on how the post-’00s have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first story is available here. In October, Chen began to feel seriously unwell. Worried he might need emergency medical treatment, the 20-year-old student went to his tutor for help. The tutor’s response frustrated him. Rather than ask Chen how he was doing, his tutor bluntly informed him that he would need to apply for permission to leave campus due to the college’s strict virus-control rules. For Chen, the incident encapsulates life inside China’s universities during the pandemic — a period where institutions have come to be ruled by fear. “It feels like people are not very important,” says Chen, who gave only his surname to protect his privacy. “Following the rules is what’s important.” For young Chinese like Chen, the COVID-19 pandemic has meant more than just three years of lockdowns. It has often been a life-shaping event — one that has altered their view of the world and their expectations for the future. Chen is a member of China’s “post-’00s” generation — the first cohort of young Chinese born in the 21st century, whose time at university has coincided almost exactly with the coronavirus era. After growing up during an age of rapid economic growth, many “post-’00s” arrived at college full of confidence. They took it for granted that they’d find good jobs and enjoy a comfortable life after graduation. Then came COVID-19, and everything changed. Chinese universities implemented some of the country’s strictest “zero-COVID” rules, locking down again and again. Leaving campus for nights out, internships, or even trips home became challenging at the best of times — and all but impossible this year as cases rose.  Meanwhile, China’s economy has slowed sharply and white-collar jobs have dried up. By July, the country’s urban youth unemployment rate was nearly 20%. When the first class of post-’00s finished their degrees this summer, domestic media dubbed it “the hardest graduation season in history.” For many post-’00s, it has been a dizzying — and distressing — reversal of fortunes. In a July survey of post-’00s by Chinese business media outlet Yicai, nearly 85% of respondents said the pandemic had made their university lives less fulfilling than they’d expected. Over 75% said it had reduced their sense of security, while nearly 70% said it had lowered their confidence in the future. Online, this sentiment has crystallized into an often-repeated refrain: “Youth is short, and three years of it have been lost to the pandemic.” Many who expected to spend their late teens and early twenties exploring and experimenting are instead learning to deal with feelings of helplessness and anxiety. To better understand how young Chinese are coping, Sixth Tone asked six members of the post-’00s generation for their views on zero-COVID, growing up in the shadow of a pandemic, and how the past three years have changed their outlooks on life.  Gao Ling, 21, university student in Shanghai This spring, after Shanghai went into lockdown, one of Gao’s classmates tested positive for the coronavirus. Within days, she and over 100 of her fellow students were transferred to a city in the neighboring Jiangsu province for quarantine. “The quarantine was probably the worst time of my life,” Gao says. “I felt like I had been cut off from the world.”  Gao had been dealing with depression for some time before the lockdown. Although her mental state improved after a semester speaking with a senior psychology student, she experienced intense emotional swings and anxiety during the 10 days she spent in the quarantine facility. Slowly, however, she learned to control her moods. Attending online classes and meetings and working on her own projects, she even began to see the bright side of time away from campus. She now thinks she was depressed because she was “too young,” and that the experience helped her mature. Not long after China’s October National Day holiday, she was quarantined again. This time it barely fazed her. “I don’t really let the bad things make me unhappy anymore,” she says. “It’s enough to just keep on living.” Her future remains a sore spot, however. Gao believes that post-’00s have had a fundamentally different pandemic experience from older generations. The post-’80s and post-’90s “already have their own lives,” she says, while the post-’00s confined to campuses have been “pushed around.” A senior, she plans to work in human resources, the major she picked nearly four years ago. But she feels her job search has been affected by the pandemic and she has yet to receive a job offer. “Frankly, I don’t see the end of the pandemic yet,” she says. “I’m not hopeful about it. There is no despair without hope.”  Chen, 20, university student in Shanghai The past year has been a reality check for Chen. In October, he fell ill and wanted to go to the hospital for emergency treatment. Rather than ask how he was doing, his tutor bluntly informed him that he would need to apply for permission before he could leave campus — a rule instituted after Shanghai’s citywide lockdown in the spring. “It seems the whole system from top to bottom is very touchy and fearful of making a mistake,” he says.  He and his classmates live in fear of another lockdown. In October, as cases ticked back up in Shanghai, students cleared out the campus supermarket’s shelves almost instantly. “Everyone, including me, suddenly had this strong sense of looming crisis,” he says. “I felt like I was going to go back to the days when I couldn’t move for months.” As a student, Chen says he doesn’t need to worry too much about food or having a place to stay. But he’s felt the pinch of China’s “zero-COVID” policy in other ways. Chen’s father, who runs a small shop, had to pay rent and staff salaries during a separate lockdown of his hometown in the southwestern province of Guizhou. His father’s business has yet to fully recover. Before the pandemic, Chen thought that if he studied hard, he could find a stable job and live a good life. Now he’s not even sure he’ll finish school: “College was supposed to be the most important years of my youth, but I lost those years to this.”  Xie Bin, 21, content creator in Zhejiang province Xie lives alone in the eastern tech hub of Hangzhou, where he works for a new media company. He says the job, which pays him 7,000 yuan ($987) a month, wasn’t what he was hoping for, but that he took it because of “the bad environment” caused by COVID-19. “The pandemic has made people more anxious about money and its absence,” he says. If it hadn’t been for the pandemic, perhaps he might have spent the past few years expanding his personal networks by going out and meeting new people. Instead, he spends most of his time either at work or at home, in part to avoid unnecessary quarantine risks. On the other hand, “zero-COVID” does have its benefits. His relationship with his parents, who are unsupportive of his career, is strained, and the policy has occasionally promised relief. “Last year, I briefly hoped that Hangzhou would be locked down so I wouldn’t have to go home for the holidays,” he admits. Xie also says COVID-19 has brought new opportunities to his industry, as people spend more time watching short videos and surfing livestreaming platforms. He likes the work, low pay notwithstanding, and thinks he can find success, given time. But he feels uncertainty hanging over everything. “This uncertainty stems from frustration with the country, its institutions, and its policies,” he says.  Li Xiaohan, 16, high school student in Guangdong province When Li’s high school announced it was switching to remote learning, her first reaction was relief at the prospect of being able to sleep in. She even hoped the pandemic would last longer. Relaxation soon gave way to tedium, however. “I felt bored staying home all the time, and every day I wondered when I could go out again,” she says. Her attitude hardened further when she learned her parents were earning less working from home: “I changed my mind. I want it to end quickly.” The pandemic and shift to online classes have also impacted her grades. Although China has not published official data on learning outcomes during the pandemic, studies elsewhere suggest that the shift to remote learning has been rocky. Li, who spent much of the remote learning period shopping online to relieve stress, admits her scores were not “very ideal” after her school resumed in-person instruction. “Based on my exam results, I might not get into college,” she says. Nevertheless, Li is proud of the job China has done controlling COVID-19. “Everyone is working hard on this,” she says. “It’s a great demonstration of the unity of the Chinese people.”  Fu, 20, English teacher in Fujian province In the spring of 2020, Fu was a university student in the English city of Manchester. When the COVID-19 outbreak there spiraled out of control, he decided to return to the relative safety of China. Prior to the pandemic, Fu, who gave only a surname for privacy reasons, had always assumed he would complete his undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the United Kingdom before finding a finance job and settling down there. But as case counts skyrocketed, his opinion of the U.K. soured.  “Everyone was testing positive,” he recalls. “It was stranger if someone’s test came back negative.” Opposition to mask mandates ran deep, and, most important to Fu, racism against Asians was widespread. Now, Fu works as an English teacher in a small city in the southeastern province of Fujian. His salary, 3,000 yuan per month, is far less than what he might have earned in finance, but he says money feels less important since the pandemic. He has regrets — China’s COVID-19 controls kept him from seeing his grandmother before she died and the strain of going long-distance led him and his girlfriend to break up — but he’s confident he made the right decision. “The pandemic shows the difference between China and the West, and China’s system is better,” he says.  Li, 20, university student in Shanghai Ask Li what she thinks of the Shanghai lockdown, and her first response is to brush it off. “It’s all kind of forgotten now,” says Li, who gave only her surname for privacy reasons. Push a little harder, however, and it’s clear she has no shortage of thoughts on the politics of “zero-COVID.” She remembers a key moment in the spring, when one of her instructors was posting politically sensitive stories and she chose to repost them on her own accounts. “When some grassroots officials are incompetent, or they are wrong about some aspects of governance, and no one points it out, or they are afraid to point it out, that’s the real threat to social harmony,” she says. A native of the nearby city of Suzhou, Li appreciates Shanghai residents’ willingness to speak out during the lockdown, “People are starting to talk about (their experiences) in public,” she says, calling it “a very hopeful thing” and “a point of pride as a Chinese person.” Li says she originally wanted to become an academic, but now feels that the ivory tower is too insular. “Scholars’ work is rarely heard at the highest levels, and it doesn’t have much impact when posted online,” she says. “I’ll just get on with my life, get a job, or open a shop or something.” (Icons: Shijue/VCG)",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011836
China’s COVID Testing Complex Complains of Paper Profits and Real Losses,The Paper dives into the data to see who’s making bank and who’s in trouble.,2022-12-06,"Editor’s note: Mass nucleic acid testing has been central to China’s efforts in combating COVID-19 as the pandemic enters its fourth year. However, multiple cities and counties have recently changed their policies, with Chongqing suggesting residents only take nucleic acid tests when necessary and Shenzhen, Beijing, and Tianjin no longer checking test results on public transportation. Meanwhile, IPO applications by testing companies have come under intense scrutiny as they reaped much of their revenue from the pandemic. Four years into the pandemic, how are China’s COVID testing companies faring? As many companies have released their interim reports for 2022, The Paper’s data team looked into their finances and had three key findings. Increasing disparity between revenue and net profit As the pandemic enters its fourth year, the booming nucleic acid testing industry has well and truly come to an end. Newcomers are no longer guaranteed big profits as the market reaches saturation. The disparity of the companies’ profit margins has widened. The Paper looked into their interim reports for 2022 and categorized them by their total revenue and net profit. First are companies whose revenue and net profit have both continued to grow. They have dominated both the domestic and international markets to stimulate growth. There are also companies whose revenue and net profit have both dwindled. They have failed to keep up with market competition and thus have a shrinking market share. Last but not least are companies with revenue growth but a declining net profit. These players have generally turned to low-profit, high-volume sales in the hope of securing more market share.   In the first category, YHLO Biotech stands out with the highest growth rates in the first six months of 2022, with its revenue and net profit up 326% and 648% year-on-year, respectively. The company’s SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid test kits have been approved and procured by health authorities at home and abroad to generate 1.82 billion yuan ($259 million) in revenue, a whopping 3,046.6% increase compared to the same period last year. Similarly, PONY Testing, Labway, and EasyDiagnosis — companies that saw growth in both revenue and net profit — all said in their reports that routinized nucleic acid testing in China had driven up demand for their products and stimulated rapid growth of the industry. These players have all come out on top in the nucleic acid testing market, making it easier for them to stay afloat through industry consolidation. Meanwhile, companies such as BGI, Hotgen, and Lepu Medical saw both revenue and net profit drop significantly in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year. To them, the testing business is no longer as lucrative as it once was but there is still some profit to be eked out. “The growing competition in the domestic and international markets for COVID testing products has forced us to lower our prices, causing our revenue to drop compared to the same period last year,” Hotgen wrote in its interim report. As more countries enforce regulation on COVID-19 test prices and more players enter the market, competition has intensified and affected profit margins. Though the third category of companies posted a year-on-year increase in revenue, their net profit had dipped. Orient Gene attributed the decline in net profit to an aggressive price cut by the government for SARS-CoV-2 test kits during the reporting period. Given the thin profit margin, these companies hope to secure their position in the industry by selling more tests. However, they’re unable to turn a large profit despite revenue growth. Big bucks from the upstream sector But a COVID-19 test does not start or end with a simple swab. There are raw material suppliers to help make the test kits, companies that provide the tests, and laboratories that produce the test results. Who has the most lucrative business? The Paper analyzed the annual reports for 2021 of nearly 30 companies and found that the upstream companies make the most profits in the supply chain. For example, Fapon Biotech revealed in its prospectus that the gross profit margin for raw materials was as high as 96% in 2021.  The midstream segment, meanwhile, saw the widest gap in profit between the top performers and everyone else. A case in point is DaAn Gene, who reported a gross profit margin of 88% on its nucleic acid test kit in 2021. Downstream organizations saw a more moderate profit margin ranging from 45% to 65%. In recent years, Hybribio has directed its efforts toward building and operating third-party clinical laboratories. In its annual report for 2021, the company reported a 63% gross profit margin for its clinical testing services. Unsustainable cash flow But companies that see rapid growth are not immune to underlying risks. Companies do not receive payments immediately after providing testing services, so selling on credit has become a common practice in the industry. This in turn significantly increases the risks of bad debt. Illustrated below are the accounts receivable — the amount customers owe the company — of the testing companies recorded at the end of 2021 and mid-2022. For example, Labway wrote in its interim report that its accounts receivable reached 66% as it waited longer for the payment for the mass testing services it provided.   Overdue payments have put these companies’ cash flow positions under serious strain. PONY Testing, BGI, Labway, Dian Diagnostics Group and many other companies reported a negative cash flow for the first half of 2022. This points to trouble chasing down debts and balancing operation costs and earnings. The disruption in cash flow prompted companies to resort to financing to stay afloat. However, the intensifying competition in the COVID-19 testing industry only means that a strong cash flow will be key to their survival.

China to Boost COVID Vaccination for the Elderly Amid Outbreak,"As infections spike, the country plans to protect the most vulnerable demographic.",2022-11-30,"China plans to accelerate its COVID-19 vaccination drive among the vulnerable older population, especially those over the age of 80, in an effort to ramp up the lagging inoculation progress amid record-high infections since the pandemic started. The time interval for older individuals to receive booster doses has also been reduced from six to three months, according to the plan released Tuesday by the epidemic prevention arm of the State Council, or China’s Cabinet. The document listed six domestically manufactured vaccine combinations, including the inhaled and recombinant protein vaccines, as booster shots. “People aged 60 and above are identified as high-risk groups for developing severe symptoms, while the risks are even higher for those over 80 years old,” Guo Yanhong, a senior official at the National Health Commission, said during a press conference Tuesday. While seniors accounted for 65% of all severe COVID cases in China, more than half of them were unvaccinated, according to official data published in March. The central authorities have now ordered local governments to make inoculation more convenient and accessible for older people, while boosting vaccination efforts in nursing homes, activity centers, and other public venues. Though China has vaccinated the vast majority of its people, the country has fallen short of getting the shots into the arms of its older population. As of Wednesday, around 86% of those aged 60 and above had received a two-dose regimen, and 66% of those over 80 had completed the same course. The vaccination campaign, especially for booster doses, has slowed in the past months. While the number of over-60s getting a booster shot edged from 146.6 million to 181.5 million between April and November, the figure for over-80s rose marginally from 38% to 40% from July to November, according to the National Health Commission. Though experts and officials have made reassurances that vaccinations could prevent the elderly from serious illness after being infected with COVID, many remain skeptical amid claims of possible adverse reactions. Experts have rejected posts made online claiming that the vaccines could cause health risks such as leukemia and diabetes. Meanwhile, the vaccination drive has been overshadowed by local coronavirus outbreaks, with many places struggling to contain the surges, domestic media reported. China has seen an uptick of COVID-19 cases since October, with cases reaching a pandemic high last week. China began to more strongly push for the elderly to get vaccinated against COVID after an Omicron wave in Hong Kong earlier this year showed the risk posed to the unvaccinated older population. The State Council’s move on Tuesday came just weeks after the country revised its anti-COVID policy, promising to ease curbs, though many places are still under lockdowns or other restrictions amid recent cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011783
Vegetable Sales Tumble Amid COVID Curbs in China’s Agriculture Hub,"Farmers in Henan province say their produce is going to waste, while consumer prices have shot up.",2022-11-25,"After the real estate malaise and crippled iPhone production, China’s central province of Henan is facing another looming crisis due to the pandemic restrictions — vegetable waste. Nearly 50 counties in the province have witnessed difficulties in selling their fresh produce, with farmers complaining that consistent lockdowns and other excessive curbs have hobbled procurement and strained transportation and logistics, domestic media reported Thursday. Known as the “granary of China,” the agriculture hub accounts for around one-tenth of the overall national vegetable production. The issue came into the spotlight after the town of Zhifang reported around 191 million kilograms of cabbage, 3.5 million kilograms of scallions, and other products had been left in farms as they were unable to reach consumers. In a spreadsheet that was widely circulated online, nearly 500 farmers said they were facing difficulties in selling their vegetables, with some even claiming to offer them for free if buyers bore the labor costs. “The outbreaks have brought sales to a halt over the past month and put our plans out of whack,” a farmer in the city of Shangqiu told Sixth Tone, adding that the two-week lockdown in his village in October has discouraged potential franchisers and retailers from visiting. “Many business partners are also reluctant to come, mentioning risks of infections amid the flare-ups,” another farmer in the city of Luoyang said. Both the farmers asked to remain anonymous fearing retaliation from local authorities. In the wake of the farmers’ plight, the provincial government last week vowed to tackle the crisis, asking local officials to offer green channels for transportation and prohibiting excessive COVID curbs. But a viral video shared by a Douyin user claiming to be a supermarket owner about his failure to get products reveals the arduous process of requesting certificates and permits from local officials before entering a village. Disruptions to food supply have worried industrial insiders, as damage to local farmers is likely to affect the supply chain and ultimately market prices. Vegetable prices at Xinfadi, Beijing’s biggest food wholesale market to which Henan is one of the major suppliers, logged a monthly increase of 9% in early November, while the purchasing prices for some vegetables from the farm have plummeted, according to its website. The Shangqiu farmer said that sales have gradually picked up after local authorities relaxed the restrictions, though he doesn’t expect to make any profits this year. Meanwhile, the farmer from Luoyang said that he hadn’t been able to sell anything in the past few days after his town went into a quasi-lockdown following an infection. “There’s nothing I can do other than watch them rot (if the situation persists),” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011749
"Fearing Lockdown, Beijing’s Delivery Workers Camp Outside","A Meituan delivery driver’s plea for help has gone viral, prompting his employer to arrange accommodation.",2022-11-23,"Food delivery drivers in Beijing have said they have been living on the streets to continue working and earning after their residential buildings were locked down amid a surge in coronavirus infections. In a desperate plea for help, a gig worker surnamed Zhang wrote that he and 15 other drivers were looking for affordable accommodation after their buildings were sealed Sunday. Zhang said the group feared not being able to work if they returned to their apartments, adding that they had been braving the plummeting temperatures and finding shelter wherever they could. “Even these places are becoming inaccessible for us because people are working from home and restaurants are gradually halting dine-in services,” Zhang wrote in Tuesday’s post, along with a QR code to his WeChat account. “We can’t afford pricey hotels … We would appreciate it if someone could connect us with rental homes that cost around 50 yuan ($7) per person per day.” The post, which has since gone viral on social media platforms, underscores the plight of the country’s gig workers, who are willing to go to extra lengths to protect their incomes at a time when their jobs have been continuously disrupted by the virus control measures. Beijing is currently experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, along with several major cities, including Guangzhou in the south and Zhengzhou in central China. The capital has tightened restrictions, with some districts shutting schools, restaurants, and other public spaces to curb infections. Delivery workers are an integral part of China’s gig economy and fuel the multi-billion dollar industry. But they’re often exploited and poorly paid, despite companies promising to improve their working conditions. During Shanghai’s spring lockdown, the delivery workers proved to be a crucial lifeline in catering to the needs of the city’s 25 million residents. Fearing they would be unable to work if they lived in their sealed residential compounds, many of them camped out on the streets and relied on free takeouts while they fed hungry city dwellers. Zhang said he and his coworkers, hired by food delivery platform Meituan, had slept in delivery stations, office buildings, and restaurants over the past few days. “We insist on doing a (PCR) test every day,” he wrote in the viral post. “But we don’t want to be locked down or lose our only source of income.” On Wednesday, a Meituan spokeswoman told Sixth Tone that the company had arranged hotels for Zhang and others, and promised to cover their expenses. The platform also plans to help other drivers facing similar problems. Zhang confirmed on his WeChat profile that their employer had arranged accommodation for the group. He, however, didn’t respond to Sixth Tone’s interview request.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011728
"Amid Outbreak, Guangzhou Workers Wait and Wonder",Workers in Guangzhou’s urban villages face days living on the streets as their residences restrict entry.,2022-11-22,"This article was originally published by The World of Chinese. It has been republished here with permission. Zhang Yanbing had been living in a rented apartment in Lujiang, Guangzhou, and going to work in nearby textile factories for five years. In the last week, however, he has spent five days sleeping on a cardboard box near a subway station, with only a quilt distributed by volunteers for shelter and food and water provided by local officials. The 40-year-old garment worker from Sichuan province is just one of the thousands working and living in the “urban villages” of Haizhu District, which are administered as villages but have been encompassed by Guangzhou’s urban sprawl. In Haizhu, these urban villages are major centers of textile production employing thousands of workers, mostly migrants from other provinces and the outlying countryside. In recent weeks, they have been closed off or placed under strict pandemic management due to rising COVID-19 cases in the city, leaving people like Zhang stranded outside with nowhere to stay after leaving centralized quarantine.  Lujiang is one of the most important areas for the textile industry in the region. Since 1988, a vast cloth market emerged around nearby Sun Yat-sen University which has become a supply chain hub that connects with 80 percent of the textile and garment factories in the Pearl River Delta. According to a 2018 article written by Wang Xianqing, president of the Guangdong Commercial Economics Society, there are more than 30,000 garment factories, workshops, and stores in the area, employing over 300,000 people. According to Chinese media outlet Caixin, there are around 5,200 garment factories and a highly dense population of over 100,000 residents in Lujiang village and Kangle village, which occupy just one square kilometer. Urban villages like Lujiang and Kangle in the Haizhu district have also become the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak in Guangzhou since October 22. According to official statistics, by Nov. 15, among 6,296 new infections in Guangzhou, 96 percent of them were found in Haizhu District, mostly concentrated in the two villages. As infections surged, Haizhu district underwent lockdown for a week from Nov. 5 and the majority of the district, including these urban villages, remains sealed today. Since Oct. 30, the Haizhu district government has been transferring residents in urban villages to quarantine facilities in other districts and cities. According to data released by the government on Nov. 17, 95,300 residents in the district have been transferred so far. But once their quarantine ends, many residents like Zhang have been blocked from re-entering their locked-down homes and villages, and face either returning to their hometowns, where they potentially face more long quarantines and no employment, or waiting it out on the streets in the hope they will be allowed back into their apartments soon.  Zhang tried to return to Lujiang village on Nov. 12, after being transferred to and put into 10 days of quarantine in a hotel in Qingyuan (a city in the northern part of Guangdong, 100 kilometers from Guangzhou). But when he arrived in Lujiang, he found the entrances to the village barred. His landlord in the village told him that there would be a temporary shelter for tenants like him, organized by the local government, but this never materialized. All the hotels in the district are closed and residential compounds sealed, according to Zhang, making it difficult for him to rent accommodations. Zhang tells TWOC that a friend offered to let him stay in his apartment temporarily. He walked over 10 kilometers to the friend’s apartment on Nov. 13, as public transportation in Haizhu was completely shut down from Nov. 5 and only partly resumed by Nov. 14. But his friend’s landlord also refused to let Zhang stay out of fear he might be infected or cause them to be locked down themselves. He spent the next five days living on the street until, on Thursday, he found another friend to take him in.  Zhang, who used to earn from 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($1,000 to $1,400) a month working 14-hour shifts in the textile factories, has had no income for 20 days since the factories shut and he was transferred. “If the lockdown could be lifted in the next few days, I could leave with a green health code and find work in other districts or cities,” Zhang tells TWOC. But he has heard that the digital health codes needed to enter public spaces turn from green (indicating no risk) to red (which bars a person from entering any public area) when one leaves Haizhu District. Many migrant workers who reside in Guangzhou’s urban villages have instead been encouraged to leave the metropolis and return to their hometowns. One recent notice from the village committees of Lujiang and Kangle blamed the struggle to control the pandemic on out-of-date infrastructure, poor sanitation, and dense population in the neighborhood, and stated residents who finished their quarantine should return to their hometowns or find alternative living arrangements until the outbreak is under control. But many wish to stay. In an underpass around 1.5 kilometers away from the metro station Zhang lived outside, a 38-year-old garment workshop owner surnamed Han has been living with his wife and 18-year-old daughter since Nov. 14. Han and his family were brought to Zhaoqing (a city 150 kilometers west of Guangzhou) for hotel quarantine on Nov. 5. After they were released, they chose to return to the apartment they rent in the urban village. But, like Zhang, when they arrived, they were stopped by roadblocks at Lujiang village’s entrance. Han recalls that people guarding there told him that only those whose testing result had turned negative were allowed to enter, despite him having a negative test. “They said, ‘What if you enter and get infected? Wouldn’t our efforts to transfer you out and put you in quarantine be in vain?’” Han recalls. They also tell Han and other residents that it would take two to three months before they could re-enter the village and they’d better return to their hometown. Han’s landlord, who Han says is conveying messages from their neighborhood committee, also suggests him to return to his hometown or find his relatives or friends for help.  Han doesn’t want to return to his hometown, nearly 1,500 kilometers away in Luoyang, Henan province. He tells TWOC that his two younger daughters have been studying in elementary school back in Luoyang, and he is afraid he will affect their school attendance if he returns. More importantly, if Han returns, his newly built business will come to a definite end. After working as a garment worker in Guangzhou for 11 years, Han managed to set up his own apparel factory last year, and is far from breaking even on this new venture still. Before his workshop ceased operating on Oct. 22 due to the outbreak, he still had orders and outstanding payments from his clients. In addition, he needs to pay rent for his factory and workers’ dormitories, which adds up to over 10,000 yuan per month in total. His seven employees have all either returned home, or were infected and are still quarantined in makeshift hospitals.  Han estimates that if he returns to Luoyang and comes back here two to three months later, “It’s all doomed. Even if all the equipment in my factory is sold, it may not be enough to cover the three months’ rent.” He is not afraid of the infection risk in the urban village and believes it’s much safer to live in his apartment than on the street. He tries to contact his neighborhood committee for help, but says his phone calls have never been answered. “They are all trying to persuade us to go back to our hometown. But you know, people who can figure a way out of this (situation) have already made their way home. Only those who don’t have solutions choose to stay,” he adds. As reported by Chinese media, many garment factory owners in the areas are faced with similar problems as Han, with production (and thus, revenue) halted due to the lockdown. According to a professional working in the industry, who did not want to be named, 90 percent of the city’s wholesale garment markets have suspended operations, as factories stop making clothes. They also worry that the waves of workers leaving may not return to the city after restrictions are lifted. The weather in Guangzhou remains warm and humid, but living with no fixed abode is still traumatic. Han and his family got some food, water, and a quilt from some of the volunteers and government officials, but he says that there are too many mosquitoes, which makes it unbearable to live outdoors. Zhu Fuhua, a 50-something garment worker from Hunan province, is marooned outside a closed store near Lujiang village with his wife. He tells TWOC that he didn’t sleep for five or six nights due to pesky mosquitoes, only managing to doze off for short naps when he was exhausted. Zhu tried to return to Lujiang on Nov. 11 after a 10-day quarantine in the city’s Baiyun district, but was stuck outside. Then his health code turned red, so most shops in the city refused to let him enter to buy food, and he cannot even board a train to go back to Hunan.  Zhu estimates TWOC there are around 150 to 200 others marooned outside the village in the area where he has been staying. In the last two days, volunteers brought him a tent, which at least keeps away the worst of the mosquitoes, he says. Local government and volunteers have tried to address the situation. On Nov. 12, the Haizhu District government opened a temporary shelter with 375 beds for delivery workers who have no place to stay in the district. However, a plan to set up 15,000 beds in 50 schools for urban village residents after their released from quarantine was canceled after fierce opposition from local parents of schoolchildren. One businessman from Hubei is reported to have offered his billiard hall to accommodate around 100 residents in the district.  Hundreds of volunteers in Guangzhou have also mobilized to help find and deliver food and necessities for those marooned outside the urban villages, providing much needed supplies to people like Zhang, Han, and Zhu. On Nov. 18, Han finally also found a friend willing to take him in. But so far, a lot more urban village workers and residents, like Zhu, are still living under uncertainty. On Nov. 16, the Haizhu district government officially announced that the lockdown of the sealed areas in the district would be extended three more days until Nov. 19, while the number of confirmed cases reached nearly 9,000 in a single day in the city, a new peak since the pandemic outbreak. No one knows how long the lockdown will last, but Han still wants to stay in Guangzhou against all odds. “If they insist on kicking us out, there is nothing we can do but go home. But as long as there is a possibility, we want to stay,” he says, “This is the only business our family has. It would be heartbreaking to lose it.” Reported by Chen Shihuan.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011715
China’s Hottest Art Show Is in the Middle of Nowhere. Literally.,"After being quarantined in a ‘fangcang’ hospital, artist Meng Lichao and two friends decided to put on a show. Don’t bother trying to get a ticket though — you have to you know someone with COVID.",2022-11-17,"If you hold a one-day art exhibition in a fangcang hospital in the middle of nowhere, and no one can get in to see it, does it make a sound? For artist Meng Lichao, the answer appears to be yes. After being identified as a “close contact” of a COVID-19 case, he was sent to a temporary shelter hospital, or fangcang, on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Deyang on Nov. 8. Once there, Meng decided to make the hospital the site of his next exhibition. Along with two of his friends who had been sent to the same quarantine site, the 31-year-old artist and curator spent three days preparing. Together they produced 11 works of art, ranging from drawings to photos, collages, and sound recordings. “Being put in quarantine is a common experience,” Meng told Sixth Tone in a phone interview Thursday. “We wanted to keep optimistic and handle a passive thing in a lighter, more interesting manner, while reflecting on the current state of life through art.” The three artists paid couriers to buy them pens, paper, and printed photos, which would then be delivered to their separate rooms by staff at the fangcang. They also made use of materials at the quarantine facility, such as lunch boxes and plastic bags for medical waste. Imitating the British artist Sam Cox, better known as Mr. Doodle, Meng covered every inch of his 18-square-meter plastic shed in black and white squiggles and sketches.  For another work, Meng mixed rhythmic music produced by a friend with a recording of the mechanical alarm that loudly declared, “Please note, you have entered the monitoring area,” any time there was activity in the aisle that linked quarantine rooms.   First put into use to house patients during the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan, fangcang hospitals have spread nationwide as China clings to its “dynamic zero-COVID” strategy. Often converted from large public venues or built from trailers, they are designed to house mild cases of the disease or close contacts. After being released from the quarantine Wednesday, Meng left his work behind. Given the closed nature of fangcang, the only way to see it in person is by being assigned to his old room. A curator in the central city of Zhengzhou whose art space in that city cannot open due to a separate COVID-19 outbreak, Meng said the experiment awakened him to the ways the meaning of artistic expression changes between public and private spaces. “The exhibition’s only audience will be the next group of people living in there,” Meng said. “Whether they understand art or not, we all share certain experiences that resonate with us.”  (Header image: A screenshot from ‘Amusing Ourselves to Death’ by Meng Lichao.

"China Eases COVID Curbs, Cuts Quarantines and Flight Bans",The country is still sticking to “zero-COVID” policy as it relaxes some of the world’s strictest virus control measures.,2022-11-11,"China has shortened quarantine times, tweaked its classification of so-called “risk areas,” and scrapped measures that punish airlines for carrying coronavirus-positive passengers in a major shift, signaling a gradual relaxation of the country’s “zero-COVID” policy. Quarantine times for international arrivals and close contacts of those infected with the coronavirus have been slashed to five days at a government-designated facility and three days at home instead of the previous seven and three days, respectively. The PCR test requirement for inbound passengers has also been adjusted — they’re now required to have one test 48 hours before boarding instead of two. The changes are part of 20 new revised COVID control measures announced by the State Council’s epidemic prevention team on Friday. Another major change in the new guidelines includes ending the “circuit breaker” policy that temporarily suspended airlines from operating flights based on the number of passengers who test positive for the coronavirus after arriving in China. Even as the country has added more flights in recent months and cut quarantine time for inbound travelers since its borders were virtually shut in March 2020, the flights are still far less in number and extremely costly. Half an hour after the announcement, the number of bookings for China-bound flight tickets doubled compared with the day before, while searches for international flights surged by 200%, according to online travel platform Trip.com Group. Ticket prices, however, remained unchanged. Domestically, the country will no longer categorize areas as “middle-risk” and instead classify them as only “high-risk” or “low-risk.” While high-risk areas constitute housing units where infected individuals live, work, or may have visited, the county as a whole will be labeled as low-risk. High-risk areas will be downgraded to low-risk if no new infections are detected for five consecutive days. Authorities have also scrapped quarantine measures for those deemed as secondary contacts of COVID-positive individuals, and prohibited arbitrary testing expansion for those living in uninfected areas. This comes as several local governments have already ended free testing for its residents, asking them to foot the bill amid mounting costs. Meanwhile, authorities urged to strengthen vaccination efforts and promote booster shots, especially among older groups. While the country has vaccinated 92% of its population, getting the shots in the arms of its aging population has proved to be a challenge. While Friday’s new measures appear relatively lenient, health officials said last week that the country still plans to stick with its “zero-COVID” policy, but with a more “targeted approach.” China logged 10,535 local coronavirus cases on Thursday, as several places in Guangdong and Henan provinces, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are either under full or partial lockdowns.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011639
Chinese City Slammed for Turning Heritage Site Into COVID Shelter,"A 58-year-old historic and cultural center is being transformed to accommodate 10,000 people infected with the coronavirus.",2022-11-10,"The central city of Zhengzhou has attracted unwanted attention several times this year — from hitting depositors of embattled rural banks with red health codes to the chaotic COVID-19 restrictions at the city’s iPhone factory. Now, the capital of Henan province is once again sparking public anger, this time for converting a historical building into a shelter hospital, or fangcang, for coronavirus patients. The city’s epidemic control authorities are turning the main building of the Zhengzhou No.2 Grinding Wheel Factory, categorized as a national heritage site, into an “medical inspection center,” said an official announcement dated Nov. 4 that has since gone viral. The hospital project in the 58-year-old building, which is scheduled to start operating early next month, plans to accommodate 10,000 patients upon completion.  The No.2 Grinding Wheel Factory was once the largest such factory in Asia. Supported financially and technically by East Germany during China’s First Five-Year Plan between 1953 and 1957, the complex incorporates a Bauhaus design characterized by oversized windows, large spaces bathed in natural light, and distinctive saw-tooth roofs. The site was included in China’s list of Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 2019. It was also planned to rival Beijing’s 798 Art Zone as a cultural and art hub. Many online have expressed concern about the potential damage that the medical facility could cause to the historical building, with some questioning if city authorities had received permission from relevant departments before starting the project. One of the pictures taken inside the facility shows that the mottled ceiling and pillars, which show the old age of the building, have been painted white.  “I’m afraid this is just the beginning,” one user wrote on microblogging platform Weibo. “When transforming the country’s historical and cultural legacies into fangcang can somehow be ‘legalized,’ I can’t imagine what will happen to those legacies that are protected at city or county levels,” said a Weibo user. “Why not renovate the Forbidden City?” mocked another user when commenting on the news. An anonymous official confirmed the project to domestic media outlet Dingduan on Wednesday, but noted that the makeshift hospital was unlikely to damage the main building. The official said they were only “using unused space instead of renovating the building.” Zhengzhou has been battling to contain a fresh COVID wave, with the city reporting 1,346 infections for Wednesday. The virus flare-up has led to partial lockdowns, hampering operations in the world’s largest iPhone assembly plant. (",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011627
Confusion Reigns as Marathon Races (Kind of) Return to China,"A string of Chinese marathon and trail races were finally due to make a long-delayed return this month. Then, the country’s virus prevention measures tightened up once again.",2022-11-08,"One of China’s most popular ultramarathon races returned under unusual circumstances last weekend, as a last-minute tightening of local virus control rules led to three-quarters of the runners being unable to take part. The sudden rule change followed the cancellation of several other major races amid a flare-up in coronavirus infections — underlining once again how China’s sports industry faces a rocky road to recovery as the country doubles down on its strict “zero-COVID” policy. The race — Tsaigu Tangsi — had been hotly anticipated among Chinese athletes, as it was one of the first major ultramarathon events to be held in the country since 21 runners tragically lost their lives during a race in northwest China’s Gansu province two years ago. Tsaigu Tangsi is a hugely popular event that sees athletes run through bamboo forests and tea plantations near the historic city of Linhai, in east China’s Zhejiang province. Around 4,000 people were due to take part in the race, which includes distances of 26, 55, 85, and 115 kilometers.  But a few days ahead of the race, local authorities announced that only people who had been in Zhejiang province since Nov. 1 would be allowed to compete. That left around 3,000 of the 4,000 entrants unable to participate, according to the event organizers.  The race organizers did not elaborate on the decision or why it had been taken. “These were the COVID prevention and control requirements of Zhejiang province. We strictly adhered to all the COVID prevention and control policies,” said Xue Yingchun, the event’s owner and director. Sixth Tone was unable to reach the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention for comment. For Chinese athletes, it was just the latest disruption after a chaotic few years. Almost all major running events were canceled during the first 10 months of 2022, as China struggled to contain the highly infectious Omicron variant. A string of races were scheduled to be held in November, but local COVID rules have continued to make things difficult. The cities of Wuxi, Changchun, Baoding, Suzhou, and Shijiazhuang have all canceled marathon events in recent weeks. The Beijing Marathon went ahead on Nov. 6, but out-of-towners were barred from signing up. “According to my estimates, originally there were five marathons (scheduled) on Nov. 5, but only one was held,” said Du Mingrui, whose company, Beijing Runner Sports, supplies apparel and other goods for marathons in China. “Out of 17 marathons on Nov. 6, only five were held.” Ultramarathon and trail runners have suffered from even more disruption. China’s sports authorities prohibited all trail and ultramarathon events following the disaster in Gansu in May 2020. The ban was lifted earlier this year, but before Tsaigu Tangsi only a handful of events had been held. Several races opened for registration only to be canceled at the last minute. Before the pandemic, trail running races were exploding in popularity in China, with local authorities — keen to boost tourism — investing generously in events and offering lucrative prize money. Hundreds of events took place nationwide in 2019, many of them attracting thousands of entrants. Chinese trail runners were also beginning to challenge the world’s elite athletes, and claim podium places in the sport’s most prestigious events. Yao Miao, from southwest China’s Guizhou province, even reached the top of the female world rankings. At Tsaigu Tangsi, she dominated the blue-ribbon 115 km category.  However, China’s ultramarathon runners have struggled to maintain their training during the pandemic. Many have been caught up in citywide lockdowns, while travel restrictions have often made going to the mountains to train impossible. At Tsaigu Tangsi, the runners who managed to take part were just happy to be competing again at home. Xiang Fuzhao, a professional runner who finished second in the women’s 115 km division, had to travel abroad to race during the past two years, meaning she had to quarantine each time she returned to China. “For many people it was very hard to come to the race, because the demands of the COVID controls are very high,” Xiang said. “My next race is not yet decided, because there is so much uncertainty.” Zhao Fan, a runner from Beijing who works in the trail running industry, said that many runners at Tsaigu Tangsi didn’t believe they’d be able to run the race until they were standing on the starting line — such was the atmosphere of uncertainty. “The feeling at the race was a mixture of familiar and unfamiliar,” Zhao said. “It had been so long without races that we’d even forgotten how to prepare our equipment.”  After two years of lockdowns and race cancellations, for many runners the race was a reunion. “On the start line we saw friends we had not seen for two years. We were all very excited,” said Zhao. “Tsaigu Tangsi is famous for its atmosphere, the starting ceremony has professional lighting and a rock band.” Despite the much-reduced attendance, the atmosphere on the day in Linhai was celebratory. The city’s economy is highly reliant on tourism, and Tsaigu Tangsi has a lot of support from local residents and officials, according to Zhao. Thousands of people showed up to cheer on the runners. “Tsaigu Tangsi has an atmosphere like no other race,” said Zheng Wenrong, a professional runner from southwest China’s Yunnan province. “Both on the race course and at the finish, you hear the roar of people cheering.” But now, the finishers at Tsaigu Tangsi will have to face the reality of yet more uncertainty, Zhao said. “Everyone is asking: ‘What is your next race? What have you registered for?’” said Zhao. “But nobody can tell what will happen. Everything now is uncertain.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011596
"A Woman Dies in China’s COVID Lockdown, Again",The death of a 55-year-old woman in Hohhot has raised questions over strict virus control measures and their impact on mental health.,2022-11-07,"A woman’s death from an apparent suicide in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region during a COVID-19 lockdown has once again sparked public anger, as local authorities on Sunday blamed the tragedy on a delayed emergency response and the negligence of community workers. The 55-year-old woman reportedly jumped from the 12th floor of her apartment building in the city of Hohhot on Friday evening, according to media reports. A resident said that neighbors found out about the woman after her 29-year-old daughter sent frantic messages in a WeChat group chat pleading for her door that had been “welded shut for a month” to be opened. The residential community was categorized as “high risk” after two coronavirus cases were detected on Oct. 26, with another infection reported Wednesday. Hohhot has been struggling to stamp out the latest wave of the COVID outbreak since late September, with the city logging 55 local infections Sunday. On Sunday, authorities in Hohhot said in an investigation report that the building’s door wasn’t locked, but the residential complex was fenced and guarded by community workers to prevent people from entering and leaving. The women’s death is another in a series of tragedies, as local governments go to great lengths to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Authorities mostly lock down buildings where infected individuals live or may have visited, and in some cases move them to quarantine centers in the same city and sometimes elsewhere. Earlier this month, a 3-year-old in the northwestern city of Lanzhou died due to carbon monoxide poisoning and a delayed emergency response amid a COVID lockdown. Local authorities said that they would punish those who had delayed the dispatching of emergency services. In Hohhot, two ambulances arrived about 30 minutes after neighbors called and announced the women’s death, according to media reports. In a press conference Sunday, Hohhot authorities blamed the tragedy on the delayed response of emergency services. Officials stressed that people weren’t allowed to lock doors in residential buildings and that emergency exits must be kept open at all times. The official investigation report indicated that the deceased woman was diagnosed with anxiety disorders in 2019 and that there might have been an argument minutes prior to the incident, without giving any details. The woman’s daughter had contacted a community worker Friday morning, informing that her mother was experiencing a mental breakdown, according to the report. She had then asked them to call an ambulance 30 minutes before she jumped out of the window. The lockdowns in China have led to a rise in mental health issues, with one counselor saying “Shanghai was in the ‘psychological emergency’ stage” in April, when the city was shut down to contain COVID cases. An editorial in the British medical journal The Lancet said in June that the human cost of lockdowns will have a long-term impact, with them “adversely affecting China’s culture and economy for years to come.” Meanwhile, on Monday, a WeChat account affiliated with Hohhot Internet Culture Association published an article instead scolding the dead woman, saying that her death betrays filial piety and that “no tribulation should be the reason to give up on life.” The article was soon deleted.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011588
A 3-Year-Old’s Death During Lanzhou Lockdown Spurs Investigation,Questions arise over the delayed response of first responders and the role of community workers amid COVID-19 restrictions.,2022-11-04,"A three-year-old’s death in the northwestern city of Lanzhou has once again triggered outrage on the delays and complications in accessing health care services during COVID-19 lockdowns, as local authorities opened an investigation Thursday. The child died following a delayed response by emergency and community workers who had blocked the exit of a residential building under a COVID-19 lockdown, which impeded his father trying to rush him to a hospital, domestic media Caixin reported Wednesday. The father, surnamed Tuo, is said to have called ambulance services and the police to seek help at least nine times in less than an hour after finding his wife and son unconscious in the kitchen, but was unable to get an urgent response. Tuo then smashed the lockdown barriers while holding his son, who was still breathing by then, before hailing a cab, according to Caixin. However, the child died after reaching the hospital, which was a 10-minute drive from their apartment. Local police said Tuesday that the three-year-old died from carbon monoxide poisoning, while Tuo’s wife had been hospitalized and later discharged. The tragedy unleashed an outpouring of grief and outrage online, with many once again underscoring the lack of access to medical services during the relentless lockdowns. Similar incidents resulting in deaths due to delayed treatments and hospitals refusing patients because of COVID protocols in cities such as Xi’an and Shanghai have prompted authorities to do better, though it has not stopped such incidents from occurring again. “(Without any hindrances) he could have arrived at any nearby hospital in five minutes, but he couldn’t leave the alley for three hours,” one user wrote on microblogging platform Weibo. In a detailed statement about the incident, the city’s epidemic prevention department on Thursday said that the emergency dispatch center had missed Tuo’s first three phone calls due to the call “not ringing long enough.” When the call did go through, the emergency worker told Tuo that they needed to further coordinate due to COVID risks and assigned doctors for a virtual consultation instead of sending an ambulance. Two social workers were also said to have fallen short of assisting Tuo when his relative informed them of their situation, the statement noted. “We will learn some painful lessons from this accident and punish units and officials who lacked emergency response capabilities and had rigid working styles,” Thursday’s statement said, though there were no specifics about the punishments. China requires emergency centers to “rapidly” dispatch ambulances and medical care workers after receiving requests, and prohibits them from refusing or delaying the service. Large parts of Lanzhou have been under lockdown since early October amid a COVID flare-up. The city logged 63 local coronavirus cases Thursday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011578
China’s Local Governments Are Ending Free COVID Tests,A public affairs commentator has labeled the move as a new form of tax on people.,2022-11-03,"Several cities and counties in China have now decided to pass on the cost of COVID-19 tests to individuals after providing free but relentless tests over the past few months to curb local outbreaks. Epidemic prevention departments in at least seven places, including Longnan in Gansu province, Guiyang in Guizhou province, Yueyang in Hunan province, Yibin in Sichuan province, and Huizhou in Guangdong province, have been charging for PCR tests and asking people to test voluntarily since November, domestic media outlet Yicai reported Wednesday. But there were exceptions in some places, where free testing would still be offered to those working in at-risk jobs, such as health care and public transportation workers. Frequent COVID-19 testing is an integral part of China’s “zero-COVID” strategy to stamp out outbreaks and is linked to the color-coded health app that governs the mobility of people. Nearly everyone in China is required to test as frequently as 72 hours as they are required for access to many places and transportation. While individual tests typically costs 16 yuan ($2), pooled samplings are priced as little as 3 yuan in some places, according to Yicai. As the news of some local governments ending free tests spread on social media, many users complained that it would add additional queuing times and longer waiting times for payments to process. One photo on microblogging site Weibo showed that the testing kiosk only accepted digital payments, and users asked how older residents without access to smartphones would pay. ​​​“We understand that mass testing increases the financial burden on the government … but the announcement reads like that it’s our decision to take a COVID-19 test or not. How is it ‘voluntary’ when I can’t go anywhere without a PCR negative result?” said a user named Lu Yao on Weibo. “The staff at a testing booth have to check the payment, scan the nucleic acid code, and then do the swab. No wonder the line is getting longer,” said another user. Xu Shaolin, a public affairs commentator, attributed the move of some local governments to financial concerns. Authorities have erected kiosks across the country in recent months and deployed thousands of personnel in hazmat suits for testing, straining state coffers. “If the local government requires nucleic acid tests to enter a public place and yet people have to take them at their own expense, then it’s a new type of tax in disguise — the nucleic acid tax,” he wrote on Weibo, referring to the widely used term for PCR tests in China. “Digging into the pocket of regular people won’t be popular.” However, some analysts have speculated that the recent announcements from local governments, as well as viral unverified posts about a “conditional reopening plan,” could signal that China is gradually shifting from its rigorous mass testing and lockdowns to curb and prevent COVID outbreaks. Some media outlets even suggested that certain transport facilities no longer required mandatory negative PCR test results for boarding trains and planes. A hotline employee at Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the eastern Anhui province told Sixth Tone on Thursday that the airport currently didn’t require passengers to show their COVID test result, though airlines may require them. Train stations in Zhanjiang in Guangdong province and Guilin in Guangxi province also reportedly had similar announcements on WeChat, according to Yicai, but the notices were unavailable on their respective accounts Thursday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011568
Authorities Intervene to Curb COVID Chaos at Foxconn Factory,Hundreds of workers in Zhengzhou were seen fleeing their workplace on foot and accused the company of handling the coronavirus outbreak poorly.,2022-10-31,"A day after hundreds of workers at the factory of Apple’s major supplier in central China’s Henan province fled to their hometowns on foot amid a COVID-19 outbreak, local authorities stepped up to set up emergency plans to contain the chaos Sunday. Authorities said they have cooperated with Taiwan-headquartered Foxconn to arrange personnel and vehicles to transport workers willing to return home by following proper procedures, according to a statement from the epidemic prevention office in Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, which oversees the factory. “For those wanting to return home, the enterprise should fully respect their wishes and sufficiently communicate with them based on voluntary principles,” the notice said, urging Foxconn to strengthen accommodation, testing, and other care services for those staying in the factory. Workers in Foxconn’s mega-factory, which employs some 200,000 people, started fleeing the manufacturing complex Saturday, as COVID-19 lockdown measures in the world’s largest iPhone assembly plant left many grappling with inadequate living conditions. Many workers have accused the company of falling short on quarantining infected workers and securing food and medicines for them. Videos circulating on social media over the weekend showed people jumping off fenced walls and hundreds walking on the highway dragging suitcases to cities and counties dozens of kilometers away. Posts revealing the shortage of food and other necessities in Foxconn’s factory started emerging on social media platforms last week in an echo of similar situations in the cities of Xining and Guiyang recently. Lin Xiang, a Foxconn worker who used a pseudonym for fear of retaliation, told Sixth Tone that he has witnessed several infections in the dormitories, but he was asked to continue working amid the outbreak. “They only send those testing positive to quarantine while those deemed close contacts have to continue working,” he said, which is in contrast to China’s COVID policies that isolate all primary and secondary contacts. Foxconn confirmed the infections last week and said production remained “relatively stable,” without disclosing the number of cases, while authorities on Sunday said that the situation is “controllable overall, with no severe cases.” In three letters to workers, which a government service platform published Sunday, the company said it will guarantee the safety and rights of workers who want to stay and arrange transportation for those willing to leave. Foxconn’s hotline for employees declined to comment when reached by Sixth Tone on Monday, referring to the company’s media department, which was unreachable by publication time. The chaos at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory, which accounts for around half of the iPhone’s global manufacturing, comes just ahead of the holiday season when sales usually pick up. More than 10% of global iPhone production capacity is currently affected by the incident, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, analyst at financial service TF International Securities. Others suggest it may slash the company’s November iPhone shipment by up to 30%. “This incident has not changed the current iPhone supply chain shipment forecast,” Kuo said on Twitter. “It’s expected that Foxconn’s production capacity will gradually improve within a few weeks … However, suppliers in China must learn to improve closed-loop production efficiency in response to the zero-Covid policy.” Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million people, reported 40 coronavirus cases for Sunday, up from 19 cases on Oct. 23. Local authorities attributed the uptick in cases due to the increased movement of people during the National Day holidays at the start of the month. Apart from Zhengzhou, several other regional economic hubs across China are also battling fresh COVID flare-ups, disrupting daily life and manufacturing in the northwestern cities of Xining and Urumqi, as well as Hohhot in the north. On Sunday, Shanghai Disney Resort said it was suspending operations due to COVID curbs until further notice, one day after announcing reduced operations last week and a year after a COVID-19 scare on Halloween.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011535
"Locked-Down Xining Residents Voice Their Hunger, Anger Online",A viral article has highlighted the plight of millions of people as authorities attempt to stamp out local coronavirus transmissions.,2022-10-27,"It’s an all-too-familiar story of millions of people locked down amid a local COVID-19 outbreak, as food shortages and restrictions on mobility cripple people’s lives. This time, the scene is being played out in the northwestern city of Xining where residents are once again pleading for food and other essentials on social media. The capital of Qinghai province, home to 2.5 million people, went into a snap lockdown last week. Dozens of locals said they are running out of food, with one making desperate pleas to a food courier to deliver steamed buns or cakes for their grandfather, who could only digest soft foods. Deliveries were not possible since the neighborhood was sealed and the older man died the following day. “I’m heartbroken and helpless knowing my grandfather passed away starving,” the Xining resident said in an article, a compilation of social media posts and chat logs, posted Wednesday. The article, posted by a WeMedia — or self-published — account, that tracks lockdown-related stories, has since gone viral and is still available online, unlike similar posts that usually disappear. Sixth Tone wasn’t able to independently verify the stories shared by the WeMedia account. The situation in Xining follows the pages from China’s COVID handbook to clear local outbreaks. This means mass testing and lockdowns, which has often led to food shortages, most recently in the cities of Guiyang and Urumqi. Xining was placed in an indefinite lockdown on Oct. 21 after the city recorded three COVID-19 cases. The number of local infections had surged to 75 by Wednesday, local authorities said. A screenshot of a private chat message shared in the viral article showed a worried mother in Xining saying that her daughter had only been living off half a corn cob for three days. Another resident shared on video platform Douyin that many of them failed to buy food after waiting for two hours at the supermarket during their allocated shopping time Tuesday. The resident in the Douyin video said that they were allowed to go out shopping every three days. However, they added that it was likely to increase the risk of infection, as there were crowds of people at the few stores that were open. Criticism over price gouging amid food shortages has also emerged on social media. Pictures shared in the viral WeChat article showed a cabbage, which usually costs a few yuan, being sold for 50 yuan ($7), while a cauliflower cost 23 yuan.  Responding to critics, local authorities in Xining have vowed to improve distribution, clamp down on price hikes, and gradually resume the normal operation of hospitals. A senior official attributed the food shortage to disruptions at a major agricultural product distribution center, which was at the center of the outbreak. “The food supply was affected as vegetable and fruit stores were closed to minimize infection risks and their owners were classified as medium or high-risk groups,” Chen Xiaoping, director of Xining’s Commerce Bureau, told the state-run People’s Daily. Apart from Xining, other provincial capitals such as Zhengzhou in central China’s Henan province and Lanzhou in the northwestern Gansu province are currently partially locked down amid virus flare-ups. Other cities, such as Shanghai, have resorted to targeted lockdowns, sealing buildings where coronavirus-infected individuals or their contacts live or may have visited. On Tuesday, Shanghai authorities announced that the city will offer an inhaled COVID vaccine as a booster to residents over the age of 18. Data from China’s top health authority shows that 89% of the country’s 1.4 billion people were fully vaccinated as of July 23, while 72% had been boosted.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011505
Shanghai to Offer Inhaled COVID Vaccine as Booster Shot,China’s drug regulator became the first in the world to approve the new type of vaccine for emergency use in September.,2022-10-26,"Shanghai will start offering inhaled COVID-19 vaccines as a booster, as the city became one of the first to adopt the new technology greenlit for emergency use last month. The domestically developed vaccine from CanSino Biologics is targeted toward residents aged 18 and above who have been double vaccinated six months ago, the city government announced Tuesday. Currently, China is the only country to have approved an inhaled vaccine targeting the coronavirus. Compared with an injected vaccine, an inhaled version enables individuals to induce an immune response at the mucosal surfaces of the nose and mouth, where the coronavirus is most likely to invade the body. Chinese experts have endorsed its effectiveness, with one official saying earlier this year that it was like “drinking a Coke.” But many have expressed concerns over its efficacy and safety. While China’s drug regulator approved CanSino’s inhaled vaccine for emergency use in September, it has yet to complete large-scale phase III trials. Two small-scale human studies involving the inhaled vaccine in China have shown promising results, with one published in the British medical journal The Lancet in 2021. Following its approval last month, the city of Urumqi in the northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on Friday urged all its frontline COVID workers to get the inhaled booster amid local virus flare-ups. It’s unclear whether the inhaled vaccine will work against different strains of the coronavirus, since the clinical trial data from CanSino only validated its effectiveness against the BA.1 subvariant instead of the more dominant BA.4 and BA.5 versions, domestic outlet Yicai reported. Citing unspecified research results, Shanghai’s announcement claimed the inhaled vaccine could “substantially strengthen an immune response” and maintain a high level of antibodies within a six-month period. Shanghai’s push for the new type of vaccine comes at a time when the country’s vaccination progress has stalled, especially among the older demographic. China has so far approved 10 domestically developed coronavirus vaccines for emergency use but is yet to give the green light for the use of those developed elsewhere. As of July. 23, 89% of the country’s 1.4 billion people were said to be fully vaccinated, with 72% having received a booster shot, according to the country’s top health authority.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011493
Chinese Man Detained for Creating Fake ‘Iron Man’ Health Code,"The blue health code, which went viral online, claimed to give immunity from post-COVID infection virus testing.",2022-10-25,"A man in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been detained for creating a fake health code, implying that it temporarily exempted individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 from undergoing PCR tests. The man, surnamed Dou, has been given a 10-day detention over the blue “Iron Man” health code and for causing confusion online with the non-existent code, local authorities in Yining said Monday. Dou nicknamed the code after a local community in the city gave individuals who recovered from COVID an “Iron Man certificate,” urging them to join the pandemic control workforce and get exempted from daily PCR tests. China uses a traffic light-like health code system for COVID control measures, which is largely used to track and trace infections. The color codes are also used to grant and restrict access to public transport and other places, with some local governments misusing it for non-COVID-related issues. The cyberspace and public security bureaus in Yining, located in Ili Kazakh autonomous prefecture, said that the screenshot of the blue code triggered widespread discussion online and “caused an adverse social impact.” They said Dou was detained for allegedly “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” The community that first introduced the “Iron Man certificate” also apologized Monday for the “inappropriate name” given to recovered COVID patients. It blamed the name on the “sloppy” work of its staff. Xinjiang has been attempting to stamp out local COVID outbreaks since late July, with the region logging more than 5,100 cases so far this month alone. Last month, authorities in Ili Kazakh autonomous prefecture apologized for the lack of access to sufficient health care during lockdowns.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011482
China Spends Holiday ‘Lying Flat’ Amid Heavy Travel Restrictions,"With long-distance travel strictly controlled, many Chinese are checking into upscale local resorts for the weeklong National Day holiday.",2022-10-03,"SHANGHAI — For this year’s National Day holiday, Zhao Zhiyan and her husband have decided to get away from it all. The couple plan to travel to a fancy hotel on the outskirts of Shanghai — around 20 kilometers from their apartment. Like millions of others, the pair are unable to travel beyond the city limits due to China’s strict pandemic controls. This trip will be the furthest they’ve ventured from home in 2022. Zhao feels lucky to be making even this short journey. She declines to reveal how much she spent to secure a spot in the five-star hotel; rooms in Shanghai’s upscale resorts are like gold dust this holiday. “We will stay in the hotel the whole time,” the 29-year-old told Sixth Tone. “We want to relax and have contact with as few people as possible.” Many in China plan to “lie flat” in local hotels this week, as the country has once again imposed heavy restrictions on long-distance travel for the seven-day public holiday. Authorities are being even more cautious than normal, with the historic 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China due to take place just days after the holiday ends. The Chinese mainland reported a total of 655 local infections on Sunday; nearly 80% of provincial-level governments discovered at least one case. Local authorities have issued repeated warnings against long-distance travel. Many employers and residential committees have imposed extra controls: Some have banned travel outright, while others have required people to provide a “valid reason” for travel in advance.   The restrictions have drastically curbed people’s travel plans. Chinese tech giant Meituan has described this week as a “local holiday,” with the majority of consumers planning to stay within their local area. In a user survey, Meituan found that 70% of people do not plan to leave their city or province this week. Shopping, going to restaurants, and staying in local hotels and homestays are the most popular activities this holiday, the company said. Only 62,000 commercial flights are scheduled to take place during the National Day holiday, down over 22% compared with last year and nearly 40% compared with 2019. China’s trains are expected to handle just 68.5 million passenger trips between Sept. 28 and Oct. 8, whereas 110 million trips were made between Sept. 28 and Oct. 7 last year. Unable to take a vacation, many Chinese are instead scrambling to book luxurious “staycations” in nearby resorts. Online travel platform Trip.com reported Saturday that local bookings were up 98% on the first day of the holiday compared with the Mid-Autumn Festival last month. Nearly 60% of local hotel and homestay bookings were made by people born after 1990, the company added. Many hotels have hiked prices significantly for the holiday, the state-owned China News reported Saturday. In Beijing, one resort had increased its room rates from under 2,000 yuan ($280) per night to 3,888 yuan for Oct. 6; another from a few hundred yuan to an astonishing 5,000 yuan for Oct. 2, though the hotel denied this. Chen, a manager of a boutique homestay in east China’s Zhejiang province, told Sixth Tone Monday that they’d increased their room rates by around 300 yuan for the holiday, with prices ranging from 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan per night. “Our guests typically book a day or two in advance, and many drive from Shanghai,” Chen said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011347

"Citing COVID, China Discourages Domestic Holiday Travel, Again",The strict travel rules come amid an uptick in coronavirus cases across the country.,2022-09-09,"China will tighten COVID-19 restrictions for domestic travel and group gatherings until the end of October to avoid more local outbreaks, the country’s health authority said Thursday, dampening holiday spirits ahead of one of the country’s major travel seasons. The National Health Commission urged people to “celebrate locally” and minimize intercity travel during the upcoming public holidays, when hundreds of millions of people hit the road. Exhibitions, performances, and other group gatherings deemed unnecessary have also been discouraged to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. For the three-day Mid-Autumn Festival that kicks off Saturday, travelers are required to present a negative PCR result from the last 48 hours to board planes, ferries, trains, and inter-provincial buses, the health authority said. During the National Day holiday period starting Oct. 1, travelers will also be asked to take “voluntary” tests at cities nationwide when they arrive. The NHC has also advised people to hold weddings, funerals, and other ritual ceremonies “in a simplified manner.” The stricter requirements come as more Chinese cities are under lockdown, as authorities prepare for the twice-a-decade National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing starting Oct. 16. The city has already asked residents not to travel to places that have reported new cases within seven days. China logged 1,292 local infections on Thursday, which were recorded in over two-thirds of all of its provincial-level regions. China’s “zero-COVID” policy requires local authorities to stamp out every infection chain, often leading to strict curbs on daily life and business operations. By early September, over 65 million people in at least 33 Chinese cities, including Urumqi, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Harbin, had implemented partial or citywide lockdowns, according to financial outlet Caixin. As lockdowns extend, residents in some cities have complained of food shortages, unmet medical needs, and mobility restrictions. With travel restrictions, short-distance trips are expected to dominate this travel season, according to domestic travel companies. On booking site Qunar.com, sales of flight tickets rose modestly before Saturday, though the average price saw a five-year low for Mid-Autumn Festival travel.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011198
Guiyang Lockdown Makes a Supersized Community Go Hungry,Residents at Huaguoyuan Community say they are running out of food amid COVID-19 restrictions.,2022-09-08,"Residents of a supersized housing complex in the southwestern Guizhou province, also known as Asia’s largest residential community, have complained of dwindling food supplies and hunger amid the COVID-19 lockdown in a familiar story that has played out in several cities over the past months. Several residents at Guiyang’s Huaguoyuan Community, which is home to 500,000 people, said they were either running out of supplies or had gone without any food for few days after their compounds were locked down Saturday, according to social media posts. Some have even made desperate pleas to neighbors asking for any leftover food. “An older resident at Huaguoyuan Area 1 hasn’t eaten anything for three days,” read a screenshot from messaging app WeChat posted on microblogging platform Weibo. “Please help to spread the word out or send some food.” The city of Guiyang has reported 301 coronavirus cases as of Wednesday in the latest flare-up that has triggered lockdowns in other parts of southwest China, including cities in Sichuan province and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Around 23% of the city’s symptomatic cases were linked to the housing complex, local authorities said, as several districts and communities remained cordoned off Thursday.  Lockdowns, along with passport-like health codes, have been an integral part of China’s “zero-COVID” policy since the start of the pandemic. Several major cities, including Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi’an, and Sanya have gone into lockdowns in the past nine months alone, with some 33 cities currently under some form of restriction, according to Caixin Global. Such restrictions have often resulted in the disruption of supply chains, hindering logistics and deliveries of daily essentials. On Wednesday, Guiyang’s pandemic control committee apologized to Huaguoyuan residents, pledging to improve distribution and resolve food shortage issues. Located in downtown Nanming District, Huaguoyuan claims to be China’s largest urban village redevelopment project and has a total construction area of 18.3 million square meters. The compound has become Guiyang’s major tourism landmark, featuring a shopping mall resembling the White House and hundreds of high-rise buildings. The lockdown in Huaguoyuan has drawn the ire of users on social media, with many sympathizing with residents and criticizing the local government’s food distribution plan. A related hashtag on Weibo has been viewed over 12 million times as of Thursday afternoon. “This is surreal. We live in 2022 and yet there are people starving in provincial capital cities like Guiyang,” commented a Weibo user surnamed Lin under a local media report.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011180
Chinese Universities Start New Semester With Old COVID Rules,Some schools have adopted strict measures as students complain about lackluster college life.,2022-08-31,"University students across China are starting a new semester with anxiety — not over academic life, but austere coronavirus-related measures. Many schools across the country have announced strict COVID-19 curbs in regulating students’ movements in and outside campuses to prevent possible outbreaks. These include regular coronavirus testing and distancing from the outside world. At Shanghai University, students are not allowed to leave the campus area “unless necessary” and need to fill an application each time they leave. For many students in the city, such restrictions have evoked familiar feelings from the spring, when they were locked within the university premises for months as the city tried to contain its worst outbreak. “I would move out again to continue my internship if the curbs continue,” Wang Mengmeng, a 24-year-old master’s student at the school, told Sixth Tone. Students say such rules are excessive, when the city has reported just a handful of cases in the past month. Earlier this month, the country’s top education authority also restricted higher education institutions from imposing additional curbs on students coming from “low-risk” areas with no COVID cases, asking schools to implement “more convenient” mechanisms instead. However, many universities have instead announced stricter controls as new and highly transmissible coronavirus subvariants continue to be found in many areas. Such controls usually include frequent testing and a “closed loop” management system for up to 14 days, without promising when such measures would end. Wang said that her campus even set a 10-minute limit for commuting within different areas of the school, or have their college codes turn red that would require them to reapply for entry again. Those who have visited a hospital must undergo a three-day “health observation” at designated spots before re-entering their dorms. At the Jiaying University in southern Guangdong province, students are being barred from leaving the campus even on weekends, according to Zhong Yurou, an undergraduate student. She said the restrictions have wiped out almost all of their entertainment activities. “We will have no delicious meals, no movies, and no other entertainment on weekends since none of these will constitute a proper reason for leaving the campus,” she said. Several universities have even postponed when term will start due to the sporadic flare-up of COVID cases lately, according to media reports. In the past week, China logged over 10,000 local cases across at least 20 provinces and regions. The stringent policies have unnerved students hoping to start a fresh semester, with many complaining on social media. Students also mourned the loss of a “normal” college experience that has been redefined by the pandemic over the past two years. “I have so many dreams and plans to fulfill in college, and now I have to worry about the possibility of going home,” Madina, a student from Shanghai International Studies University who only gave her first name, told Sixth Tone. “The pandemic just robbed me of most of my youth.” Meanwhile, not everyone seemed opposed to the restrictions on campus, supporting schools that have been adapting to the “new normal.” “The pandemic could also mean the beginning of a new type of college life,” Zhang Luyao, another student from Shanghai International Studies University, said. “I will still strive to make the most of college life without having any regrets.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011115
Live Fish Take COVID-19 Tests in Xiamen,Officials in Xiamen confirmed that the city is giving PCR tests to newly caught fish for COVID-19 following a viral video of medical workers giving a throat swab to a yellow croaker.,2022-08-18,"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach him to test fish for COVID-19… “It’s time for old Croakey’s nucleic acid test. Open your mouth,” says a fisherman from Xiamen to the yellow croaker he just caught, in a viral video clip. In the clip, a medical worker inserts a cotton swab into the mouth of a live fish and then scrubs the surface of crabs to test them for COVID-19. It sounds like a comedy sketch, but local authorities confirm that they’re testing fish for the virus. An employee from the Xiamen Municipal Bureau of Ocean Development confirmed the news to Sixth Tone Thursday. He said that performing COVID-19 tests on seafood is a common practice, especially since an outbreak of the virus in the island province of Hainan.  The video, widely circulated on Chinese social media, has reignited online discussions about how much COVID-19 testing is too much. The coronavirus virant ravaging Hainan could be traced to Vietnam, gene sequencing conducted by the government shows. The regional outbreak in Hainan might be caused by illegal trade between Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen, according to a government briefing. COVID control authorities in Xiamen’s Jimei District require fishermen to take COVID-19 tests after returning from sea, according to guidelines released July 22. The regulator said the move and other safety measures aim to avoid regional COVID-19 outbreaks caused by “illegal trade and contact with foreign ships.” China has tested imported frozen food and airmail for the virus since two outbreaks in Beijing were traced by local authorities to a piece of salmon and a letter from abroad. Experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in an interview with state television in July that fish do not get infected by COVID-19, but can be contaminated with it during the catch, transportation, or processing. Such contamination is usually on the surface of the fish. Chinese netizens had mixed reactions. “Maybe a test on fish skin instead of the throat would work,” said a popular comment on the Twitter-like platform Weibo. Some said it’s a “waste of resources” and ridiculed the decision. “I’m afraid the bee in my house would sting me, so I burn the house down,” commented another Weibo user with the handle Duoduo Mimi. “Shall we give the fish a green code after it’s tested negative? Or does it have to take another test one week later if it’s not sold?” asked another Weibo user. Xiamen reported 10 COVID-19 cases in humans on Wednesday, and zero in fish.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1011010
"In ‘Zero-COVID’ China, the Elderly Are Becoming Ever More Marginalized","In China’s major cities, residents now have to use “digital health codes” to do pretty much anything: from entering a restaurant to using a public restroom. For the many seniors who don’t have smartphones, that’s a big problem.",2022-08-09,"SHANGHAI — For years, Gu Hong has enjoyed visiting the local deli near her home. Whenever the 73-year-old didn’t feel like cooking, she’d wander down the street to buy a steaming plate of sweet-and-sour ribs. Then Shanghai went into lockdown, and everything changed. When Gu returned to the deli in June, she found herself barred from entering. “The staff said I had to scan the venue code with my cell phone before I could order,” an indignant Gu tells Sixth Tone. “This is the rule, and they just follow the rules.” The encounter was just the start of Gu’s problems. Like many Chinese seniors, she doesn’t use a smartphone. Yet it’s now becoming almost impossible to live a normal life without one. China has been using personalized digital QR codes — known as “health codes” — to track and trace COVID-19 infections and close contacts since the start of the pandemic. But in recent months, as the highly infectious Omicron variant has spread nationwide, this digital surveillance system has gone into overdrive. Before Shanghai went into lockdown in April, residents only had to show a green code to gain admission to a few large-scale venues, such as shopping malls, airports, or government buildings. Now, it’s compulsory when doing pretty much anything: from riding public transport, to entering a store, restaurant, or café. Even public restrooms require a green code.  What’s more, the system has become far more complex. Residents are now required to take a nucleic acid test every 72 hours to access public places, which are tracked using the health code and a special “nucleic acid test code.” Then, to enter a venue, they have to scan a “venue code” at the entrance that logs their location, personal information, and COVID testing history. Anyone arriving in a new city, meanwhile, has to present a separate “travel code” that carries a record of their travel history. The new rules have been effective at preventing a rebound in cases, but they have also caused huge disruption — especially for the millions of seniors like Gu who struggle to operate digital devices. In many cases, they’re intensifying the social isolation elderly people already face in many parts of China. Gu has been left feeling increasingly marginalized. Her daughter gave her a smartphone in June and tried to teach her how to use it, but Gu gave up after a few attempts. The multiple codes with their differing uses were too confusing. “I haven’t used high-tech gadgets my entire life, so it’s not realistic to ask me to show various codes on my phone all the time,” says Gu. “As we age, our ability to understand things becomes more limited. I feel very powerless.”  Indignities have piled up. When Gu went to a shopping mall to meet her family, she took a printout of her health code — a measure Shanghai introduced to help people without phones. But the staff asked her to walk around the building to a different entrance, as staff at the main gate couldn’t scan paper codes. “It’s a long walk,” Gu says. “In addition to the inconvenience, it makes me feel inferior to others.” Shortly after that, Gu witnessed a man in his 80s pee his pants outside a public bathroom, as the staff refused to let him enter without scanning the venue code. Gu winces as she recalls the man’s hands shaking while he fumbled with his phone. “A group of people saw that, and we were all judging the staff,” says Gu. “This could happen to any senior, and I can’t even imagine how humiliated I would have felt if it had been me.” After these bad experiences, Gu no longer feels like going out as much, especially when she’s on her own. She has become more dependent on her daughter, asking her to accompany her on errands and drive her around. “I’m worried about my mom’s mental health,” Gu’s daughter, surnamed Li, tells Sixth Tone. “She used to be outgoing and independent, but now she rarely smiles.”  Gu is far from alone. China had over 1 billion internet users as of December 2021, including 119 million users aged 60 or over, according to a government report. But that means that more than half of China’s elderly population — around 145 million people — remain “offline.” Over 30% of seniors are unable to access their health codes by themselves, the report adds. Reports of seniors suffering due to the strict virus-control rules have proliferated in recent months, sparking public backlash. In early June, a video went viral on Chinese social media showing an elderly man in Shanghai being forced to get off a bus after failing to scan the venue code. He spends two minutes trying to scan the code, before finally giving up. “I won’t bother you then,” he says as he exits the bus. Weeks later, another viral clip emerged showing a 90-year-old woman trying to buy sliced noodles for her birthday from a store in Shanghai. The staff, however, refused to serve her because she was unable to scan the venue code. In Wuxi, a city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, meanwhile, a man in his 70s reportedly got trapped inside a railway station for three days because he was unable to scan the venue code. So far, there has been little research published on how China’s pandemic-control measures have impacted the elderly population’s mental health. One paper released in May 2021, however, noted that elderly people who have difficulties using smartphones are likely to experience feelings of anxiety and depression. Chinese authorities have made some attempts to make the system easier for seniors to use. As early as November 2020, the State Council issued new rules requiring all venues to stop relying solely on the health code as a way to verify visitors’ COVID status. Instead, there should always be an alternative method available, such as checking a person’s ID card or a paper certificate.  A month later, national authorities also ordered tech companies to adjust their platforms to make them more user-friendly, offering larger fonts, simpler interfaces, and voice recognition that recognizes regional dialects in addition to standard Mandarin. Shanghai, meanwhile, created an “offline code” — a print version of the city’s health QR code — that seniors can use to access venues in August 2021. Last month, the city also launched a service that connects seniors’ ID cards with their travel cards, which should allow them to access public transport by presenting their offline code rather than scanning a venue code. But many seniors continue to struggle. For one thing, a large number of venues — especially small-scale private businesses — don’t have the equipment to check offline codes. Plus, China’s “zero-COVID” system remains fragmented and complicated. Each city has its own digital monitoring system, which often includes several different codes. It’s not just confusing and inconvenient for the elderly. Zheng Lei, a professor at Shanghai’s Fudan University and director of its Lab for Digital and Mobile Governance, says that the authorities need to simplify their systems. He proposes a “complete” transformation, with the government moving toward a “use one code to access everything” system, rather than “requiring multiple codes in succession.”  “Digitization and informatization are meant to make life easier,” says Zheng. “It should be a tool to serve people, not the other way around.” Zheng adds that the authorities should overhaul their systems so that they are more intuitive to use. At the moment, local health codes tend to have abstract, formal names, meaning that people often don’t understand what they are for. “We could call the ‘offline code’ an ‘epidemic travel card,’ so that the elderly can understand,” he suggests. For now, seniors are finding their own ways to cope with the new rules. In late July, Sixth Tone rode a dozen buses in Shanghai to observe how accessible the public transport system is for elderly passengers. Most residents over 70 had printed out an offline code to ride the bus, while others used their phones to scan the vehicle’s venue code. One passenger, surnamed Ma, held a shopping bag in one hand while gripping her phone in the other. “I don’t have my glasses with me today, so I was a little nervous since I can’t see the screen clearly,” says Ma. “Sometimes the phone freezes, which makes me anxious, and sometimes I even get dizzy.” Though Ma finds it difficult to access the health codes via her phone, the 61-year-old has decided against applying for a printed offline code. “Deep down inside, I feel if I hold an offline code, it implies I’m old and incapable,” she says.  Zhuang Yinghua, 65, spoke with Sixth Tone as she scanned the venue code to enter the metro. She had asked her son to buy her a new phone in June, so that it was easier for her to access the various codes. “I specifically said I want the same brand,” she says. On a piece of paper, Zhuang has written down step-by-step instructions for turning on the phone and accessing each code. She practices several times before leaving the house each morning, she says. Wang Zengcheng, a student at Fudan University, has been teaching local seniors to use smartphones since last May, organizing free classes for the elderly in residential communities. Until the lockdown in April, most of her students were able to learn how to use the health code without much difficulty, but things are trickier now, she says. “It was before the outbreak, so they only had to learn one code,” says Wang. “There is now a variety of codes, which is difficult for them to adapt to.” Zheng, the professor, says these kinds of classes can be useful, but stresses that they should be voluntary. “The elderly should be able to choose not to learn about cell phones, instead of being threatened with exclusion if they don’t learn,” he says. “For elderly people with poor eyesight and no desire to learn how to use a smartphone, we should provide some alternatives.”   Starting from September, Shanghai will upgrade the scanning equipment on all buses, so that passengers’ travel cards, ID information, and COVID test histories are all linked and can be checked simultaneously. This should mean that passengers who swipe a travel card linked to their ID card will no longer need to show an offline code or scan a venue code when riding the bus. For seniors like Gu, it’s a small step back toward normality. The septuagenarian is taking any small victories where she can, noting that she now only has to attend two — rather than three — mandatory weekly COVID tests in her residential complex. “I think it’s a good sign,” Gu says. “I hope soon enough we won’t need to travel and live based on nucleic acid tests and health codes.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010908
China’s Getaway Beach Destination Becomes COVID-19 Hotspot,"About 80,000 tourists are said to be stranded in Sanya as the city announced a lockdown over the weekend.",2022-08-08,"The coastal resort town of Sanya was able to hold any large-scale COVID-19 outbreaks at bay for much of the pandemic. But it’s now China’s latest coronavirus hotspot, resulting in a snap lockdown and tens of thousands of tourists left stranded. The city in the island province of Hainan has been in a “temporary static management” mode since Saturday, and has reported over 1,200 local infections between Aug. 1 and 7, local authorities said. Sanya also suspended public transport, ordered business closures, and sealed residential compounds to contain the outbreak which officials said was at a “rising stage.” Around 80,000 visitors were said to be vacationing in the city when the lockdown was announced, with some 40% stuck in their hotels, He Shigang, the city’s deputy mayor, told state broadcaster China Central Television on Friday. Those leaving Sanya are required to have five negative PCR test results in seven days. The abrupt lockdown caught many tourists off guard, who then had to rush to find ways out of the city. Viral videos on social media showed crowds of passengers stranded at the local airport Saturday after most flights were canceled. A visitor who identified herself as Anqi told Sixth Tone that she was in Sanya with her husband for their honeymoon. She said the couple decided to cut short their holiday on Aug. 3 and tried to leave the city, but their flight was canceled 30 minutes before departure, and they ended up in a hotel assigned to them by local authorities. “I never expected my romantic wedding tour to become an arduous escape,” she said. “All I hope is to get away a week later as planned.” On Monday, an employee on Sanya Phoenix International Airport’s hotline told Sixth Tone that all flights to and from the city were canceled and they were unsure about when the flights would resume. Authorities have meanwhile vowed to assist stranded tourists by clamping down on price hikes and have urged hotels to offer a 50% discount on accommodation. “We understand the tourists’ inconvenience and ask for understanding and support,” Ye Kaizhong, the deputy secretary of Sanya’s municipal government, said in a press conference Sunday. The outbreak came as many thousands of holidaymakers flocked to the resort city for the peak summer season, as they tried to escape restrictions in their hometowns. Authorities said the outbreak in Sanya has been triggered by the BA.5.1.3 Omicron subvariant, the first time it has been detected in China. While the city saw a robust growth in tourism in July, experts told domestic media the blanket closure has marked an end to the boom. It would cast adverse effects on tens of thousands of business owners and would likely require a long recovery period. “This is the worst outbreak, and it’s a disaster to all the local hotels,” a Sanya resident surnamed Chen told Sixth Tone. “But we have to be cooperative and hopefully we can make it through.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010929
"Mass Red, Yellow Health Codes Confuse Henan County Residents",Authorities said they have “corrected” the actions intended to curb COVID-19 cases in Minquan County.,2022-08-05,"Authorities in central China have backtracked on a controversial policy that allowed a county government to arbitrarily change the health code status of residents and curtail their movements following an online backlash over harsh COVID-19 control measures. Minquan, a county with 700,000 people in Henan province, put its entire population under a “health code-based management” system and gave them either red or yellow codes depending on the coronavirus hotspots, according to a social media post by the state-owned Shangqiu Daily that has since been deleted. The traffic light-like health codes are China’s integral COVID control tool, with a red code only given to those infected with the virus or their close contacts, while a yellow code is reserved for those in quarantine or who have missed several nucleic acid tests, also known as PCR tests, in a row. A day after the post, authorities in Shangqiu, a larger city that administers Minquan, said on Thursday they have “corrected” the local policy that “temporarily” changed the health code color of people with a travel history to local coronavirus hotspots. The initial idea in Minquan, they added, was to “ensure that the risk of the epidemic does not spill over and that no one is missed in the nucleic acid testing.” It’s unclear whether the initial policy gave yellow or red health codes to all residents in the county. A woman living in the downtown area, which is not identified as a local COVID hotspot, told Sixth Tone that her health code turned red Wednesday even though she hadn’t left home and switched back to green Thursday night. “Many people experienced this,” said the woman over the phone, adding that there were no COVID cases in her residential complex, and she still isn’t able to move freely. Sixth Tone’s request for comments on the health code policy to Minquan’s publicity office Friday was referred to the government-run hotline. The hotline number remained busy by the time of publication. Meanwhile, residents in Minquan said they have been asked to stay put for over a week as the government tries to stamp out the virus by halting the movement of people. Since a local outbreak started in late July, the county has logged 233 local infections as of Thursday. Xu Benjun, a resident of Nan Village in the county, which is identified as a local COVID-19 hotspot, said his health code remains yellow because there were still COVID cases in his area. Over 1,000 people in his village have been asked to stay at home, undergo a daily PCR test, and are prohibited from doing their farm work. But it’s not just Minquan residents who have been baffled by the sudden change in their health code status. A resident from the provincial capital Zhengzhou told Southern Metropolis Daily that she found her health code turned yellow Saturday after a train ride through Minquan in mid-July. She said the yellow code has restricted her mobility and affected her work, and repeated calls to the local disease control and prevention office have failed to result in her code turning green again. Health codes have become the dominant tool to control COVID, but its widespread deployment has raised concerns over the abuse of such technology. In June, thousands of depositors from the province’s struggling rural banks found their health code turned red, restricting their movement as they planned to seek answers from the regulators and withdraw their savings. The provincial authorities eventually punished local officials for giving red health codes “without authorization.” But legal experts have called for more accountability over the misuse of the public health tool.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010922

Schools Tell Children: Ask Your Grandparents to Get COVID Shots,A school in Shanghai asked students to encourage their older family members to get vaccinated in return for awards.,2022-07-28,"Several Chinese schools have been found to be linking students’ performance evaluations or even registration to their grandparents’ vaccination records, raising concerns over the measures to get older residents vaccinated against COVID-19. A screenshot of an announcement by Xuelang Middle School in the eastern city of Wuxi showed all junior school freshmen should offer vaccination certificates of their grandparents aged 60 or above — unless there were “special circumstances” — before they started school. The announcement was published Monday, though the school told domestic media the following day that such a requirement had been canceled. Earlier this month, the Third Central Primary School in Shanghai’s Hongkou District also launched a campaign urging its students to get their grandparents vaccinated during the summer holiday, or make a promotional poster or video if their older family members were unable to get the shot. The participation would qualify students for being selected for certain honors in the fall semester, according to a notice released by the public school. As the highly infectious Omicron subvariant has added pressure on the country’s health system, authorities have ramped up efforts to get most of the population vaccinated, especially older residents who have lower immunity and are most vulnerable to the coronavirus. The latest data shows 84.7% of people over the age of 60 have completed a two-dose regimen of the COVID-19 vaccine, though many of them have yet to get a booster shot, health officials said at a Saturday press conference. Meanwhile, 40% of the 35 million people aged over 80 are yet to be fully vaccinated. In a city like Shanghai with a notably aging population, the vaccination rate among those aged 60 and above lags behind the national average, with the full vaccine rate at around 66%, according to local health officials. Responding to concerns over vaccine hesitancy among older residents due to having chronic illnesses, Shanghai health authorities said on Monday that those with such illnesses were particularly vulnerable to the virus and in more urgent need to get vaccinated. Though experts and officials have reassured that vaccination could prevent older residents from serious illness after an infection, many remain skeptical amid claims of adverse reactions among the elderly after receiving the shots. Experts have rejected such online posts saying the vaccines would cause health risks such as leukemia and diabetes.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010865
Chinese Experts Refute ‘Wrong’ Claims on Domestic COVID Vaccines,Experts rejected online claims that say the shots caused cancer and diabetes.,2022-07-25,"Chinese COVID-19 vaccines will not lead to health risks such as leukemia or diabetes, a top Chinese expert said, dismissing claims made online that people were diagnosed with blood cancer and children developed diabetes after receiving the shots. Wang Fusheng, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that such claims were “irresponsible and wrong” at a time when disinformation on the country’s homemade vaccines has made many hesitant about receiving the shots. While the country has vaccinated over 90% of the population using various domestic shots, many parents of young children and older residents are still skeptical of COVID vaccines. “If the vaccines do trigger diabetes or leukemia, the number of people affected would have significantly increased,” Wang said at a press conference Saturday. “But based on clinical data, this didn’t happen.” In 2021 and 2021, leukemia patients accounted for 0.13% of all hospitalized cases, similar to the levels seen in 2018 and 2019, respectively, according to clinical monitoring data released at the press conference. The proportion of diabetic patients stood at 2.2% during the past two years, increasing slightly by 0.1% from 2018 and 2019. However, many parents have long harbored doubts. At the end of May, a group of parents published a joint letter online, claiming over 600 kids across 26 provinces had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes after receiving COVID-19 vaccines, mostly produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac. Parents said their children developed symptoms, including an increased feeling of thirst and hunger, one to three months after receiving the shots, and were later diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is rarer than the commonly seen Type 2 and is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Zeng Xifeng, who organizes a major online community for Type 1 diabetes patients in China, told Sixth Tone that there is no scientific evidence from elsewhere in the world that has used Chinese vaccines to support the claims made by those families. “It’s just parents making assumptions,” he added. Likewise, another group of people, aged between 3 and 70, have also claimed in May that they were diagnosed with leukemia after receiving domestically made vaccines. It’s widely believed that leukemia develops from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Chang Rongshan, a virologist at Shantou University, told a domestic media outlet specializing in health that such a possibility was almost non-existent. Referring to the Chinese inactivated vaccines, which includes the Sinovac shot, he said that they don’t contain anything that can cause diseases as claimed by some people. “The difference between inactivated vaccines and the real COVID-19 virus is that the former has no capacity to cause a disease,” Chang said. “The inactivated vaccines soon get cleared by the immunity system and don’t have long-term effects.” As of early April, about 85% of those aged 60 and above had received COVID-19 vaccines, according to the top health authority. However, some 40% of people aged 80 and above, who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, are yet to be vaccinated. Zeng Yixin, vice director of the National Health Commission, encouraged people to get vaccinated during Saturday’s press conference. To strengthen public confidence, he said that all party and state officials have been vaccinated, publicly acknowledging the vaccination status of the country’s leaders for the first time. “This shows the great attention our leaders pay to the pandemic control work and the full trust they hold in the domestically produced vaccines,” Zeng said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010837
"First Tragedy, Then Farce: The Chaos Engulfing China’s Broadway","In Shanghai, theaters are finally reopening after a four-month shutdown. But putting on a show isn’t easy — especially when your cast, director, and audience members could be locked down again at any moment.",2022-07-18,"SHANGHAI — Xiang Zheng remembers the exact moment that Shanghai’s theater boom came to a crashing halt. It was the evening of March 11, and the young actor was sitting in his college dorm. Then, the chat groups on his phone suddenly lit up. The deluge of messages were from producers all over the city, saying their shows had abruptly been called off by the authorities. Inside theaters, confusion reigned. Most productions were due to begin in minutes. “All the actors had already changed into their costumes, put on their makeup, and tested the microphones,” Xiang recalls. “The audiences were already lined up outside the entrances.” The cancellations were just the beginning. Shanghai was in the early stages of China’s worst COVID-19 outbreak since 2020. Weeks later, the entire city of 25 million went into total lockdown. Most residents wouldn’t be released from their apartment complexes for two months.  The outbreak has plunged Shanghai’s theater scene into chaos. Just months ago, the city had a thriving market for musicals, and local officials had ambitious plans to develop China’s answer to Broadway. Now, that dream threatens to unravel. Some theaters finally reopened on July 8 after a four-month shutdown, but the problems haven’t ended there. Shanghai continues to impose snap lockdowns as new infections emerge, making life highly unpredictable. Shows are called off after venues abruptly shut down. Directors have to replace cast members confined to their homes at the last minute. Musical fans are often unwilling, or unable, to attend shows. For actors like Xiang, the future looks highly uncertain. Some have earned practically nothing for months. Others are making plans to take low-paying jobs at state-run theater troupes — or leave the country altogether. “If something (like the lockdown) happens again, I’m screwed,” Xiang tells Sixth Tone.  A sudden reversal It has been a cruel twist of fate for an industry that appeared to be on the rise. Unlike elsewhere, China’s theater companies had been riding a massive boom through most of the pandemic. Broadway-style musicals used to be a niche market in China, but that changed in 2019 with the reality TV show “Super-Vocal.” A singing contest themed around classic show tunes, the program became a runaway hit and brought musical theater to a whole new audience. China’s initial COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 led to monthslong closures for many theaters, but this didn’t check the industry’s growth. In 2021, musicals generated over 1 billion yuan (then $155 million) in China, up from 600 million yuan in 2019, with a stage adaptation of Chinese TV series “The Bad Kids” doing particularly well.  Shanghai backed the trend enthusiastically. The city dreamed of creating its own version of Broadway, with much of its efforts focused on fostering an “off-Broadway” ecosystem of smaller venues. By the end of 2021, it had opened around 100 new mini theaters — many converted from old offices and factories — each with around 50-200 seats. These “off-Broadway” theaters thrived during the pandemic, with local authorities providing ticketing subsidies to aid the industry’s recovery. At Asia Mansion, the city’s best-known new venue, the most popular musicals were staged over 300 times in 2021, usually to full houses. The shows were often low-budget and far less polished than top U.S. productions, Cao Wenqiong, a local drama student, tells Sixth Tone. But, then again, they didn’t have to compete with them due to China’s “zero-COVID” restrictions. Foreign productions have effectively been shut out of the country since early 2020.  For young actors like Xiang, it was a golden period. Before 2019, even veteran Chinese performers often struggled to get gigs. But Xiang was offered leading roles while still a college senior. He made his musical stage debut in January — playing an editor in an adaptation of the Korean detective show “The Fiction” — in front of a packed room. “I was amazed that so many people came to see the play,” says Xiang. “It had never occurred to me that a musical performer could win that many fans.” At the time, it seemed like the boom was just getting started. Yet, a few months later, Xiang would be struggling to make ends meet. “No one expected the shows would suddenly stop again,” he says. Things fall apart Two weeks after Shanghai abruptly shut down local theaters, the government imposed a full citywide lockdown. Xiang was confined to his cramped dorm room, which he shared with four other students. In the afternoons, he’d look out of his window at Yan’an Elevated Road — one of the city’s busiest expressways. There was barely a car to be seen. Before the lockdown, Xiang had gotten parts in two upcoming musicals. Rehearsing for the shows in his dorm, however, was almost impossible. The room was so small that Xiang couldn’t fully stretch his arms and legs. His dancing tutor tried to teach him the choreography via video call, but the camera could only cover part of Xiang’s body. “It’s also hard to develop a rapport with the other actors in the show online,” says Xiang. “Some of them I hadn’t even met in person, after all.”  Even leading actors found it difficult to cope. Li-Tong Hsu, a Chinese-Dutch musical star, is famous for playing leading roles in shows including “Cats,” “Miss Saigon,” and “Rent.” But during the lockdown, the performer had to spend much of her time on delivery apps, desperately trying to place orders. “My priority was grabbing food,” Hsu tells Sixth Tone. At first, Shanghai’s theater community — like the rest of the city — assumed that the lockdown would only last for a few days, as the government had indicated. Producers kept rescheduling shows for the following week and selling tickets as usual. But each week, they were forced to cancel them again. By late April, most had given up. Performers quickly began to struggle financially. Xiang saw his income fall dramatically, after 40 of his upcoming shows were canceled due to the lockdown. After graduating in June, he was forced to ask his parents to pay his rent. To stay sane, he began hosting livestreams for musical fans. “I shared my life with them, and then I sang songs and we talked,” says Xiang. “It gave some people joy, and gave me a sense of release.”  Star actor Wang Letian did the same thing. Early in the lockdown, he held a concert on his balcony, to his neighbors’ delight. Then, he organized a second performance on an empty lot inside his apartment compound, which was watched by 700,000 people on the social platform Weibo. Shanghai finally began easing its lockdown in late May, with theaters cleared to reopen at a reduced capacity in early July. By then, however, the performance industry’s financial problems had already become severe. During the first five months of 2022, the number of shows staged in China was down over 56% compared with last year, according to data from the China Association of Performing Arts. Box office revenues had dropped by over half as well. Given that much of the country had remained open, the fall in Shanghai was likely far greater. The show must go on Though many theaters have now reopened, the outbreak continues to cause disruption. For Han, a young actor in Shanghai, the resumption of performances has brought relief, but also exhaustion. His schedule has become completely manic. Han is currently starring in a detective-themed musical, while also preparing for another job that was pushed back to June due to the lockdown. He’s had to stay up till dawn to memorize his lines. Yet he can’t afford to lose either role, after spending months stuck in a rented apartment.  The actor is far from alone in this. Many performers will try to juggle multiple gigs to make extra cash, he predicts. “Some of my friends had no income in April and May and still had to pay rent,” says Han, who gave only his surname for privacy reasons. But Han worries about the knock-on effects this will have on quality. If the performances conflict with rehearsals, many actors will simply sacrifice the rehearsals, he says.  Hsu has been back in the rehearsal hall since early June, preparing for a new adaptation of the Korean musical “Gloomy Day 19260804.” The show is finally set to premiere on July 22, but Hsu remains wary of more lockdowns. If there are any more delays, it’ll clash with her next projects. “Hopefully we will be able to finish the run successfully,” she says. For producers, scheduling has become a nightmare. Zhang Zhilin, CEO of production company Muse Musicals, says his team has spent months trying to coordinate with actors as show after show got pushed back. Now, snap lockdowns are making things even more complicated. However, Muse has a tiny staff and has been able to survive, despite being forced to cancel over 600 shows and postpone the opening of two new plays. And the lockdown wasn’t all bad, Zhang says. At least it gave him time to organize the company’s old sets and props. But Boris Cao, the general manager of Harmonia Holdings, another production firm, worries about the industry’s long-term future. The audience for musicals in Shanghai appears to be shrinking due to the lockdowns, he says.  “Cultural consumption in theaters is not a necessity,” says Cao, who isn’t related to Cao Wenqiong. “People don’t have the habit of going to the theater anymore.” Harmonia has tried to adapt by experimenting with online shows. Since 2020, Cao has debuted a series about classic musicals such as “Les Misérables,” as well as an online immersive play based on Sherlock Holmes. “I’m not sure the audience will buy the idea, but at least it’s worth a try,” says Cao. Zhang hopes that foreign productions can soon re-enter the Chinese market, though this currently appears unlikely. Their absence benefitted domestic companies in the short term, but their return would give the whole industry a boost, he says. “The arrival of some classic Western shows in China can attract more audiences to the theater, and these audiences might watch local musicals in the future,” he says. For Zhang, the absence of Western productions will hold Chinese theater back in the long run. Domestic production companies will have no impetus to improve, he says. There’s also a risk that top Chinese talent will feel they need to move abroad to develop their skills. Lin Meichen has done just that. The 23-year-old is currently in London, where she will begin studying theater production this fall. She previously interned at several Chinese production companies, but felt the teams there weren’t disciplined enough. “Musicals in China still have a long way to go,” she says. Lin says several of her Chinese peers have decided to stay in Europe for a few more years, after seeing what happened in Shanghai this spring. Lin eventually wants to return home, though. “To me, British culture feels like a gentle stranger,” she says.  Xiang, meanwhile, is considering an option that is becoming more popular these days: taking a job with a state-run production company like the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center. Right now, the prospect of a guaranteed monthly paycheck looks attractive, he says. “The salary will, of course, not be as high as what I get now,” says Xiang.

"COVID Is Bankrupting China’s Private Hospitals, Media Report Says",Restrictions in mobility and hospital visits have led to a drop in patients over the past two years.,2022-07-12,"More than 100 private hospitals in China have gone bankrupt since the pandemic started two years ago, as strict government protocols on visiting medical facilities and mobility restrictions have reduced patient visits, according to financial media outlet Yicai. Some 46 private hospitals had filed for bankruptcy reorganization by July this year alone, Yicai reported, citing data from the business database Qichacha. In 2021, the number of such cases reached 100, up 25% year on year. “Some small private hospitals closed down after failing to survive the epidemic, but only some of them were reported publicly, and some enterprises that did not go through legal procedures were not recorded,” a manager of a private hospital told Yicai. Private hospitals, which are an important part of China’s medical system and complement public hospitals, have developed rapidly in the past decade. By the end of 2020, the country had 35,394 hospitals, of which two-thirds were private facilities, according to the National Health Commission. But the outbreak since the beginning of 2020 has led to a decline in hospital visits. The health authority estimated that 7.74 billion visits were made to medical institutions in 2020, down 11.2% from the previous year. According to an April report by the global consultancy Roland Berger, consumer health care such as medical aesthetics and dentistry were severely impacted in 2020. However, in 2021, leading private healthcare institutions have recovered to pre-epidemic levels, and some developed rapidly through capital operation and service upgrades. The manager of a dental hospital in Shanghai’s Pudong New Area told Sixth Tone on Wednesday that the “on and off” state caused by COVID outbreaks and lockdowns had a “significant impact on their business.” The number of outpatient visits from other parts of China had dropped “dramatically” since March. A manager of another private hospital in Shanghai told Sixth Tone that in addition to the large drop in patient numbers, they were unable to enjoy subsidy policies such as rent reductions and exemptions during the epidemic. He said it would be “difficult for hospitals to recover.” Meanwhile, the head of human resources at a private hospital in the southwestern city of Chengdu told Yicai that they had forecast losses but wouldn’t be laying off employees or minimizing their services for now. “(The hospital’s) initial investment is in research and development and talent training, so it must be prepared for long-term investment,” the head of HR said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010747
How China’s COVID Quarantine Rules Have Evolved,"Shorter isolation times, at-home health monitoring, and a definition of at-risk areas are part of the country’s new updated guidelines on coronavirus prevention.",2022-07-11,"China has shown signs of easing its strict COVID-19 restrictions while the rest of the world has largely been co-existing with the virus.  In one of the most drastic changes since early 2020, the country has halved the quarantine time for inbound passengers to seven days of centralized quarantine from at least 14 days, though it varies between cities and provinces. An additional three days of at-home health monitoring are then required.  It’s part of a broad easing of restrictions under China’s strict “zero-COVID” policy and was published in the ninth edition of the country’s COVID-19 prevention guidelines on June 28. The new strategy relies more upon testing, requiring more people to take nucleic acid tests more often.  The updated rules also establish standards for the so-called high-, medium-, and low-risk areas, key elements of contact tracing mechanisms that can restrict people’s mobility through a traffic light-like health code system. The at-risk areas are designated based on where infected people live, work, or may have visited. Below, we’ve mapped how China’s quarantine guidelines have evolved over the past two years of the pandemic.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010744
Beijing Requires Proof of COVID Vaccination to Enter Public Places,"Unvaccinated people won’t be allowed to enter public venues in the Chinese capital, with few exceptions.",2022-07-07,"Beijing has become the first city to introduce a COVID-19 vaccination policy that will restrict unvaccinated individuals from entering a wide range of public venues in the Chinese capital, according to local authorities.  Starting July 11, those in the capital will be required to show proof of vaccination to enter public places such as libraries, museums, cinemas, gyms, and tutoring centers, Li Ang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, said at a press conference Wednesday. The official added that the policy won’t apply to “those who are not suitable for vaccination,” without clarifying how people can prove such exemptions. Since the highly infectious Omicron subvariant of the coronavirus and its strains have resulted in multiple outbreaks and lockdowns across the country, authorities have been on a mission to vaccinate most of its population, especially older residents. In Beijing, over 23 million people have been vaccinated as of July 6, of whom more than 3 million were aged 60 and above, according to figures announced at the Wednesday press conference. Previous data suggested that over 80% of those aged 60 or above in the capital had been vaccinated against COVID-19 as of April. China has vaccinated 91.74% of its population as part of its massive voluntary vaccination drive, though getting the shot into the arms of the elderly has been a challenge. The most recent data from the National Health Commission shows that 87.99% of people above the age of 60 have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Those unwilling to get vaccinated, including many young people, are discontent about the policy. Yang Fan, a Beijing based-art critic, told Sixth Tone using a pseudonym. “I’m angry, but I guess I’ll compromise in the end.” Yang said her job requires her to visit cinemas and museums, leaving her with no other options. The capital’s new vaccination policy has been met with divided opinions on microblogging platform Weibo. Many proponents said they support the new rule, which they see as a broader public health measure. “It’s not compulsory, you make the decision about your body,” one Weibo user wrote. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, you can choose not to go to those places.” But some people argue that the policy could ultimately have a more restrictive effect than intended. “Other places may follow the example of Beijing in restricting the unvaccinated by not allowing them to work, go to school, go to the hospital, or take transport,” another Weibo user wrote.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010722
New Omicron Variant Triggers Weeklong Lockdown in Xi’an,The city’s infections are driven by the highly infectious BA.5.2 subvariant.,2022-07-07,"Xi’an announced a partial weeklong lockdown Wednesday after a highly transmissible subvariant of the coronavirus spiked cases in the northwestern city. The restrictions came as the city — which has 13 million residents — reported China’s first cases of a highly contagious Omicron subvariant. Authorities identified all of the city's cases as BA 5.2, a sublineage of the BA.5 variant, which according to experts, spreads faster than most of other circulating variants but appears to cause fewer hospitalizations and deaths. Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi province and known for its abundance of historic relics, has recorded 33 new infections since the weekend, according to local health authorities. Apart from Xi’an, the Chinese capital Beijing also identified its latest locally transmitted cases as BA.5.2 on Wednesday. The weeklong lockdown is the second such restriction in Xi’an following a citywide shutdown between December and January. Public places such as cinemas, gyms, bars, and wet markets have been shut for now, though restaurants could still offer take out and residents were free to move in and out of their residential compounds. Authorities announced that the city’s elementary, middle, and high schools would also start the summer holidays earlier than usual amid the fresh outbreak. Meanwhile, all local universities have been sealed off. As of Tuesday, authorities in Xi’an had quarantined 4,683 residents identified as contacts of infected people during citywide nucleic acid testing. Most of the infections have been traced to a local recycling trade market, where the first infection was identified Saturday. The first cases involving BA.5.2 reported in China have kept authorities on high alert, just as restrictions were being loosened in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The central government also relaxed quarantine requirements for inbound travelers, cutting it from 14 to seven days, along with three days of at-home health monitoring. China reported 338 COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, according to the country’s top health authority. The majority of the cases were in the eastern province of Anhui, parts of which are under lockdown due to the virus surge.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010721
Shanghai Job Ads Discriminate Against Applicants Who Had COVID,Some employers were found to be ruling out people once infected with the coronavirus or those who had worked at quarantine centers.,2022-07-05,"Some employers in Shanghai have been accused of not considering prospective workers with a history of COVID-19 infection, raising questions over discriminatory labor practises as the city tries to get back on track after a two-month lockdown. Job advertisements published by local recruitment agencies in Pudong New Area and Songjiang District showed that some employers restricted recovered COVID patients from applying for positions, local media reported Monday. Some recruitment notices also said volunteers who worked at temporary quarantine facilities, or fangcang, were also barred from applying. Zhang Hongtao, a Shanghai-based labor service agent, told Sixth Tone that the majority of local electronics and machinery factories refused to hire those who had recovered from COVID-19 for fear of reinfection. They believed such infections could potentially disrupt the entire factory’s production. “The factories clearly say they don’t hire those who previously tested positive — we can do nothing about it,” he said. “Even if some factories don’t mention that in recruitment requirements, they would turn them down, and we have to bring the workers back. It makes us feel awkward.” While some employers denied having such requirements, according to the local media report, agents like Zhang agreed that companies often make such demands. Sixth Tone’s request for comments to Aptiv, one of the manufacturers with such hiring restrictions in a job ad posted by Zhang, went unanswered by the time of publication. Even after two years into the pandemic, stigma against COVID patients still persists. Many patients shared that they had lost their jobs after recovering, though discrimination against people because of infectious diseases is illegal under Chinese law. Last month, an online post from a migrant worker who tested positive in April while working at a quarantine center in Shanghai but then struggled to either find a job in Shanghai or return to his hometown went viral. The man from the central Hubei province said he had to beg and live on the streets, and was “cold-shouldered like a rat.” “Companies may refuse to hire recovered COVID-19 patients to protect the health of other employees, but it’s discriminatory and violates the law,” said Chen Wenjin, a lawyer specializing in labor law at Shanghai Integrity Law Firm. “While workers can file complaints to regulators, the challenge is how to collect evidence proving employers don’t hire them due to their infection history. Some companies may cite other excuses or give no reason.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010699
COVID Cases From a Small County Spill to Other Chinese Cities,"While Sixian County has been locked down, major cities that reported spillover infections are without strict restrictions so far.",2022-07-04,"Just as China contained coronavirus outbreaks in bigger cities like Shanghai and Beijing, cases in a small county that have now spilled to other cities are once again challenging the country’s “zero-COVID” strategy. On Sunday, the eastern Anhui province reported 29 locally transmitted symptomatic and 258 asymptomatic cases — China doesn’t include the latter in its COVID-19 tally — with the majority of them in Sixian County, according to the provincial health commission. The county has recorded some 800 cases, most of them asymptomatic, since the first infection was diagnosed on June 26. Sixian County, home to 962,000 people, has shut highways and all indoor venues, including schools, restaurants, and supermarkets. A complete lockdown was imposed on June 29, with all residents requested to stay at home. Despite strict control measures, at least six cities in Anhui and the neighboring Jiangsu province, including Nanjing, have reported coronavirus cases directly related to the outbreak in Sixian County, according to media reports. Wuxi, a manufacturing hub nearly 400 kilometers away from Sixian County, has logged three confirmed local cases and 138 asymptomatic cases since June 29. Local authorities have ordered all restaurants to stop indoor dining, and shortened opening hours for banks and shopping malls, while residents leaving the city require proof of a negative COVID-19 test from within the past 48 hours. The outbreak in Anhui comes just about a month after neighboring Shanghai lifted its lockdown after curbing its worst COVID outbreak and when central authorities seem to be adjusting policies to minimize the economic impact. Last week, China halved the quarantine time for inbound passengers to seven days, along with three days of at-home health monitoring. Central authorities also removed a feature that identifies trips to at-risk areas from an app that shows an individual’s travel history, triggering a surge in online searches for hotels and flights. Many cities have also relaxed policies on COVID testing, extending the validity of test results to enter public venues. Days before Sixian County logged the first case, at least four big cities in Anhui had suspended such “normalized” tests required every two to three days.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010698
Chinese Cities Cautiously Welcome Travelers From Shanghai,Some cities have scrapped their quarantine policies for those arriving from Shanghai as COVID-19 cases wane and travel picks up.,2022-06-28,"Shanghai residents have mostly been prohibited from traveling freely domestically since the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted and infections began to wane. Now, with summer in full swing, a few places are welcoming them again, with increased precautions or more relaxed restrictions. In the neighboring province of Anhui, those arriving from “low-risk” areas in Shanghai will only need to monitor their health for seven days. Zhejiang province only requires those from residential complexes with COVID cases in the past 14 days to be quarantined after arriving. Twelve cities in another nearby province of Jiangsu, including Suzhou and Nanjing, have allowed people from low-risk areas to move around without restrictions. The sporadic COVID outbreaks have dealt a heavy blow to the country’s domestic tourism industry. Major national holidays during the spring — including the Labor Day holidays — were heavily disrupted due to heightened travel restrictions in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. On Thursday, the island province of Hainan allowed quarantine-free travel for most Shanghai residents. Only those from Minhang, Baoshan, and Jing’an districts, which are still deemed at-risk, are now required to self-isolate for three days after they arrive and take two nucleic acid tests during that period. The number of flight tickets to the resort town of Sanya increased by 93% last weekend compared with the previous one, according to data from travel booking site Qunar. Zhou, who lives in Pudong New Area, told Sixth Tone that he booked a Sanya vacation with his wife and daughter a day after learning about the new policy. The family only had to do a quick nucleic acid test at the airport and declare they hadn’t visited the so-called risky districts in Shanghai before leaving for their seafront hotel. “Compared to previous trips to Sanya, I was more perturbed before I departed,” said the 39-year-old who vacations in Sanya every year. “But I didn’t feel any difference after arriving at the airport. We could really leave the airport without any restrictions — it made me feel comfortable.”  The southwestern Sichuan province relaxed entry policies for people from low-risk areas in Shanghai from Monday. Cities in the province no longer require visitors from districts except Jing’an and Fengxian to undergo a seven-day home quarantine upon arrival.   The relaxed travel policies have appealed to tourists nationally, leading to a 26% rise in the search popularity of inbound flights to Chengdu on Monday compared to the same period last week, according to data from online travel operator Trip.com. In June, the number of flight tickets to Chengdu increased by nearly 50% from last month. The southern Guangdong province has also adopted fairly relaxed entry policies for those arriving from Shanghai, except those from Minhang, Baoshan, Fengxian, and Jing’an districts who are required to have seven days of health monitoring. Travel is gradually picking up as coronavirus infections decline nationally. China only reported one locally-transmitted symptomatic case for Monday, with none reported in Beijing and Shanghai. On Monday, the number of domestic flights across the country increased by about four times to 8,419 from a low period on April 4, according to civil aviation data provider VariFlight. Among them, 148 domestic flights took off or landed in Shanghai, compared to merely three daily flights in late April. Hotel bookings nationwide are also picking up, with the figure from the past weekend exceeding that from the same period in 2019, according to Qunar. Hotel bookings in the cities of Changsha and Haikou increased by 58% and 29%, respectively. Meanwhile, those still waiting to travel to other destinations that are yet to welcome Shanghai residents were seen rushing to nearby scenic spots for glamping and kayaking. On Tuesday, Shanghai Disneyland also said the theme park would resume operations with limited daily capacity from Thursday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010650
The Tables Carrying the Weight of China’s COVID-19 Testing,Photographer Wu Chenghuan documents the numerous tables used for nucleic acid tests in Xi’an.,2022-06-23,"The recent COVID-19 outbreaks in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing reminded me of the lockdown during the virus flare-up in Xi’an where I live. During the lockdown, which lasted for just over a month, I queued for 23 rounds of nucleic acid tests alongside 10,000 other residents in my compound. We stood in the cold northwest winter, slowly making our way toward medical workers in white hazmat suits sat behind a table. I started photographing tables mostly because there are so many different types and they attracted my attention. Some tables reminded me of pre-COVID times when they had a more utilitarian purpose — study tables, foldable work tables, and those set up in gardens — and others made by putting a wooden board over a stool were just as functional. The tables are less visible these days, as COVID testing has mostly moved to streetside kiosks. But through my images, I wanted to remember the purpose these tables served during the COVID outbreaks.

Shanghai-Kunshan Commuters Face Hurdles as Travel Curbs Relaxed,"Over 60,000 people make the inter-city journey on a daily basis.",2022-06-22,"When Wang Shimin purchased his apartment in Shanghai’s neighboring city Kunshan a few years ago, he enjoyed its cheaper cost of housing and the convenient metro ride to his office in Shanghai’s Hongkou District. “But it’s complicated now, and I feel like I’ve been tricked,” he said Tuesday. Many people like Wang commute to Shanghai for work from Kunshan in Jiangsu province using a subway line connecting the two. But the two-month lockdown and strict travel policies even after the restrictions were lifted have made the journey arduous for the more than 60,000 commuters who travel between the two cities on a daily basis. Starting Monday morning, those with fixed residences or work units in Kunshan were allowed to commute to and from Shanghai without any quarantines. Commuters must apply for the Shanghai-Kunshan commuting pass after submitting several documents with personal information and a 24-hour negative nucleic acid test certificate. Government data shows that over 6,000 employees from 190 key industrial enterprises in the Anting area of Shanghai’s Jiading District alone have inter-city commutes. Wang said he applied for the commuter pass on Sunday afternoon and managed to return home to Kunshan Monday evening. But commuting hasn’t been easy. The Shanghai-Kunshan pass is only valid for 24 hours and commuters must upload a negative nucleic acid test certificate to the city service app every day. The three subway stations in Kunshan that provide links to Shanghai suspended operations in mid-February and remain closed as of publication. Many commuters are now required to go to the nearest subway station in Anting. On Tuesday, Wang biked about 6 kilometers from his home to Anting’s station. After getting off, he immediately took a COVID-19 test near his office, even though his results hadn’t expired. After the travel policies were relatively relaxed, Yin Zhiyang also tried to return home to Kunshan. The 26-year-old said he came to the office on June 9 and had stayed in a hotel arranged by the company since then. On Monday evening, Yin drove from the hotel to Anting only to find a long queue at the station. By the time he would get through the checkpoint to enter Kunshan, his COVID test result would have already expired. So he returned to the hotel. Teresa Gong, another Kunshan resident, said she wasn’t rushing to return to her office in Shanghai and would wait until July. “The procedure is too troublesome,” she said. “After all, I can work online. I’m not in a hurry to go back.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010612

"As COVID Lingers: Extract, Test, Seal. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat","Burdened with unending nucleic acid tests, lab workers are stretched to the limit.",2022-06-18,"23:17:01. The time blinked on the screen at the hotel entrance opposite the lab Xiaozhou was posted at. On that late night in May, she pulled out her phone and took a photo of the flashing red clock. She had just documented the end of another long workday in a county-level city in the eastern Jiangsu province. Xiaozhou had just spent over eight hours at a PCR lab. The monotony was mind numbing. Stretching out her arm, Xiaozhou picked up a test tube, unscrewed the cap, and used a pipette in her other hand to transfer the sample into a small well less than 7 mm in diameter on the reaction plate. Then repeat — several thousand times. “I’m an emotionless sample-testing machine,” she says.  As a nucleic acid tester reassigned from her township to support the city, she was overwhelmed: on that day in May alone, the lab had received 232 batches of test samples — that’s more than 20,000 tubes. Across the region, Xiaozhou isn’t alone. Almost every nucleic acid tester interviewed described their current mood with the same refrain: “assembly line.” They see themselves as the new line workers — from collecting samples to dispensing reagents, testing, and applying films, nucleic acid testing is a labor-intensive process with low levels of automation. Xiaozhou’s city, like many others, implemented a “normalized” testing plan. Each time it was enforced, the city carried out roughly 220,000 tests, generating over 100,000 sample tubes. Since travel resumed, the number of people returning from out of town skyrocketed, and with them, so did the number of samples required. But the county-level city comprised just six qualified laboratories, including two large nucleic acid testing bases, two tertiary-grade hospital labs, and two township hospital labs. According to Xiaozhou, professional testers are in short supply, totaling only about 120 staff. So she was temporarily transferred from her job in the township hospital lab — her third such transfer this year already. Such reinforcement personnel are put under closed-loop management, entailing collective quarantining with daily testing. After late night shifts, they stay at a hotel, often a 10-minute walk away. Amid the new COVID-19 wave, comprehensive nucleic acid testing is more widespread than ever, resulting in the rapid expansion of third-party testing facilities and attractive job postings circulating online. But in smaller cities and the vast countryside, the heavy burden of testing falls on the shoulders of public hospitals, and, in particular, their lab workers, who toil under pressure for low salaries and paltry benefits.  Sample fatigue Xiaozhou, 22, joined the hospital just a year ago. In college, her parents pushed her to opt for medicine, but she resisted because she was not a fan of all the gore. She was eventually talked into medical lab science. After graduating, she would most likely work with the “three usuals” — blood, urine, and stool samples — in what would be a more tranquil job. But by the time she graduated last year, the pandemic had not only multiplied the lab’s workload but Xiaozhou also found herself on the frontline of the battle against the pandemic. With only eight people, her lab is now the most strained department in the entire hospital. But they aren’t the only ones; almost all hospitals are in the same boat. Xiaozhou says that in township hospitals without labs, the department only leaves one person in charge of the outpatient clinic and transfers everyone else to the city. Working hours are divided into tight schedules. This past spring came and went without her realizing the change in weather, and she has hardly taken any time off since March. On her birthday, her mother sent food to the hospital for her, but Xiaozhou could only wolf it down quickly before rushing back to work. Her birthday wish was simple: that the pandemic would end soon. After clocking out and returning to her room in the hotel next door, Xiaozhou felt like she reeked like a moldy can of meat. Her arms were so sore she could barely lift them, and her fingers were full of blisters from twisting caps off. Left so exhausted that she had no desire to wash her hair, she planned to tie it up the next day and tamp it down with a hat. She prayed she could get off early because she had to go back to her office to catch an 8 a.m. shift the day after.  Stress test Contrary to popular belief, most aspects of testing rely on manual labor, and not automation. Testers repeat the same, dull work every day — in other words, an assembly line. Broadly speaking, PCR labs can be divided into three clear stages that encompass the entire chain, from collecting samples all the way through to uploading digital results. Most use a shift system that keeps the lab running 24 hours a day. The first stage deals with the reagent configuration, and is mostly done manually. Based on the number of samples projected that day, the technicians assess the amount of reagents needed and prepare them in advance. The actual samples go directly to the second section, which thus runs the highest risk of infection. Testers must wear airtight protective suits while carefully repeating the same steps: extract, test, and seal. This is widely recognized as the most strenuous part of the process. Automation appears only in the final stage. The tester puts samples into the amplification equipment and then waits for over an hour to determine whether they are positive based on the reaction curve the machine generates. The test results are then uploaded. A senior lab worker with two decades of experience says that if the result of a pooled testing tube — samples from several people together — returned positive, they would need to be reviewed in the lab first. Positive results are then reported to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further review. Next, individual tests are administered to people in this pool to pinpoint those actually infected. Such a review process is meant to avoid false positives. To alleviate the stress and break the monotony, some labs pooled money for an annual subscription to music platforms. But it’s hard to hear the music over the drone of all the equipment.  “You can’t afford to get too distracted, either,” says one Zhejiang-based tester. If your focus slips even a bit and you add the sample to the wrong well with the pipette, the whole plate will have to be junked, and the process must start from scratch. Stress intensifies even more during the holidays. In nearly every city, people have had to take nucleic acid tests before traveling out, leaving labs with up to twice as many samples to handle. The testers have to keep tabs, by hand, every day: when samples were taken, when they were delivered to the lab, and the latest by which they require the results. Outside the lab sits one staff member dedicated solely to watching the time, and uses the intercom to issue reminders about the upcoming deadline on a batch of tests. If a deadline is missed, the delay is noted, and then criticized by higher-ups.  Diminishing returns Nobody is beyond the call of duty: neither newcomers, nor even the pregnant or employees about to retire. Xiaozhou’s body was signaling change. She noticed pimples on her nose for the first time, and her period grew irregular. Her work and eating routine was completely upended. Time in the lab dulled her senses, keeping her from feeling hunger until she walked outside, and late nights became the norm. And fatigue could strike anytime. Once, she was in charge of unscrewing the caps while a colleague worked the pipette. They clearly sensed that her movements had slowed, and when they looked again after a while, she was leaning against the glass of the biosafety cabinet, fast asleep. She believes she has mastered the skill of sitting while sleeping. “You just fold your arms in, like sleeping in class,” she says. “Now I even dream about testing samples or drawing blood.” According to data from the National Health Commission (NHC), China now has about 150,000 nucleic acid testing technicians nationwide. Compared to what is required for normalized testing, that’s not nearly enough. Almost every lab worker interviewed at a public hospital underscored that their department was struggling to recruit testers. Plus, PCR certification requires applicants to have completed a medicine-related major and pass the NHC’s training. It’s a considerable threshold. One lab worker says that the offer is frankly not that appealing, given the limited number of bianzhi — official, full-time positions similar to tenure — and the middling compensation package.  Given the shortage of manpower and time constraints, one senior technician at a county public hospital bluntly says, “There are times we just can’t do it to the right standards.” This was the technician’s eighth year in a profession she had enjoyed since college, but now, she thinks every day about quitting. “I’m exhausted,” she says. “My hands shake every day after I get off work.” The high wages and benefits of nucleic acid testers made headlines some time ago; Xiaozhou explains that those are third-party facility offers, however, and that most testers were public hospital personnel like her, earning a subsidized 50 yuan ($7.50) per day of testing. At one public hospital lab in Jinhua, a city in the eastern Zhejiang province, Yiran says she wasn’t paid even that 50 yuan. With accumulated work experience of 20 years, she spoke of a policy in 2020 that provided subsidies to frontline workers. But then she and her coworkers found that lab technicians and the outdoor test collectors were ineligible, as “frontline” referred only to medical staff in direct contact with confirmed patients. Moreover, the pandemic has in turn affected the hospital’s daily intake, leading to a de-facto decline in the overall performance of its laboratory department. At the local level, nucleic acid tests are a loss-making venture. “There’s no profit at all,” rues Yiran. The director of the lab department at a public hospital concluded that these tests have turned into an endeavor with no returns. It has left Yiran feeling exploited. Medical lab science was supposed to bridge clinical medicine and basic medicine, a job where experience can improve liver and kidney function tests, or the more difficult tumor markers and cell testing. Nucleic acid testing, on the other hand, involves a very low degree of specialization and is just plain tedious. Xiaochen, a nurse in Shanghai’s Fengxian District, refuses to become a “sampling machine.” Instead, her approach is to treat people coming for tests as individuals. When she encounters a child, she praises them with a grin. During breaks, she lets her mind wander. Both samplers and testers want this state of mechanical work to end sooner and return to a more professional and fulfilling job.  Besieged Unlike these public hospital labs, third-party nucleic acid testing facilities have dramatically gained ground. Xiaoli, who works at a prefecture-level public hospital, was initially excited when she saw a job posting at a Shanghai facility for 1,800 yuan a day. But she knew it meant longer working hours, more intense and repetitive labor, and having to make it solo in the big city. She passed it up, for now. A woman who worked part-time as a nucleic acid sampler in Shanghai recently understood what it meant to pay the piper. The price offered in the job posting did not come in full, nor did the promised meal allowance. She was fired a few days ago and nobody explained why. As competition intensifies in the testing market, some institutions have begun falsifying and violating the rules, which in turn placed a new burden on public hospitals. Out of distrust of third-party agencies, Xiaoli’s city started sending more samples to public hospitals. The heightened pressure eventually resulted in two of her colleagues opting to switch to administrative work. Meanwhile, 23-year-old Chen Yu decided instead to join the frontline. After majoring in nursing, she successfully became a nurse following graduation and worked in a hospital for two years. Early this year, she saw a CDC recruitment ad in Jinan, capital of the eastern Shandong province, for nucleic acid testers. Anybody with a medical background could take the recruitment test and be posted upon passing training. “Competition was fierce,” says Chen. Of the 100-plus applicants, only 20 were ultimately selected, including her. In addition to enjoying bianzhi, they work out of a newly constructed fangcang, or shelter hospital. The staff come from a range of backgrounds, from nursing to biosafety technology, and they are all young, with the youngest recruit aged 22. When she started in April, this fangcang, located in a patch of undeveloped land downtown, was only half-built. Though now completed with an isolated testing area, separate offices, bathrooms, laundry room, and a break room, it still can’t shake off the appearance of a temporary structure.  For her, it is better than the hospital. Back in her nursing days, having to deal with people was like being set adrift, never knowing where the next conflict or turmoil might arise. “I felt drained every day,” she says. She prefers what she does today, sitting on a stool in front of the biosafety cabinet. “The assembly line is easy, and there’s no chance of conflicts erupting between medical staff and other people,” she says. The mechanical repetition lent her a sense of security. She heads into the fangcang everyday at 7:30 a.m. and emerges at 12:30 p.m.; a second group works until 6:30 p.m. Then she goes back in, from 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Chen had just worked four days the week before this interview, and she says she wasn’t feeling too tired. Thanks to her bianzhi, she feels confident in her ability to get another post within the system, if and when the pandemic ends and testing stops. She heard that the CDC lab department used to work on infectious diseases like AIDS, so she figured people like her would likely do that as well. At meetings, managers spoke of a bright future: They might accept contracts for samples from other districts and counties to turn a profit. It will be a very promising and important project for the district. Chen was sold. Like the new fangcang, her future may well be bright and tangible as well.

Freight or Flight: COVID Wake Leaves Shanghai’s Port High and Dry,"Though some restrictions have been lifted, container ship schedules remain unstable.",2022-06-15,"On May 25, Shanghai’s Jinshan District announced the removal of traffic checkpoints across its various towns and sub-districts. On hearing the news, Li Ting, who until that point was locked up in her clothing export and trade company, drove immediately to the nearest customs office. Driving through the jampacked roads, she momentarily felt “everything had gone back to normal,” until she remembered that citywide restrictions were still in effect and she couldn’t get back to her home located in another district. But at the time, the customs paperwork was more important. She needed to get it done and sent to clients overseas. Two months after the lockdown in Shanghai, her company’s operations were slowly limping back to normal — Li did not want to lose momentum. And with no paperwork being dispatched, deliveries not coming through, and some overseas clients’ shipments unable to clear customs on time, Li knew it was an uphill battle. Such was the backlog since the COVID-19 outbreak began in Shanghai in March that stranded cargo ships besieged the city port in a semicircle. Though the lifting of restrictions came as a relief, ship schedules are still quite unstable. And for two years now, ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, factories, facing untenable delays, clients demanding discounts for future orders, and restless factory workers, are yet to return to full operations.  The long haul Shanghai is home to the world’s largest port. In 2021, its throughput surpassed 47 million standard shipping containers: the twelfth consecutive year that it ranked first. But on May 11 this year, China’s Ministry of Transport revealed that April saw just 3.085 million standard containers — a 17.6% drop compared with the same period last year. Over the past two years, entrepreneurs were forced to queue up ahead of time at nearby container yards when ports were shut, and then waitlist the cargo until they could be weighed and taken out to sea. If they just waited for ports to give them the green light before queuing up, they could have ended up either missing the ship, or having their containers rejected due to last-minute glitches.  Shen Qiang is a proxy handling customs logistics on Li’s behalf. He says that, during the lockdown, yards near the port got even more crowded, with containers often stranded for several days — something he only saw during the hectic Spring Festival period. Naturally, finding available yard space became a top priority, and a hassle. Some restricted the hours that large trucks could ply, leading to long jams. On one occasion, Li’s containers had only just been accepted, when they were notified that all yards had to take turns shutting down for three days. Her goods were, thus, left in limbo. Hoping to get them back out as soon as possible, Shen quickly contacted Li to ask if she had a backup plan. But at the same time, he worried that, wherever they moved, the shutdowns would just repeat ad nauseam. They ended up choosing to stay put. Already under the strain of countless backed-up orders, Li’s assembly line was stretched to the limit. She provided her employees, whose lives were essentially restricted to the factory grounds, with bed and board. Only early in April, when lockdown measures were at their most stringent, did they finally cease all production. She recalls that when production gradually resumed, the biggest problem was to get travel passes for trucks ferrying raw materials. Through contacts in the logistics network, Li got in touch with some vehicles that had passes to deliver lockdown supplies. After they completed their designated tasks for the day, they brought over some raw materials for her in what was a side hustle of sorts. But under-the-table odd jobs like this came at a steep price — Li’s overhead expenses surged. Moreover, regular trips that cost 3,000-4,000 yuan ($447-$600) began billing for over 10,000 yuan. The numbers gave her a headache. On May 26, her factory still wasn’t fully operational. One of the machines broke down, and spare parts were stuck in an industrial park in another district. She had no choice but to wait until the lockdown had been lifted citywide. Industrial parks function basically like residential communities. Every factory fretted about food: the quality of group-bought supplies was deemed subpar, so many instead depended on nearby villages. In private, they grumbled about the lack of work and the nonstop, mandatory nucleic acid tests. The designated testing site was two or three kilometres away from the premises. Every factory had to categorize their production zones from low to high risk — employees in “high-risk” zones were required to do daily tests. Early in May, Jinshan District, an industrial powerhouse in Shanghai, announced a new measure on their pandemic prevention app: if registered employees failed to comply with testing plans, there’d be a warning. Li says that, on the factory floor, low-level cadres adopted a softer tone with floor managers, almost pleading, “please do it on time.”  The math For factories, whether or not to ship cargo amid the lockdown is a mathematical tour de force comprising several variables. On top of the unstable sailing dates, long waits at the port, and the risk of missing out at the last minute, the entire journey is fraught with difficulties. Another freight logistics proxy, Liu Zhan, recalls that, from mid-April to May, trucks driving to the neighboring Jiangsu Province to pick up goods always had trouble exiting the expressway. It meant he’d get grief from all around: drivers felt the long and uncertain delays had to be reimbursed, while factories constantly asked him to hurry the drivers up. Most of the time, he had little influence over traffic authorities and on-site factory security personnel. All he could do was wait. After doling out the extra overheads, factories also have to take a hard look at how much goodwill they had left with their clients. Such things are often difficult to ascertain and they therefore take precautions. A former technician at Li’s factory messaged someone at her facility that one of Li’s clients had begun ordering from the technician’s new employer. “I can only speculate but perhaps this client was not satisfied with online product inspection alone and preferred an in-person inspection, which the rules forbid,” says Li.  “For the moment, all I can say is that I hope to reel them back in after the pandemic,” says Li. From now on, she just wants to focus on production two to three months ahead — anything long-term is just too frustrating. At the end of last year, she had actually made a plan for 2022 — it did little good. Liu Zhan learned that in early May, it cost at least 1,000 yuan more per truck to divert cargo from Shanghai to the port of Ningbo, about 90 nautical miles away. Getting a container into Shanghai cost 50-80% more than usual.  Who foots the bill? In stark contrast to exporters like Li, importers hope the container ships take their own sweet time drifting in. Chen Kan works at an international trade company, helping domestic clients import into Shanghai. He says containers have piled up at the docks. With deliveries of bills of lading — a legal document issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo — on indefinite hold, and company seals locked away in offices, nobody could collect their imports. After some time, shipping companies that temporarily held on to them often demanded demurrage fees. Having been there a few times, Chen has developed certain insights. Some shipping companies are more reasonable and might waive the fee, while others turn a blind eye. Digitizing bills of lading proved complex too: without a hard copy, some shipping companies require multiple written guarantees and additional fees; others demand large sums of security deposits. In the end, many clients chose to “lie down” — that is, forget about collecting during lockdown. Chen says, “During the pandemic, ships are like futures — everyone bets on the chances of the outbreak coming under control by the time the goods arrive.” For the sake of his clients, he hopes that they go slow.  He jokes that the past two years have “put [his] skills to the test.” However, he promptly adds: “With some things, you either luck in, or luck out.” Now, he needs plans for all sorts of contingencies. If the port is too overcrowded and you need air freight, then the land routes also need to change. If new cases are detected at your airline or airport, then planes are grounded and nothing gets in or out. Every option is risky — including the backups. Budget readjustments never stop, down to the time spent disinfecting goods at ports. He rarely sleeps well these days. If he makes a mistake that causes a client’s production to halt, he’ll have to face their wrath, and dole out compensation. He’s been lobbying everyone to convert to digital bills of lading, but some of his colleagues don’t feel the same sense of urgency. With Shanghai’s delivery services slated to resume operations, they are confident it’ll get back to business as usual. However, after two years of extreme uncertainty, Chen just wants to rest. On May 29, the city government announced policies stabilizing foreign trade, such as offering increased export tax rebates and short-term credit insurances, as well as encouraging shipping companies to reduce fees for container storage and oversight. Whether it will help stabilize foreign trade, shipping, and manufacturing remains to be seen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010561
China’s ‘Zero-COVID’ Policy: A View From the Border,"Ruili boomed in the 2010s thanks to its close proximity to Myanmar and the jade trade. Then the pandemic came, and the city found itself cut off, not just from the border, but also the rest of China.",2022-06-13,"As China struggles to contain multiple new outbreaks of COVID-19, observers have naturally focused on the large-scale lockdowns being implemented in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing. But nowhere has been harder hit by COVID-19 quarantines than the country’s border regions. But arguably nowhere has been harder hit by COVID-19 quarantines than the southwestern border town of Ruili. Prior to the pandemic, Ruili’s economy was built around the cross-border jade trade. Its proximity to the border attracted jade cutters and sellers from across China, as well as laborers and merchants from Myanmar. Unlike the more established jade industry in Guangdong, commerce in Ruili was dominated by small- or medium-sized enterprises and individual merchants who made frequent trips across the border in search of high-quality jade for their networks of clients. I’ve made 10 fieldwork trips to the city over the past half-decade and know many of its merchants well. This February, as Ruili’s jade markets finally reopened after a year and a half of inactivity, I decided to see for myself how life there had changed during the pandemic. The crowds of shoppers that once clogged its streets are gone, and many of the merchants I knew have left for greener pastures. A few of them are already trickling back. Starting afresh in a new city is not easy for members of China’s insular, network-dependent jade industry. One of my long-time research participants, Meng, moved to Ruili from Beijing in 2010, just as sales in the city were taking off. Arriving with little more than 100,000 yuan ($14,800) in start-up cash and a dream of hitting the big time, the couple spent the next eight years building a successful jade trading business. By 2020, they had bought a house in the city, and both of their sons were studying in nearby schools. The pandemic took them by surprise. When I asked them what they thought about Ruili’s markets reopening, they seemed to care more about what the new rules might mean for freedom of movement: They had not seen their eldest son, a middle-school student in the nearby city of Mangshi, in almost a year. “If the markets are reopening, that gives me hope that lockdown will soon be lifted,” Meng said. Due to their proximity to the border, Ruili residents have spent nearly two years living under some of the most stringent pandemic prevention measures in the country. Ruili first locked down in September 2020, after two Myanmar citizens who had illegally crossed into China tested positive for COVID-19. More lockdowns followed. The current order has been in place since July 2021. The impact on the jade industry, which depended on a constant flow of people and goods between China and Myanmar, was devastating. Many merchants and carvers lost their only source of income overnight. In April 2021, 353,000 people were taking part in the city’s mandatory COVID-19 testing program; by July, this figure had dropped to 238,000. While numbers fluctuate, this suggests as many as 115,000 people left the city in the space of just a few months. For some in the jade industry, however, leaving can be costlier than digging in. There’s a waiting list to get out of the city, and those who do make the list are often required to undergo lengthy quarantines — at their own expense — once they arrive at their destination. Once there, they can struggle to find a market for the skills they honed in Ruili’s jade industry. Ma, who made a living in Ruili as a jade livestreamer, said he jumped for joy when he learned that he could finally leave the city. But when he returned to his hometown in the central Henan province, he was unable to find a job to his liking. “I lived in Ruili for six years; most of my friends and connections are there,” he said. “And with the pandemic, business is difficult everywhere. The only difference is that I’m a little freer at home.” He plans to go back to Ruili after its lockdown is completely lifted. Chen, who has been in the jade industry for 30 years and is fluent in Burmese, had a similar experience. She worked her way up the ranks in Ruili to become one of the city’s most successful sellers of high-quality jadeite ring gemstones. She transferred her business to Guangdong during the pandemic, but had a hard time adapting to the region’s business culture. “In Guangdong, people have their own rules for doing business as well as their own factions,” she said. “How can we possibly compete? What’s more, it’s all large companies. A few have already monopolized the market. There’s no room for us (individual traders).” The city’s Burmese traders have fared no better. Those who had to leave Ruili and return across the border were often forced to pay various “road tolls” by northern militias. The majority decided to liquidate their inventories in the city before returning to their home country. Meng’s business has survived in part because she was able to acquire large stocks of uncut jadeite from Burmese traders, who pay her a commission to sell the stones to vendors in Guangdong like Chen. For Meng and many others who once had high hopes for life in Ruili, making ends meet in a now-stagnating economy is only part of the challenge. The lockdown’s impact on everyday life has been overwhelming. Meng’s eldest son is gearing up for his crucial high school entrance exams while completely cut off from his family. “One day, he called me up in tears and said he wanted to come home and eat the noodles I make,” Meng recalled. “I couldn’t stop crying.… All I could do was reassure him that it’d eventually be over. But I don’t know when ‘eventually’ will be.”  Meanwhile, although her younger son is still by her side, she worries that if anyone tests positive at the jade market, she and her husband will be sent to centralized quarantine, leaving their 7-year-old with no one to care for him. Meng doesn’t dare leave the house whenever the city reports new cases — instead, she sends her husband to make pick-ups and shipments. Meng’s family isn’t her only concern. During her time in Ruili, she became close with a Burmese trader, Aw, who worked at the counter next to hers and used to be her neighbor back when Meng’s family was living in a rental home. The two have known each other for many years and are on very good terms. After the pandemic broke out, Aw was forced to return to Myanmar when her husband’s exit-entry permit expired. “She’s the closest friend I’ve made in all the years I’ve spent in Ruili,” Meng said. “Now that she’s left, I don’t know who I can turn to when our family needs help.” After Ruili’s jade markets reopened, some of the livestreamers and traders who had relocated to other cities, including Chen, returned to the city. The outbreaks haven’t stopped, but the residents I spoke to seem to take them stride. It’s become popular to joke that, “Nowhere else in China can you get a COVID-19 swab more authentic than the ones in Ruili.” As long as the markets remain open, all the city’s merchants can do is put on a mask, open their stalls, and wait and see if their city can recover its former glory.

"In Locked Down Shanghai, a ‘Shadow Pandemic’ of Domestic Violence","China’s Anti-Domestic Violence Law has been on the books since 2016, but the protections it offers abuse victims have proven fragile during lockdowns.",2022-06-09,"One night, about 10 days into the Shanghai lockdown, I was startled by the loud thud of something heavy hitting the floor above me. When I opened my window, I heard a man yelling, the sound of someone being slapped, and a woman in tears. As a domestic violence volunteer, I knew what was happening. I also knew how hard it would be to intervene. Getting abuse victims the help and protection they need is challenging enough even in the best of times; doing so in the middle of a lockdown is a nightmare. Our first priority is moving the victim to a safe location, but this seemingly straightforward task is made nearly impossible by quarantine rules that restrict movement and forbid residents from leaving their apartments. Victims are effectively trapped under the same roof with their abusers. Still, I had to try. I called the police, told the officer who picked up what I had heard, and asked them to send someone immediately. “How do you expect us to intervene?” he replied. “We can’t enter your building because of the COVID-19 restrictions.” He said he would call my neighborhood committee and ask them to check on the situation, then hung up the phone. I messaged a member of the committee myself, asking them to check on the woman, but received no reply. “The police were just pushing their responsibility onto us,” she wrote back the next morning. “Of course they can enter the complex.” In the end, no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised. This is my third year serving as a domestic violence volunteer in Shanghai. In that role, I work with victims as they go through the protracted and often painful process of seeking protection and justice from a system that still treats spousal abuse as a “family matter.”  Faced with official inaction, I decided to do what I could on my own. This was easier said than done. My first task was to find her. I’d only just moved into the building a few months prior. Like most Shanghai residents before the lockdown, I barely knew my neighbors. Still, I kept my eye out, until one day I saw someone returning to our building who seemed to fit the profile. I opened cautiously, asking her if she’d heard any strange noises recently. “Oh, that was probably me,” she replied, seeming surprised. She told me not to worry and that it was just a couple of fights. I told her she could come to my apartment if she ever needed a safe place to stay. Making contact with a potential victim is something we’re taught to do as domestic violence volunteers, as it reminds victims that they can seek assistance from others. On the night of May 19, about five weeks after the first assault, I heard a loud noise like furniture being smashed on the floor, then a woman’s voice: “Help! Help! My husband is beating me!” I rushed upstairs, where I found the woman sitting on the floor, hurt and unable to stand. I returned to my own floor and called the police again. This time I stressed that the woman needed medical care. It’s another strategy we are taught: By highlighting the seriousness of the situation, it’s easier to persuade the police that the case is more than just a “lover’s quarrel.”  After the officer on duty repeatedly confirmed with me that there were no positive COVID-19 cases in our building, two police officers, clad head to toe in hazmat suits, showed up at the couple’s door. One of the officers asked what had happened. The woman said she had been beaten; the man countered that she had scratched him. The officer asked if they wanted the police to “resolve” the matter. “How?” the woman asked. “Oh, by detaining both of you!” the officer replied. The mention of detention clearly frightened the woman. Possibly, she never imagined that the victim might also be punished. She said that wouldn’t be necessary, then asked whether the officers could bring her to a shelter or help her buy a new phone — her old one had been destroyed by her husband. That request, of course, was turned down. “Just put up with it and wait until Shanghai lifts the lockdown,” the officer said. Before they left, they checked the couple’s ID cards and health codes. The whole process took less than 10 minutes. My neighbor is far from an isolated case. UN Women has called domestic violence “the shadow pandemic,” and domestic violence rates have spiked around the world over the past few years. The group found that over 50 countries had integrated the prevention of violence against women and girls into their COVID-19 plans, while 150 countries have adopted measures to strengthen services for women survivors of violence during the pandemic. China’s Anti-Domestic Violence Law has been in effect since 2016, but I am not aware of any new national-level measures taken specifically in response to the pandemic. Instead, the country’s strict lockdown and quarantine restrictions often work to sever victims from the protections and services theoretically available to them. The police, the All-China Women’s Federation, the shelter system — all have struggled to perform their responsibilities under the Anti-Domestic Violence Law. In the two months Shanghai was under lockdown, the group I volunteer with received over 10 requests for help from victims of domestic violence — roughly three times our usual caseload. One of them came from a woman in her fifties who was being beaten by her ex-husband. Prior to the lockdown, she and her daughter had been about to move out. But then the lockdown started, and the violence escalated. She called the police, but they told her the same thing they told me: They couldn’t come because of COVID-19 restrictions. She then begged her neighborhood committee for help, hoping they would at least let her move in with her sister or mom, but the quarantine rules would make no exceptions. Finally, she ran out into her compound garden. It was cold and rainy, but she told me she felt safer in the elements than with her ex. She spent hours outside, huddled in a pavilion under the incredulous eyes of her neighbors, until the property manager took pity on her and said she and her daughter could stay the night in the compound office. In the meantime, I was trying to contact the local All-China Women’s Federation chapter – the government body responsible for helping victims under the Anti-Domestic Violence Law. No one answered. I was told later that the officials in charge of answering the phones were quarantined at home. I then tried the national Women’s Rights Protection hotline, which is run by the AWF. The woman who picked up said it was the fourth domestic violence call she’d answered that afternoon. “It’s not like domestic violence gets you out of quarantine,” she said. “Why do these women want to create trouble with men when they know this is a difficult time … Have they thought about why they’re being beaten?”  The domestic violence shelter I contacted — another system set up under the auspices of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law — was equally unhelpful. They told me the shelter had been repurposed to house people with nowhere else to go during the quarantine. Running out of options, my fellow volunteers and I used our personal connections to reach an official from the local AWF chapter. After a few hours, we were told that the officials, together with the police, had agreed to take the woman and her daughter to a hotel. “It was the best night’s sleep I’ve ever had!” she wrote to us the next day. As a volunteer, I’ll often get questions like: Why don’t victims call the police? Why don’t they run away? But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the system can make getting help seem harder than simply putting up with the violence. During the lockdown, I worked with an injured woman who, unable to find transportation, had to walk home for half an hour from the hospital at 2 a.m. I counseled a woman who waited helplessly for the police to intervene and stop the abuse, but was rejected. For many of the women who contact us, seeking help is so difficult that staying with their abuser can seem like the more “reasonable” choice. Some of them, like the mother in her 50s, we were able to move to safety. My upstairs neighbor was not so lucky. All I can do is keep trying, keep applying pressure on the people responsible to do their jobs — and pray my ceiling doesn’t make a sound again.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010484
What Does it Cost to Test China for COVID-19?,"China now requires COVID tests every two or three days in major cities. How many people, and test sites, will it need to make PCR testing as routine as buying fruit?",2022-06-09,"As China moves on from an Omicron outbreak that disrupted life in many major cities, it’s leaving behind a new routine: near-daily PCR testing. Across China, major cities are requiring people to test every 48 or 72 hours in order to go to work, shop, or get on public transport. It’s part of the country’s strategy to achieve “zero-COVID” without cratering the economy. First launched in Hangzhou and Shenzhen in March, the system is now in place in nearly 20 major cities. With hundreds of millions of people seeking tests a few times a week, wait times can get very long. In Shanghai’s first week, many people have reported spending an hour or more lining up. If these lines are going to get under control, cities will need a lot of new test kiosks. That’s a huge new system. We wanted to know just how big — how many test sites does the country need, how many people need to staff them, and how much will it cost? Based on publicly available information, we’ve made some estimates. How many test sites? Question one: how many test sites does each city need? Most major cities in the country now require a 48-hour COVID-19 test to enter public places, even if they do not require everyone to be tested every two days. While some cities — including Shanghai, China’s largest city — have a looser 72-hour requirement, we’ll use the more common 48-hour figure for our estimate.  The National Health Commission estimates that a city needs at least one test site for every 2,000 to 3,000 people. So we divided the population of a city by 3,000 to get a bare minimum, and by 2,000 for a high-end estimate.   So far, only six cities have met the health authority’s standard, with Beijing farthest from the target and Hangzhou way above the recommended minimum. The Hangzhou Health Commission said Hangzhou sets sampling points according to a “1530” standard: anyone should be able to walk to the test site within 15 minutes, and wait for no more than 30 minutes. Shenzhen and the southwestern city of Nanning also follow that standard. The outcome is that Beijing often has long waiting lines at test sites but Hangzhou doesn’t, according to people living in the two cities.  How many people? Cities also need people to do the tests. The vast majority of COVID-19 test sites are only open for three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, although each city offers a few 24-hour test points. The National Health Commission estimates that one tester works six hours a day and can test 60 people per hour. That allows us to estimate how many people it would take to test a city’s whole population in 48 hours. The numbers we get are huge: China’s largest cities could need over 100,000 full-time testing workers. In the typical city, it works out to about 30% of all doctors and nurses, and over half in Nanning. To make this possible, China’s relaxed rules that required tests to be administered by licensed medical professionals. At a press conference on May 13, the National Health Commission encouraged big cities across the county to hire more “personnel with health-related professional qualifications.” Most cities have hired tens of thousands of temporary workers, paying about 200 yuan an hour ($30), according to recruitment platform Liepin.  How much does it cost? The costs of test kiosks is also pretty high. In addition to the building materials, each needs tens of thousands of yuan of equipment such as air filtration systems, cold storage, UV lamps, cell phones, and computers. There are three types of test site: those that are located in the hospital and cost nothing to set up, kiosks that cost between 10,000 and 50,000 yuan each, and mobile testing vehicles that cost between 100,000 and 250,000 yuan each. The overwhelming majority of test sites are likely to be kiosks. According to our research, hospital-based testing sites in all cities account for 20% of the city’s needs. Therefore, around 80% of the test points need to be newly built. Mobile test sites are very rare, so we were able to remove them from our analysis. We estimate it will cost a total of 2.1 billion yuan to build 84,661 new test sites across the country.   Finally, cities will need to buy testing materials. The main cost is nucleic acid reagents, which cost 5.7 yuan per test tube. Many cities use pool testing of 10 people in most testing, so we’re assuming one test per 10 people. The estimated total cost doesn’t take into account the cost of processing the results by the testing labs, as the cost is not available. The total cost of reagents comes to 90.48 million yuan per day. After adding labor costs, it costs up to 231.58 million yuan a day to do COVID tests across the country. The National Medical Insurance Administration said on May 26 that the cost should be borne by local governments. These figures are pretty high.We compared the estimated annual testing expenditure of each city with this year’s medical budget, and found that many second- and third-tier cities are facing significant financial pressure. For example, the testing budget in the northern city of Hohhot exceeds its medical budget. Without help, testing could be a heavy burden for these cities.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010523
A Shanghai District Declares Snap Lockdown for Mass COVID Testing,At least two districts will screen more than 4 million residents over the weekend as the city continues to report sporadic coronavirus cases.,2022-06-09,"SHANGHAI — A district in Shanghai announced a temporary lockdown to test all its residents for the coronavirus just over a week after the city lifted nearly all COVID-19 restrictions, while several apartment blocks in multiple areas have been sealed.  All 2.65 million residents of Minhang District will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test Saturday morning, according to an announcement Thursday. A lockdown throughout the district will be imposed during “the screening period.” Songjiang District will also require its 1.9 million residents to participate in a nucleic acid test on Saturday and Sunday, officials said. However, it’s unclear if the district would be locked down. Shanghai lifted its citywide lockdown on June 1 after being shut for two months, halting economic activities in the country’s financial hub. The city of 25 million has since reported 107 COVID-19 infections, and authorities have cautioned residents over the possible resurgence of the virus. “With the resumption of work and production accelerating and people moving frequently, the city is still at risk of the rebound of an outbreak,” Zhao Dandan, a city health official, said at a press conference Tuesday. In the past week, several residential compounds in different districts have been sealed after coronavirus cases were detected in those areas. The city now has 20 “medium-risk” areas scattered across eight districts, and residents there are required to stay at home for 14 days and get tested every day. On Wednesday, the city reported nine local infections, all detected inside quarantine areas. Officials said on May 31 that fewer than 200,000 people would remain in areas designated as “quarantine” zones after the lockdown. In downtown Xuhui District, several residential blocks have been placed under a 14-day or seven-day lockdown, local officials said. Some buildings had green fences installed, barring residents from leaving and resembled the early days of lockdown in April. Community volunteers in full hazmat suits were seen guarding the area Wednesday morning, as delivery drivers passed packages through the fences. Behind the green fences, people described confusion and pressure to leave home for quarantine centers. Residents Miranda Tsetskhladze and George Mocea told Sixth Tone that they had a “traumatic” experience, as hazmat-suited workers surrounded them on the street and stopped them from leaving in an effort to push them to get on a bus to a quarantine hotel. Their compound was locked down Saturday after a case was discovered at a compound whose rear wall abuts theirs. Although the block did not appear in the day’s list of medium-risk areas, dozens of workers in personal protective clothing banged on doors and ran a constant announcement through a loudspeaker urging residents to leave “for their own safety.” Few complied. When the two longtime Shanghai residents walked out to the barricade to receive groceries, they said they were surrounded by people in hazmat suits, who prevented them from returning home for about 30 minutes and suggested that refusing to leave could cause trouble with their visa status. Eventually, the two managed to get back inside their homes. Some residents in Xuhui told Sixth Tone that a few apartment blocks in proximity to areas deemed at-risk were barricaded. The broader shutdown was announced only on a subdistrict WeChat public account, three days after fences were installed. It’s not clear how many other places could be subject to similar quiet lockdowns. But as concerns over another large-scale lockdown grow, authorities denied rumors about a new round of citywide mass testing, domestic media reported Thursday. Shanghai has largely resumed all business operations, including public transport since the lockdown was lifted last week, though the city is far from bustling again. Residents are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result from the last 72 hours, or proof that the test has been taken in the past 24 hours, to access most public venues and transportation.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010521
Collage: Seeing Shanghai for the First Time in Months,Photographers record city’s first day without lockdown restrictions.,2022-06-02,"SHANGHAI — As June 1 began at midnight, most of Shanghai officially opened after a two-month lockdown. Many people couldn't wait to go out, to feel free, or to meet, hug, laugh, and chat with friends or family. Within hours, some parts of the city looked as they had before the ordeal began: midnight traffic jams city highway, and young people gathered on the Bund all night. Others steeled themselves to return to the office. Stores are gradually reopening, and crowds formed people rushed to get long overdue haircuts their hair, doctor visits, and drinks. Some malls were empty, while at others people queued up to buy luxury goods. On nearly every corner, people are lining up for COVID-19 tests, now required every 72 hours, from early in the morning til late at night.

Shanghai Finds New COVID-19 Cases Day After Lifting Lockdown,Residents are required a negative nucleic acid test from within 72 hours to access public transport and move freely in the city.,2022-06-02,"Shanghai has reported seven new COVID-19 cases a day after the city lifted a two-month lockdown to contain the virus surge, local authorities said during a press conference Thursday afternoon. Three infections were found in the downtown Jing’an District and four in the financial center of Pudong New Area, officials said. The city ended nearly all COVID-19 restrictions Wednesday, allowing shops to reopen and people to move freely without time restrictions. But authorities said about 890,000 people will remain locked down in “quarantine” and “control” areas still considered at risk of COVID transmission. Shanghai has mandated a 72-hour negative nucleic acid test result for all residents to access public transport and other venues such as supermarkets, malls, and parks. Long lines of people waiting to get their COVID test were a common sight in the city Wednesday evening and Thursday. Many residents complained of long wait times and insufficient testing booths. The city would add more COVID testing booths and “significantly extend” testing and sampling times, said Xia Kejia, head of the city’s COVID-19 screening team. He added that the city will also add more 24-hour testing sites.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010476
Residents Crowd COVID Testing Sites to Move Across Shanghai Freely,The city requires a negative nucleic acid test result to access most public spaces and transport.,2022-06-02,"SHANGHAI — Many Shanghai residents lined up outside coffee shops, bars, and restaurants when the city reopened after a two-month lockdown Wednesday. But some of the longest lines were seen outside COVID-19 testing booths. The lines snaked through the streets late into Wednesday night and on Thursday morning, as millions waited to get their throats swabbed. Though such tests were conducted within the residential compounds during the lockdown, residents now need to walk to their nearest testing stations, usually within a 15-minute walking distance. The tests are free until the end of June, and they determine people’s mobility and freedoms. A negative nucleic acid test result from within the last 72 hours is mandatory to board public transport or enter any venue such as parks and malls. The frequent mass testing is a major part of China’s “zero-COVID” strategy, which authorities say will allow the normal operation of economic activities. It’s now also a part of the central government’s “normalized” testing plan that requires cities to test residents every other day or a few times a week to detect COVID-19 cases early. In Shanghai, the 72-hour rule is driving crowds to testing centers, which is testing their capacity, too. Local authorities on Monday said the city had set up 15,000 test stations for its 25 million residents. On Thursday, officials said they would “significantly extend” testing and sampling times, as well as add more 24-hour testing sites. The city’s health code app shows one testing kiosk at almost every 200 meters in some densely populated downtown areas. While some said their test took a matter of minutes, many residents complained they had to wait for over an hour. As many testing booths are only open for about three hours each in the morning and afternoon — a few hospitals, however, offer a 24-hour service — some waiting in line said the staff on duty left after the shifts were over, according to Xinmin Evening News. Those waiting for over an hour said they were so annoyed that they even called the police. Zhang Zehong from Pudong New District told Sixth Tone she couldn’t test Wednesday as the kiosk in her neighborhood closed two hours earlier than shown on the app. So she went to a hospital with a 24-hour service Thursday morning, only to find no staff and a line stretching over 100 meters. “So many issues need to be fixed,” Zhang said. Online, on microblogging platform Weibo, many are sharing similar stories of long testing times. One photo showed people lining up with their umbrellas open to shelter from the sun. “It’s been very hot recently, several people passed out when standing (in line),” one Weibo user wrote. “I visited five sites but each had long queues. This is not really humane enough. Don’t these mobile kiosks cause more people to gather?” another Weibo user wrote. Others seemed confused by the testing rules in general. Some posts on Weibo described how they were turned away from hospitals Wednesday, as they still required a negative nucleic acid test result from the last 48 hours instead of the 72 hours. Meanwhile, some residents told Sixth Tone that some of their nearby sites were not willing to test those who had recovered from COVID-19 and back from quarantine sites, or fangcang. A testing booth near Changping Road and Xikang Road in Jing’an District even had a notice saying “personnel returning from fangcang cannot do nucleic acid tests at the sampling site for the time being,” according to Xinmin Evening News. However, the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission has said that those returning from quarantine centers can get tested in their neighborhood booths. They are required to show a discharge certificate and shouldn’t have any COVID-19 symptoms, so staff members can test accordingly. Authorities on Wednesday also said that they were open to suggestions from the public after the testing kiosks were overwhelmed on the first day. A retiree surnamed Zhang in Xuhui District told Sixth tone that he filed a complaint about the long wait time through the city service hotline on Wednesday. He also mentioned that a few new sites had popped up by Thursday morning. “It only took me 10 minutes to get the test,” Zhang said.  And for people with more money than patience, companies are already looking to capitalize on the demand for hassle-free COVID tests. A poster showing a health management company offering door-to-door sampling and promising results within two hours went viral Thursday. The “VVIP” service costs 3,000 yuan ($449) for each test. But the company said it has scrapped its plan after criticism.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010471

Shanghai Emerges From Lockdown to Familiar Sights and Sounds,China’s financial hub lifted almost all restrictions as COVID-19 cases waned.,2022-06-01,"SHANGHAI — The chatter of café crowds and bargaining at the market. The horns and rumble of traffic. Barking dogs. After two months of near silence, Shanghai sounded like a city again Wednesday as it dropped all lockdown restrictions for most of its 25 million residents. It was the first time since April that many Shanghai residents were able to leave their apartment compounds without time limits and pass systems, and the first day that the great majority of businesses were able to reopen in two months. Crowds gathered at cafés, grocery stores, and other shops. Most restaurants, meanwhile, remained shut or served only takeout and delivery. The lockdown officially ended at midnight Tuesday. In the hours before, excitement built. Small parties gathered in bar streets, outside parks, and riverside walkways. About a dozen people, some with dogs, entered Anfu Road with beers and a bottle of champagne after police removed the barricades from the popular hangout spot around 10 p.m. They celebrated quietly until police moved the party on at around 11 p.m. At midnight, brief cheers drifted out of the windows and faded away quickly. Overnight, cars poured onto the streets, the noise of the traffic keeping some residents awake all night. “From 2:00 a.m. on, there were the sounds of firecrackers and car horns, beep beep beep until 5:00 a.m.,” said Azlair Bi, an architect living near Yan’an Elevated Road. “It was roiling.”  While some couldn’t sleep, others woke up early to finally head home after being trapped in the city for months. Two tile setters who spent the lockdown living in an unfurnished apartment woke at 4 a.m. and went to the train station at 7 a.m. to wait for a 2 p.m. train for the nearby city of Yangzhou. They face at least another week of quarantine when they reach home, under uncertain circumstances. As the sun rose, residents began adjusting to new post-lockdown requirements. Entering indoor spaces or taking public transport now requires displaying a negative nucleic acid test result from within 72 hours, and scanning a “venue code” that records people’s visits. The new neighborhood testing kiosks, which replace traveling testing teams, had lines stretching around corners. Two women finishing tests on West Nanjing Road said they’d waited 15 to 20 minutes for the throat swab.  At a bustling wet market, elderly shoppers grumbled about the venue code system, some shouting at staff about the inconvenience. On Shanghai’s streets, buses and subways resumed normal service, with light loads. On buses headed downtown from the north end of Jing’an District, there were fewer than 10 passengers. For once, not one looked at a phone, instead staring out the windows. Outside, in the city’s streetside café, familiar sights reemerged. Over a dozen customers sat in a cafe on Jianguo Road on a muggy morning, chatting or working on laptops. The owner, Daodao, told Sixth Tone that she wasn’t supposed to serve people indoors, but she couldn’t bring herself to refuse. Her reopening had come as a surprise: Local authorities contacted her only Tuesday afternoon permitting her to reopen. She’s offering only one kind of coffee bean owing to short supplies. While clothing stores, delis, and cafés reopened, most restaurants remained closed. At lunchtime, a crowd filled the tables outside a Shanghai Shake Shack burger joint, eating tacos from a nearby location of Chili’s. Shake Shack will reopen for outdoor dining Thursday, staff told Sixth Tone through a half-open security curtain. Though the city seemingly oozed a sense of normalcy, not everyone was able to get out. About 889,000 of the city’s 25 million residents would still remain in forms of quarantine after Wednesday, local officials said earlier this week.  Liu Weiqi, a Ph.D. student at Xi’an Jiaotong University, has at least another week of lockdown to endure after a neighbor tested positive a few days ago. Local authorities told residents of his apartment complex that they’ll be restricted at least until June 8, with two weeks or more to be added if another case is detected in that time.  The air in the compound is tense, Liu told Sixth Tone. Some residents argued in neighborhood WeChat groups that people should be allowed to leave if they were not in the same building as the infected person, while others went to the compound gate to protest. On the day of the city’s official reopening, he said, authorities have tolerated groups gathering in shared outdoor areas in defiance of local rules. “It’s definitely a disappointment still being stuck in my apartment,” Liu told Sixth Tone. “But I don’t think I will feel exhilarated once we get out. That’s just the life and the rights we should have.” Most university students also remain under tight controls, though schools have allowed students to leave for their hometowns in recent days. At Shanghai University, school officials said rules that keep students in their dorms would remain in place until June 5, and suggested a return to normal on June 13. “It would be a lie to say we don’t envy others regaining their freedom,” said a Shanghai University graduate student surnamed Zheng. “But at least we have hope now. It’s already way better than we expected.”  Perhaps unhappiest of all was a dog owner surnamed Lu. She said her elderly poodle escaped from her home and suffered a bad injury. “I left the door open while watching television and I didn’t realize my dog had gotten out,” she told Sixth Tone. Some time later, Lu saw a picture of an injured dog just outside the compound gate in the building’s WeChat group, and recognized her dog. She rushed outside to find it had been bitten by a 12-year-old shiba inu. “The owners of the shiba inu told me he was usually docile,” Lu said. “Maybe he got aggressive after being locked down at home for over two months.” Lu has had to spend her first day of full freedom at the veterinary clinic. Her poodle is now immobile, lying in bed with his back wrapped in gauze. The veterinarian has suggested more treatments and surgeries, which will cost a fortune. “It is just so sad he survived the lockdown but was injured once he tasted freedom,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010463
Learning the True Meaning of Freedom a Gift for Children’s Day,5-year-old Chenchen’s hopes for reopening: Legos and ice cream.,2022-06-01,"Chenchen, a 5-year-old resident of Shanghai, had a memorable Children’s Day last year — his family went to the neighboring city of Qidong and he saw fireworks for the first time. But this year, as Children’s Day coincides with the lifting of lockdown in Shanghai on June 1, the 5-year-old’s hopes are simple: he wants a new Lego set and he wants to eat some ice cream. Children’s Day, observed June 1 in China, is a day or half-day off for students under 14. Parents usually take them to the park, for a short trip, or a special meal, and often give gifts. This year, it’s also the day that most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents are ending lockdowns, with public transport and many stores reopening. For most of his time during the lockdown in the past two months, Chenchen took online lessons, did homework, practiced painting, played with Lego, and helped his mother with housework. “My favorite moments during the lockdown are when I hug my mom in the morning, at noon, and in the evening,” said Chenchen. “When I don’t do my homework well, she gets angry at me.” Chenchen used to take roller skating lessons for a few hours every day before the outbreak hit Shanghai. Months of lockdown have left him more sedentary, his mother says. On April 1, Shanghai went into full COVID-19 lockdown amid the country’s worst outbreak since 2020. Entertainment venues were shut down and schools suspended in-person classes since March 12, keeping children from learning and playing with friends.  Shanghai-based adolescent psychologist Ji Longmei said that many children suffered psychologically from lockdowns. She launched a free online consultation service during the period. Compared with the same period in previous years, in the past two months, Ji witnessed a “significant increase” in children’s mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and irritability. “The children of this generation are quite pitiful,” Ji said. “The childhood period is only 10 years or so, and they’ve spent nearly three years in the epidemic.” Being quarantined at home for over two months has deprived children of social experiences, which will impact their physical and mental development, Ji said. “Despite not yet knowing the long-term effects, what I have observed is that children who are vulnerable, introverted, or feel inferior have suffered a lot psychologically, and some have even felt life is pointless,” Ji added. In severe pandemic situations, children in Shanghai had to stay with their parents inside their apartments and did not step outside their front door except to go downstairs for COVID-19 testing. As the outbreak eased in Shanghai, children in the “prevention zones” could play inside the compound, and some of them were able to venture out for a bit of shopping and biking. Globally, pandemic lockdowns have disrupted the daily lives of children and adolescents, leading to more time spent at home, online learning, and a lack of social interaction, according to a report by the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. They reported increased stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression, but also reported positive coping strategies, resilience, social connections through digital media, more time spent with family, and relief from academic stress.  Tao Jianli, a social worker and mother of two kids, said there’s no point in complaining. “All we can do as individuals is to remain calm and positive and live as fully as we can under the given circumstances,” she said. “The epidemic will pass, the quarantine will end, and life will go on.” When the city reopens on Wednesday, Chenchen and his mother will go out to see how it looks. He may get some toys if there is a store open, his mother says. “Let him get fresh air outside and learn about the true meaning of freedom,” she told Sixth Tone.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010456
Some Shanghai Residents Worry About ‘Post-Lockdown Social Anxiety’,An online buzzword has captured the mood of people wary of the uncertainties that lie ahead.,2022-05-31,"Shanghai’s decision to lift its COVID-19 restrictions from Wednesday has come as a relief to millions of residents who have been cooped up indoors for two months. But some are also experiencing what they call a post-lockdown syndrome compounded by social anxiety. Hours after local authorities announced the city’s reopening plan Monday evening, thousands of people have shared the possible uneasiness that may emerge while interacting with people face-to-face. And many online are using a catchphrase to express that feeling or a state of mind: jiefeng shi shekong, which loosely translates as “post-lockdown social anxiety” in English. “I’ve been used to this life during the past two months, and now suddenly things will change,” a Shanghai resident surnamed Shao told Sixth Tone. “For example, thinking that I have to squeeze into the subway during peak hours to go to work sounds so surreal to me. I have no idea what the outside world is like.” Shanghai’s 25 million residents have been confined to their apartments since the city shut down on April 1 to contain its worst ever COVID-19 outbreak. While some have had the luxury to occasionally step out of their residences and see familiar faces in recent days, most have been stuck with virtual communication with limited in-personal interaction. The lack of human interaction has changed some people, with the lockdown shifting their behavioral patterns. Even those who were once outgoing and called themselves extroverts are now struggling to cope with pre-lockdown life in a post-lockdown era. Xingxing, using a pseudonym to speak with Sixth Tone, said she has been quarantined since March, due to her apartment complex being sealed early as the virus swept the city. So when she read the government notice on reopening the city and resuming work, the director of livestreaming at a cosmetic company felt more anxious than excited. “I used to be a very outgoing person, but now I feel uneasy about talking to people in real life,” Xingxing said. “Also, I haven’t worked in the office for two months. I’m afraid I will not be able to cope with the high pressure of work once I’m back.” This behavior, experts say, is common. Hu Bojun, a psychologist at United Family Counseling Center, told Sixth Tone that many Shanghai residents have been accustomed to a certain routine for the past two months or more. Outside of working remotely, their daily routine included going downstairs for COVID tests, trying to purchase supplies through group buying, and getting updates on the city’s coronavirus outbreak. “Even though (lockdown life) is abnormal, there’s a sense of normality that they know what to expect,” according to Hu, who has been working with lockdown support groups in the past two months. “With the sudden end of lockdown, all that normality that they’ve just established suddenly seems to go out of the window.” Hu said the feeling that many people are experiencing could be attributed to the transitionary period that comes with a certain degree of post-lockdown uncertainty. For example, getting a COVID test, as the city now requires a 72 hour test result to access public services and enter offices, the fear of getting infected or identified as a close contact, and the pressure to perform even better at work, among others. This triggers anxiety for some even amid seemingly good news, Hu said. The lockdown has greatly affected people’s mental health over the months, with the city’s hotlines receiving a large number of calls from residents. Many called with lockdown-related issues that triggered anxiety and depression. But with the lockdown now ending, Hu said that it was equally important to recognize the post-lockdown trauma that affects people’s mental health in the long term. Those who have been directly impacted by the lockdown, such as people who’ve lost family members or jobs, could be more vulnerable and that self-care is crucial. “Post-lockdown is a period of transition and learning,” she said. “It’s a period of finding out what worked and what doesn’t work … to not rush into answering these questions, to actually use this time to think about what are my priorities in my life, because I think it’s a good time for reflection during the transition.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010455
Shanghai Promises End to Lockdown for 96% of Population,"City officials said most people will be able to move around “without restriction” from Wednesday. About 890,000 people will remain in lockdown, in areas which are still considered at risk of COVID-19 transmission.",2022-05-30,"Up to 96% of Shanghai’s residents could be out of lockdown on Wednesday, the city government said in an announcement Monday evening. Shanghai announced that most people would be allowed to enter and leave apartment compounds from Wednesday “without any restrictions.” About 890,000 people will remain in lockdown, in areas which are still considered at risk of COVID-19 transmission. These include the “quarantine” and “control” zones. These designations are usually based on positive test results in the past 14 days. The city has only seven remaining “medium-risk areas,” a higher level of alert. On Wednesday, public bus and rail transport will “basically resume operations,” city officials said. Taxis and ride-hailing cars will also resume normal operations, and private cars will be allowed to get back on the road. Four subway lines and some bus routes have resumed service since last week, mostly shuttling people to the city’s airports and train stations. Officials said earlier that shopping malls and department stores would resume operations from Wednesday, with total visitors not to exceed 75% of maximum capacity. At least some workers are set to go back to the office Wednesday. (This reporter among them). Re-opening will involve a lot of COVID tests. Shanghai residents will need negative PCR test results within 72 hours to access public transport and crowded places. The city relaxed this requirement from 48 hours in an announcement Sunday. The city has set up about 15,000 testing stations. City officials said testing capacity will be able to meet demand as the city resumes work and production.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010448
Beijing Axes COVID-19 Testing Lab Over Procedural Violations,The city has taken action against three labs in the past 10 days.,2022-05-30,"Beijing’s health authority has suspended operations of a third COVID-19 testing lab in over a week for violating standard operating procedures to save cost and speed up their work as the city ramped up screenings amid a fresh outbreak. Beijing’s Zhongtong Lanbo Medical Testing Laboratory was found to be incompletely logging test results and mixing multiple samples together while testing, Beijing Municipal Health Commission said Sunday. Officials deemed the practice “illegal.” “Nucleic acid tests are the key technical means to detect new COVID-19 infections,” Wang Xiao’e, an official from the commission, said during Sunday’s press conference. “The illegal practices seriously violate the quality and safety regulations and affect the accuracy of the test results. It could lead to the untimely discovery of COVID-positive residents and lead to the further spread of the epidemic.” Registered in 2007, Zhongtong Lanbo is a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-listed company China Isotope & Radiation Corporation. It was approved to conduct nucleic acid tests in July 2020. Since the new wave of infections was detected earlier this month, the city has ordered regular mass testing for its more than 21 million residents. Beijing logged 12 COVID-19 cases Sunday, the third-highest number nationwide after Shanghai and Hebei province. Zhongtong Lanbo is the third nucleic acid testing lab in Beijing that has been found to flout standard testing guidelines in the last 10 days. Authorities said they have started the procedure to revoke its license. Meanwhile, Beijing Pushi has had its lab license revoked over similar violations. Police have detained 17 members of staff from Beijing Jinzhun and eight from Beijing Zhongtong Lanbo labs — including both their corporate representatives — over their possible involvement in the illegal operations. “They knew clearly what they did could result in the inaccuracy of the results,” Pan Xuhong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, said referring to the latest findings. Controversies involving testing labs and the accuracy of nucleic acid test results were also reported in Shanghai in early May. After residents complained of false positive results, city authorities said they inspected over 100 labs performing nucleic acid tests and found no malpractice. One resident told Sixth Tone she was taken to a quarantine center 10 days after testing positive for the virus during nucleic acid screening, but the self-test antigen kit detected no infection between those days. However, the woman said she started showing COVID-19 symptoms after returning home from the quarantine center. The self-test kit showed she had the coronavirus. “It’s clear I was not infected before I was sent to the hospital,” she said. After a public outcry, Shanghai’s health commission said on May 10 that it was investigating Zhongke Runda Medical Testing Laboratory and would not tolerate any illegal practices. Authorities haven’t released results of the investigation yet, and the lab in question is still offering nucleic acid tests. A person who works at a nucleic testing lab in Shanghai told Sixth Tone that some facilities don’t turn down samples, even if they’re outside their capacity. “Some companies view the outbreak as an opportunity to make money — but it’s not,” said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity. “You can challenge your limits, but you cannot blindly accept assignments or make pledges to the government that you cannot possibly achieve. Your real capacity is the base of what you want to do.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010446
Shenzhen Funeral Home Requires COVID Test Result for Dead,The funeral parlor said the requirement is mandatory only when there are local outbreaks.,2022-05-26,"Some Chinese cities have COVID-19 rules not just for the living but also the dead. The government-backed Shenzhen Funeral Home said it requires a nucleic acid test result for people who have died in areas under virus-protection measures before it proceeds with the last rites, according to a screenshot from the city’s online service platform. A COVID-19 test result helps the funeral parlor to follow necessary protocols in case a person who died of other causes was found to be infected. The requirement has been in place since early this year, domestic media reported Wednesday. Test results of family members are accepted when such results for the deceased cannot be produced. A member of staff at the funeral home’s hotline told Sixth Tone that such a requirement is mandatory only when there are local outbreaks. Currently, only family members involved in on-site funeral procedures should produce a negative COVID-19 test result taken within the past 48 hours. An operator at Shenzhen’s city service hotline said they were unable to locate official documents and policies requiring a nucleic acid test of the deceased. Shenzhen has reported sporadic local COVID-19 flare-ups this year, with the city locked down for a week in mid-March. As part of the central government’s “normalized” testing plan, Shenzhen has made negative results from the past 72 hours mandatory to access public transport and crowded spaces since early April. Such requirements sometimes resulted in tragedies for those in urgent need of medical treatment during the lockdown in other cities. Online, while some users said the funeral parlor’s requirement was reasonable in curbing potential transmission chains, others found it ethically and emotionally unacceptable. Many criticized it for showing little respect to the dead. “I’m not sure if I would have to wear a mask for the rest of my life … and show my health code when I’m about to be cremated,” one user wrote on microblogging platform Weibo.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010417
What It Means When Epidemic Prevention Becomes a ‘War’,"Treating illness like a battle can help mobilize popular support, but what about the long-term risks?",2022-05-25,"In her book “Illness as Metaphor,” Susan Sontag explores the various ways society has sought to understand diseases through metaphoric expressions, and how those metaphors are translated into a politics that governs the lives of the ill. One of the most common metaphors she analyzes has been all but inescapable during the current pandemic: illness prevention and treatment as a kind of “warfare.” This language isn’t limited to COVID-19. As Sontag found after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the spread of cancerous cells through the body is often likened to a process of “invasion” and “colonization”; the purpose of treatment is to “kill” the invasive pathogens or tumors. “When a patient’s body is considered to be under attack, the only treatment is counterattack,” she writes. The widespread use of these metaphors can be traced to the popularization of germ theory in the late 19th century. At the time, scientists understood their work as identifying “evil” pathogens that invade the body and cause illness. Their job was to “defend” the body, “counterattack,” and “destroy” the intruder. Warfare as a metaphor for illness long predates the 19th century, however. In traditional Chinese medicine, illness is frequently likened to a kind of assault. “The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor,” compiled more than 2,000 years ago, states that diseases are caused by a series of invasions by “external evil.” Over the centuries, military metaphors became entrenched in TCM theory and practice, often expressed through binary opposites like “internal righteousness” and external evil. In the first half of the 20th century, the gradual influx of Western medical knowledge introduced new military metaphors for disease to China, where they gradually combined with their TCM counterparts to create an attitude of militant hostility toward illness. Medical workers became frontline “soldiers,” the immune system was seen a kind of fortification, and drugs were humanity’s weapons in the fight against disease.  After the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, military metaphors were almost de rigueur in Chinese mainstream media coverage of illness, especially during times of political turmoil or epidemics. In an analysis of articles on disease published in the People’s Daily between 1946 and 2019, I found the use of military metaphors peaked during both the Cultural Revolution and the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. I also found that the use of aggressive language, such as calls to “eliminate” or “battle” a disease, were more common than expressions like “build lines of defense” or “resist the epidemic.” Military metaphors of all kinds were accompanied by collective subjects — “we,” “everyone,” and “all the people” — that emphasized the masses over the individual.  This tendency has carried over into the current pandemic. Facing an outbreak of unprecedented scale, China has relied on militarized language to mobilize public opinion and secure people’s cooperation in epidemic prevention work. In COVID-19 articles published on the official Weibo social media account of the People’s Daily, military metaphors were second in importance only to terms directly describing COVID-19 itself. The purpose of these metaphors is clear: uniting the Chinese people and improving national morale in the “battle” against the coronavirus. But the overuse of military metaphors can also bring about social problems. As Sontag notes in a later essay, “AIDS and Its Metaphors”, “Military metaphors contribute to the stigmatizing of certain illnesses and, by extension, of those who are ill.” The excessive use of military metaphors can lead people to see patients, as well as diseases and pathogens, as enemies who need to be isolated and “eliminated.” It can also lead to unnecessary levels of stress in society, as people grapple with the pressure of a protracted “war” against an illness or pathogen. This may negatively impact pandemic prevention work in the long term.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010415
Train to Chengdu: Two Students Reflect on Leaving Shanghai,Many are setting off for their hometowns with mixed feelings.,2022-05-25,"Many university students are now allowed to leave Shanghai for their hometowns — but the journey isn’t easy. It’s a tedious process that starts with applying for permits to leave their dormitories, securing a train seat, and having a negative nucleic acid test result 48 hours before boarding. And that’s just half the hassle. Some students from several provinces have complained of poor sanitation in quarantine facilities, costly fees for the 14-day stay, and an unwelcoming attitude in their hometowns. Some cities have waived such fees, with Chengdu in the southwestern Sichuan province exempting them Monday. Sixth Tone spoke with two students — both using pseudonyms for privacy — who shared their arduous journey to Chengdu. The interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity. Luo Rui, 18 Freshman at Shanghai Ocean University We were locked inside the campus from late February and confined to our dorms from mid-March. For over 50 days, we would do two antigen self-tests and a nucleic acid test every day. As a volunteer, I would get up at 6:15 a.m. every day to distribute antigen test kits to students. I was desperate to return home. We didn’t eat very well. On Sunday, we set off from campus on school buses early in the morning. About over 1,000 students left that morning. We were excited and took photos nonstop after being confined for over 70 days. I arrived at Hongqiao Railway Station about two hours before the train’s departure at 10:36 a.m.  When the train started moving, several people around me cried. I nearly cried when my mother kept calling me to check on the train status. The carriage was almost full, and the majority of passengers were university students. Many either chatted with others, watched dramas on their phone, or slept. But it was quieter than normal train rides that would otherwise have children and businessmen making phone calls. I wore an N95 mask and a blue surgical mask beneath throughout the trip. About 70% of the students around me also wore hazmat suits with glass face shields. I also kept a 1-meter distance while lining up for the toilet on the train. During the entire journey, I kept disinfecting my hands with alcohol wipes as soon as I came across another passenger, touched a surface, or used the toilet. I used two packets with about 30 wipes each. For lunch and dinner, I ate a boxed meal and rice noodles that were sold on the train. It tasted better than meals at school. I finished eating within 10 minutes without using my phone, and quickly put on my masks. I was also carrying some snacks distributed by our school. I hoped the train could go faster and send me home soon. I made a date with my high school friends to go out soon after the 14-day quarantine. We arrived at Chengdu East Railway Station late at night and waited until about 2 a.m. to check into the quarantine hotel. The hotel asked us to pay 6,000 yuan ($900) for a 14-day quarantine, which was unreasonable, as centralized quarantine is required to last for only seven days. We refused to pay without having an official document from the government.  I had mixed feelings while negotiating with the hotel employees for more than 30 minutes: anxiety, uneasiness, aggrievement, and desperation. We thought we would ultimately settle down after arriving home, but weren’t expecting a debate over quarantine fees. I went to bed at about 3:30 a.m. after taking a shower and woke up at 6:15 a.m. despite feeling tired. Perhaps because my body was used to it. Now the 295 yuan accommodation fee has been exempted. We just need to pay 100 yuan per day for meals for seven days. During the past three months of lockdown, I could not focus on studying in the dorm, eating what I wanted, or living a carefree life. The lesson is that I could manage better if I were in lockdown again. Wen Sen, 19Freshman at Shanghai Jian Qiao University As soon as we were notified of the policy for returning home in mid-May, I immediately applied to book a ticket. The situation here changes quickly. I was locked inside the campus as soon as I returned from the winter holidays on February 17. I have lost 20 kilograms since being confined to our dorms since early April, as meals were allocated and we had fewer choices. Going home was a torturous journey, though I feel more secure now. After the flights I booked were canceled three times, I bought a high-speed railway ticket to Chengdu. We set off at 2 a.m. on Sunday from campus on buses provided by the school. It cost us 50 yuan each. I stayed up the whole night so I wouldn’t miss any announcements.  It was about 4 a.m. by the time we got to Hongqiao Railway Station. We then joined a line to enter the station — it took us an hour and a half to get inside.  The station was particularly crowded and there were no empty seats. I think that about 80% of passengers were students that day. After five hours of waiting, and 12 and a half hours on the train, we arrived at Chengdu East Railway Station. We waited another four hours there before we were transferred to the quarantine hotel, by which point it was 3 a.m.  I went to bed at about 4:30 a.m. on Monday and had to wake up at 8 a.m. I had classes all day that day. I was very sleepy and couldn’t focus. My body ached and felt like I had gone rock climbing. It’s a pity that I have been in lockdown the entire semester. I hoped to walk around Shanghai and visit nearby areas. But I just turned to my phone, edited videos, raised flowers, and painted on campus instead. When preparing for the college entrance exams at high school, we were always told about how life on campus is unique. But we’re living a college life as if we are still in high school, or even worse. There's little freedom and our experiences are so limited.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010413
"With Bittersweet Memories, Students Leave Shanghai in Droves","While some are being welcomed in their hometowns with free quarantine, others are not having it so easy.",2022-05-24,"SHANGHAI — Dressed in a blue hazmat suit and a white N95 mask, Huang Yi stepped out of her university compound for the first time in 76 days. It was 5:56 a.m. on Saturday, and she was finally able to leave Shanghai for her hometown in the northwestern Shaanxi province.  “Everything was so surreal,” said the sophomore at Shanghai Normal University, describing the deserted streets on the route from her school to Hongqiao Railway Station. Huang is among the students leaving the metropolis in recent days, though no official numbers have been released. Universities in Shanghai are now encouraging and organizing students to return home, as the city gradually lifts the lockdown which has dragged on for over 50 days. Most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents have been confined to their residential compounds since April 1. But some apartment complexes and most universities had been locked down from as early as mid-March after some schools detected infections. Students have since described a multitude of lockdown-related issues, with their health codes often determining their movements within the campus. Some complained of a lack of privacy while others said they faced problems ordering food. “It was draining to live a life of just taking online classes, eating, and sleeping,” Huang said, adding that she was not even allowed to get a shower during this difficult time. Several universities have now issued guidelines, allowing students to leave the campus as long as their residential buildings have been free of COVID-19 cases for the past 14 days. One screenshot claiming to be an official notice listed 52 major cities as key destinations and railway networks increasing capacity to ensure the homecoming process and has been widely circulating among university students. In response, several cities have announced free centralized quarantine for returning students. On Monday, Chengdu in the southwestern Sichuan province became the latest city to exempt accommodation fees during quarantine for students coming from areas with COVID-19 surges. Wang Ying, a postgraduate journalism and communication major at Shanghai University, said she booked a train ticket and applied for an exit permit from the university as soon as the school notified students of the policy on May 19. She is leaving for the eastern Shandong province on Thursday and has been busy packing and preparing for the journey, as well as comparing notes with peers on the same trip and calling government offices and the neighborhood committee back home to ensure there would be no hiccups. “When you see someone bartering instant noodle seasonings in the WeChat group, you know you’re not living a normal life,” Wang told Sixth Tone, adding the nearly three-month long restrictions have been exhausting. “I am aware that my current life needs to change, despite growing used to it.” But not everyone has been able to plan their trips home so smoothly. Some students said they have changed their plans to leave Shanghai over steep quarantine fees in their hometowns, which they need to pay on their own. Several students from the neighboring Jiangsu province asked for more understanding from local governments in an open letter that went viral Monday. The post said some cities, without naming any, were asking students to wait another 20 days before making their trips home, while some 14-day centralized quarantine sites cost 800 yuan ($120) per night. Some students also told Sixth Tone that they have been delaying their travels due to inconsistent and vague local policies for returnees. They fear that the situation in Shanghai may change at a moment’s notice and fear being stuck inside their dormitories again. He Qiqi, a postgraduate student at Fudan University who left for Guangzhou on Monday, said she had signed up for a government-run seven-day quarantine in her home city of Huizhou. But the bus that was supposed to pick her up never arrived at the train station, and she was requested by local authorities to stay in a quarantine hotel in Guangzhou until she would be picked up. “Everything was a mess on the railway platform,” He said, adding that the authorities from home told her they were unaware of her arrival when she called. But while some students are leaving in droves and others are planning their departures after enduring months of restrictions, a few of them are also determined to stay in Shanghai. Some of them still need to finish coursework and others are either waiting for job interviews or starting employment after graduating in June. Shen Lingyi, a final year postgraduate at Shanghai University, found a job after fielding 150 applications, so she decided to stay put. “I feel fine staying here because it probably isn’t that bad living off campus,” she said.“But I’m afraid my college life is really likely to end in silence without any celebrations.” Wang, who is leaving for Shandong, said she was ready to leave Shanghai physically, though she isn’t yet mentally prepared to bid farewell to the city she called home for a few years. “I wish I could have a meal with my mentor before leaving because she’s helped me a lot in my two-year graduate life,” she said. “But I told her that no matter what, I will definitely come back and visit her in the future.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010399
"Shanghai Reopening Diary: Dogs, and Barbers, Outside on Last Day of Lockdown",Rolling coverage of a city trudging toward normalcy.,2022-05-24,"After almost two months of total lockdown, Shanghai is gradually reopening. On this page, Sixth Tone will bring you regular updates on the city as we're seeing it. May 31, 2022 Giving Street Haircuts on Lockdown’s Last Day Shanghai announced Monday evening that all residential compounds in low risk areas will be open from June 1, and the neighborhood committees will not be allowed to block residents from entering and leaving the community. This means that the reopening of Shanghai is really happening. However, with most Shanghai residents’ hair growing like weeds for more than two months, many worry their hairstyle is not ready to meet friends and colleagues. Days before the official return to work, hundreds of hairdressers have been seen working on the street, especially in downtown Jing’an District. Katie Zhang is one of them. In normal times, she charges 480 yuan ($72) for a haircut at a Jing’an salon. But during lockdown, she’s been trimming hair alfresco to help neighbors, charging as little as 50 yuan. In a phone call with Sixth Tone on Monday evening, Zhang described running a hair salon on streets without a proper mirror and a shampoo station over the last month. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.  I started working in late April, when we couldn’t leave our compounds. One of my clients is a police officer. He negotiated with my neighborhood committee, and entered my community with a work pass. I was allowed to cut his hair in the outdoor public space within the gate. I took the chance to serve some neighbors. Later, my police friend also took me to another community where a friend of his lives. I was also approved by the neighborhood committee there to do some business temporarily. I started to go out to the street to do haircuts in May, after getting myself a work pass with the help of my police friend. Usually, I make appointments with customers who manage to go out. Some passersby will come and ask for a haircut, but my schedule has actually been filled by various customers and friends of customers on WeChat the day before.  I have been a haircutting machine in recent days, standing eight hours a day, cutting more than 30 people’s hair a day. This is a new record for my 24-year career. Before, my busiest time of the year was the Longtaitou Festival in February, when I sometimes serve up to 20 clients. Chinese believe having a haircut on that day will bring luck. Today, I set up a station outside the gate of an old client’s residential compound. He prepared coffee and cigarettes for me, and then called out more than 30 acquaintances from his community for me to serve. I feel bad for the condition of some people’s hair. Some women who had permed big curls before have not taken care of their hair seriously in the past two months, and it has ended up very coarse and brittle. For those who had dyed their hair, new hair grows out, and it does not match the dyed color at all. I can’t save their hair completely, since I can’t do a perm on the street. I’m doing my best to style their hair with clippers. I ask my clients to wash and blow dry their hair at home before coming to me for a cut. I am used to cutting hair when it is dry. I think it’s better to adjust the styling after the hair has returned to its natural state. I know most hairdressers prefer to cut hair when it is still wet, but that way the styling from the shop is lost as soon as the client goes home and washes their hair. It’s fine that I don’t have a shampoo station, but the hard part now is that there is no mirror. I need to walk around more often than usual, and check all the angles. Some clients get even more nervous than I do and keep asking me to take pictures of their heads during the haircut. I met a lot of new clients within the past month. In general, everyone is very grateful for my work. I think people have become more united after this lockdown. Of course, there are still some nosy passersby who come over to inquire about my price. When they hear that it’s higher than the one next door, they shout that it is so expensive. I have stopped talking to that kind of person. My price in the shop is much higher. I have already made a big discount for the special situation. I come out to work not only for the money, but to find something meaningful to do. Tuesday might be my last day working on the streets. I miss my studio so much! — Wu Peiyue; editor: David Cohen.  Even On a Leash, They’re Happy to Be Outside SHANGHAI — It’s Monday afternoon at a riverside park in Xuhui District. Some people are taking a walk along the walkway. Some are chatting on a bench and looking at ships on the river, playing saxophone, or doing tai chi. Some younger visitors are skateboarding and picnicking with friends. And other visitors are chasing each other and wrestling, sniffing each other’s butts, or barking at everyone who passes by. Binjiang Park, on the west bank of the Huangpu River, is a favorite with Shanghai’s canine population. After two months of very limited walks, they’re settling back into their old routines. Chen Kang lives just 15 minutes’ walk from the park. Every day after dinner, he walks his dog in the park for about an hour, which was their routine for the two years, until 25 million Shanghai residents were locked down April 1, amid the country’s worst COVID-19 outbreak since 2020. “When hearing the news, my first concern was how my dog was going to do his business,” Chen told Sixth Tone Monday. During the lockdown, residents of his apartment complex were not allowed to walk their dogs even in the courtyard. Many rushed to pick up grass and rocks to make an “immersive experience” for their dogs. Chen did the same, but his 2-year-old adopted dog wasn’t buying it. After two days watching his black-and-white country dog hold it in, he decided to let him out alone to pee and poo in the compound. “I felt bad about not cleaning up his poop but I was also relieved that he didn’t have to suffer,” 20-something Chen said. But a few days later, he was reported by a neighbor to the neighborhood committee who then sent a message in the building WeChat group ordering him to keep the dog inside. “Back then, there were quite a few infected cases in the compound and everyone was anxious,” Chen recalled. “I don’t want to bring more trouble to others, so I had no choice but to keep him home.” To his relief, after three more days, his dog learned how to pee and poo at home. “I realized dogs are better at adapting themselves than I thought. It’s the human who doesn’t have the resolution to make the change.” On Monday, the first day he was allowed to step out of his estate gate, Chen took his dog to their favorite park for walking and socializing. “Everything seems normal here,” Chen said, referring to the volume of people and dogs at the park. “When the coffee shops reopen, it’d be just perfect.” Liu, a 58-year-old Xuhui resident, has been dreaming about coming back to the park with her poodle Baobao since the middle of March. Her compound was sealed off nearly two weeks before the citywide lockdown. In mid-April, it was declared a “prevention zone,” after which residents were allowed to walk the dogs within the compound. “But the walk is definitely different,” Liu said. “I only walked her five minutes and feared she might catch the virus.” Monday morning Liu finally received a pass, allowing a single member of her household to go out for three hours yesterday and today. “I grabbed my bag, left my husband at home, and walked my dog out right away,” she giggled. “I had to take the opportunity when it’s there, because who knows what will happen tomorrow.” Baobao was making new friends at the park. One of them was a five-year-old crossbreed, visiting the park with owner Wang Jiaying. They had spent three hours at the park by the time Sixth Tone met them. “I think I’m probably happier than she is,” Wang said. “I feel life has almost got back to normal.” In her normal life, Wang usually brings her dog to the riverside park at weekends. Sometimes she goes there alone, sipping an ice latte, sitting in the breeze. When the weather is nice, she goes daytime camping with her friends and their dogs on the grass. “It’s a way of life,” 31-year-old Wang said. “It’s cool, lively, and relaxing here.” Life has been difficult for Wang in the past two months during the lockdown. Every single day, she’s anxious about what would happen to her dog if she’s infected with COVID-19. During the lockdown, some pets of people taken to quarantine centers were left at home alone, or even killed by quarantine workers. She came up with two options. She would either send the dog to a neighbor or leave it at home with enough food and water for two weeks.  But when she read online that all residents in the building where an infected individual lived would all be transferred to centralized quarantine, and people would enter her apartment to disinfect it, she worried her plans might fail. “Even though the government later clarified the rules, I still feel worried and uneasy,” Wang said. On Monday afternoon, the Shanghai government announced that the citywide lockdown would come to an end on June 1. “I hope it’s really the end of it,” said Wang. “Both my dog and I need freedom.” — Fan Yiying; editor: David Cohen.   May 30, 2022 Why Don’t We Always Let the Weeds Grow? I live in the New Jiangwan neighborhood of Yangpu District. Today, after almost two months of lockdowns and quarantines, I finally had the opportunity to step out of my residential community gate. Other neighborhoods in the city are allowing residents to make shopping trips, but where I live, the only stores open are a handful of pharmacies. Still, no one wanted to miss their chance to step back out into the wide world. Since the end of April, we were able to go downstairs for two hours every day. Yangpu has been the most locked-down district in the city since mid-May, so we felt lucky that we were even allowed to spend time in the courtyard most days. Our compound was divided into four groups, given two hours each for exercise. Even so, we’ve seen winter turn to spring, and spring to summer. The birds grow louder and louder, and wild grass and flowers spring up. In the last few weeks, I’ve seen children trying to catch butterflies in the tall grass. New Jiangwan was the first neighborhood in Yangpu to be allowed on the street. Thursday, shortly after 10 p.m., the neighborhood committee sent a message to the chat group with the new rules: Residents could leave the compound once every two days, for a maximum of two hours at a time. I set a goal for myself: No matter what, I was going out the next day. The past two months have taught me never to wait on these things; opportunities like this often only come once. At 7 a.m., I woke up and welcomed my new beginning with an at-home COVID-19 test followed by a nucleic acid test. I got my entry-exit pass with my nucleic acid test. At that moment, my emotions were all over the place. I went home to get ready, even though the passes wouldn’t take effect until 3 p.m. First, I had to pick an outfit. I’d spent the past two months wearing pajamas, only tossing on a jacket and some pants when I went downstairs. I skipped right over my spring wardrobe. I was finally going to wear the summer clothes I’d pulled out over the past two weeks. Then I packed my bag. During the lockdown, I’d pretty much only gone outside for COVID tests. It was enough to stuff my keys and phone into my pocket before heading downstairs. While I only had a walk ahead of me, I crammed my bag with a water bottle, an umbrella, a backup face mask, some disinfectant wipes, a shopping tote — what if I found a shop open? — and some snacks. I’d barely exercised while at home, and on the off-chance I got tired and couldn’t go on, I’d have a way to replenish my energy. My final preparation was psychological: I had to shift my mindset from listless to engaged. I slid my pass into a plastic sleeve and carefully placed it in my bag. Just looking at it lifted my spirits. The moment I stepped outside the community gate, it was as though I could see the sun for the first time in months. As I filmed the moment with my phone, I sighed: “At last, I’m out.” The security guard at the gate jokingly asked why I would say that on a livestream, but I wasn’t livestreaming; I didn’t even plan to post the video to social media. I just wanted a record of this important moment in my life.  The world outside was at once strange and familiar. All the shops were fenced off. I checked the dates on the fences and saw they were put up in May. The stores had been closed a long time by that point, so I’m not sure what the point of the fences was. I left my community with a new friend from lockdown. Like me, she lives alone. We planned to walk to the nearest metro station, two and a half kilometers away. There’s a shopping center there, though we knew it would still be closed. The road there had always been a pleasant green corridor. But after two months without cars or people, the medians had become veritable forests. The plants were showing off new blossoms with the exuberance of a ballroom of debutantes, each one more colorful than the next. As we walked, we came across weeds and wildflowers sprouting from every crack in the city’s surface — even the benches were shot through with sprouts. Lawns were a tangle of wild grass, dotted with flowers. When the wind rushed through them, they sounded like fields of grain. From a distance, the sight reminded me of the grasslands in my hometown in Xinjiang. I guess they were weeds, but I couldn’t stop looking at them. I hadn’t realized how much I’d missed living things. If people just leave them alone, plants and animals thrive. That’s not to say we should lock everyone up for the sake of other species, but maybe we should change the ways we interact with nature. The hedges along the road had grown to almost my height. More remarkably, they were flowering for the first time I could remember. Normally, they’re kept tightly cropped and trimmed. They’d never had an opportunity to bloom, and were seemingly intent on seizing their chance. The cherry trees, too, were sporting fruit. How had I never seen that before? In a small park along the riverside, the seeds of wildflowers had mixed with their cultivated cousins to make beautiful matches. Some passersby plucked flowers for themselves; others harvested mugwort to hang during the coming Dragon Boat Festival. When we stopped to chat with an older woman, she shared some of her harvest with us — an unexpected windfall. Elsewhere along the riverbank, we passed a small community vegetable garden. In it, an older gentleman was digging for potatoes. He told us that the rest of his vegetables had been stolen; the potatoes were all that was left. The garden had once been neatly manicured by area retirees. Now, it was overgrown with weeds, with hardly a vegetable in sight. We walked, snapping photos all the while, for an hour before we reached the metro. The number of other people on the street began to rise, and traffic police were everywhere. The shopping mall was completely fenced off. Outside the barriers, people stood and snapped photos, probably thinking to themselves of the food and shops within, or perhaps of their life over the previous two months. Like us, this was probably their first time outside their apartment compound in two months. There wasn’t anything to do but walk around, but their excitement was palpable. As they took in the wild growth around them, taking photos all the while, they, like us, marveled at nature’s magic. My neighbor and I agreed that these scenes of unchecked growth were beautiful. Why should plants be pruned and trimmed to suit human plans? Why should anything be? — Feng Jing; translator: Kilian O’Donnell; editor: David Cohen.   Shanghai Promises End to Lockdown for 96% of Population Up to 96% of Shanghai’s residents could be out of lockdown on Wednesday, the city government said in an announcement Monday evening. Shanghai announced that most people would be allowed to enter and leave apartment compounds from Wednesday “without any restrictions.” About 890,000 people will remain in lockdown, in areas which are still considered at risk of COVID-19 transmission... Read more    May 27, 2022 Thanks for Saving the City. Now Move That Tent! SHANGHAI — For weeks, thousands of delivery workers have been living on the streets to bring food and other essentials to Shanghai’s locked-down millions. Many had to sign pledges not to re-enter their apartment buildings and wound up living in tents. Now that the city’s opening up, they’re being told to get packing, five delivery drivers told Sixth Tone. Wei Xiao, a Meituan driver in Jing’an district, told Sixth Tone that he’s been hiding since he saw police and police cars gathered at the intersection of North Baoxing Road and Yanchang Road on Thursday at 8 p.m., dispersing rough sleepers and asking them to put away their tents. Wei Xiao is a pseudonym to protect the source’s privacy. Two Ele.me drivers resting under a viaduct told Sixth Tone that over the past weeks, the government has sealed off many sleeping spaces under the viaduct with baffles to prevent the drivers from staying overnight. “If you get dispersed here, you move to another place, and then get dispersed and move again. Sometimes you can’t sleep all night, and you have to work the next day. This has been the case since the beginning of the lockdown,” one of the two, surnamed Zhang, said. A Shanghai-based documentarian told Sixth Tone he’s heard many similar stories talking to drivers in Jing’an district last night. He has been following a group of delivery drivers in the past several weeks and documented their hunt for a place to stay in a Twitter thread on Thursday night. “There were tents being told to move every now and then but yesterday was much more intense. Suddenly they have nowhere to go,” he said. Food delivery platforms Meituan and Ele.me announced in their apps for drivers Thursday afternoon that camping will no longer be allowed after June 1. “All delivery riders must find accommodation or return to the community, and are not allowed to sleep on the streets, bridges, and public places, and are not allowed to set up tents or sleeping bags in non-government or platform placement sites,” the announcement wrote. “Riders who sleep on the streets will be urged to return, their e-passes will be canceled, and legal responsibilities will be pursued if they do not cooperate with law enforcement.” It’s easier said than done. “For now, my residential compound won’t let me in, and I don’t know where the free hotels are,” Wei said. To avoid being noticed by the police, Wei set up his tent behind a stand of bamboo Thursday night. “The bamboo is very dense. My tent has a camouflage pattern. People can hardly see me,” Wei told Sixth Tone. “Believe it or not, I set up the tent right next to a police station.” Wei said some of his driver peers encountered the dispersal yesterday, and had to keep moving around until they were able to settle down after midnight. “Police don’t care any more after 12:00 am,” Wei said. “Now, I can hardly see tents on the streets during the day.” Wei got a pass permit by registering as a full-time driver for Meituan, and started to work and live on the streets from May 10. Before the lockdown, Wei was a part-time Meituan driver and worked multiple hourly jobs to make ends meet in Shanghai. Wei is upset about the wretched situation faced by thousands of delivery drivers like him. “If the deadline set by the platform is June 1, why do they start dispersing us now?” Wei asked. — Wu Peiyue, Ye Zhanhang, Lü Xiao; editor: David Cohen.  Invitation to a Supermarket It was a precious day out Wednesday for people living in Xinjing area, Changning District. The neighborhood announced a new round of PCR tests on Monday, and then residents with exit passes could go out Wednesday and Friday. The streets even got a little crowded. Many people headed to the supermarket. You need four things to get in: a green digital health code, a negative PCR result from within the last 48 hours, an exit pass issued by the same subdistrict, and an invitation card from the store. The supermarket was the only shop open in the whole mall. With most of the lights off, the lobby looked spooky. The subway station right next door was closed too, with one of the entrances blocked with barriers and share bikes. In front of Hema, part of a grocery store chain run by Alibaba, there were 15 to 20 people lined up, waiting for about 15 minutes to get in. Some found themselves unable to enter, as they had failed to obtain an invitation card. These cards, which are issued by local residential committees, are in short supply. Inside the supermarket, most of the shelves were empty. There wasn’t much to choose from, but customers enjoyed the feeling of shopping and grabbed as much as they could. The snacks and drinks section was the only area where the shelves were full. Every customer was only allowed to buy two of each item. While most people went shopping, some just hung out on the street and tried to enjoy nature. Along the Xinjing river, several old men found their favorite spots and started fishing. Wang, 78, has been sitting here and fishing for over three hours, and has caught five big fish and three little ones. He is only allowed to be out for four hours each time by the community. With not much time left, he was hoping to get one more fish before heading back home. Wang was in the navy in his 20s, and he’s always felt a tight bond with the water. He said lockdown wasn’t too hard, except that he couldn’t go fishing. This is his second time fishing since the lockdown began. The first was Monday, May 23. “When people reach a certain age, it becomes hard to stay home all day. I need to get out, walk, and do some exercise. Otherwise, there’s not much I can do,” said Wang. “I’m so glad that I can finally go fishing again and breathe in some nature. Just being here makes me happy.” — Chen Si; editor: David Cohen.   May 26, 2022 In-Person Classes to Resume June 6 Shanghai is set to resume in-person classes for most high school students on June 6 after more than two months of virtual lessons due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the city’s education authority said Thursday. Similarly, those in their final year of middle school are allowed to go back to school on June 13. The city’s lockdown has disrupted class schedules for high school seniors preparing for the grueling college entrance exams, or gaokao. Those studying for the high school enrollment exams, or zhongkao, have also been affected. Shanghai postponed both the gaokao and zhongkao by a month in early May amid a worsening coronavirus outbreak. The exams will be held in July this year. Though students can return for in-person classes early next month, authorities also emphasized they wouldn’t be mandatory for now. Students and their families can continue opting for online classes. — Ni Dandan; editor: Bibek Bhandari.   May 25, 2022 View From a Pudong Mall It was drizzling Tuesday afternoon, but that didn’t dampen the spirits of some Pudong New Area residents from venturing to the mall. After all, they’ve been locked in for weeks. The upscale Taikoo Li Qiantan is the first such venue to reopen in the city’s financial district after nearly two months of lockdown. It opened its doors for visitors Friday. This week, many residential compounds in Pudong have been gradually relaxing restrictions and allowing people to step outside for a limited time — though days and duration vary from one community to another. They can walk, bike, or use their moped — not their cars though. A few supermarkets and convenience stores are open, along with the Taikoo Li Qiantan mall. At Taikoo Li, the three entries into the shopping mall were not as busy as expected. Before entering, visitors scanned their health QR code and had their body temperature taken. They were then given a sticker, indicating they were good to go. “It’s not busy on weekdays,” said a security guard. “But we received many visitors last weekend. Around 40 businesses in the mall have resumed operations —most of them are coffee shops, restaurants, and a few designer stores.” Most visitors walked around the mall and its outdoors space, taking photos and filming their first trip to a mall in weeks. Children in raincoats and boots splashed the rainwater in the puddles. Inside, most shops kept visitors a few meters away from their entrance. The shops also had QR codes for people to scan and place their orders online. A few people waited outside a designer store that was only allowing two to three customers each time. Some were waiting for their takeouts, as the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted in the air. “All of our pizzas are sold out,” said Hao Jie, a member of staff at a restaurant serving Western food, adding they ran out of stock in just three hours after opening on Tuesday. A receptionist at a restaurant serving cuisine from the southwestern Guizhou province said they were experiencing a staff shortage in the face of an increased demand for food. They were also having difficulties sourcing necessary ingredients for certain dishes. “But the reopening is a good start,” said the woman. The mall has banned indoor dining but there is an outdoor space that allows visitors to eat or drink. A handful of people lingered there despite the drizzle, and all had their masks on. While many had come to the mall for the first time since it shut in late March, some hadn’t left at all. A sanitation worker named Wang Xiafeng, along with some 30 others, have spent the entire lockdown inside Taikoo Li Qiantan. They lived in a designated area on the second floor and carried out their daily tasks despite there not being any visitors. “I chose to stay because I want to be fully paid,” she said. “For people like me, who are far away from home, the main purpose of life is to make money. Luckily, my income hasn’t been impacted.” — Ni Dandan; editor: Bibek Bhandari.   May 24, 2022 A Day Out in One District People chatting across a fence on a sunny day. A line at the grocery store. A strawberry ice cream handed to you at a convenience store door. It may sound normal elsewhere, but this last weekend in Shanghai, they felt like little miracles. After a few false starts, the reopening of Shanghai has begun, one downtown district at a time. Many residents of Changning, a district just northwest of the city center, spent the weekend outside for the first time in just over 50 days. This wasn’t the first time people have been allowed out, but it’s the largest scale move toward opening since the start of the lockdown. Across the district, communities allowed designated stores to open to locals, and issued exit passes allowing residents to go out. A few subway lines are even running, taking a few passengers to airports and train stations. It came as a surprise to us. Shanghai has laid out a rough reopening timeline for the end of June, but details are scarce, and the great majority of the city is still locked down. I got my pass Friday, and at first I wasn’t sure what I could do with it: it says on the back that each household is to send only one person to the shops every other day, for no more than three hours, and asks you to write what time you leave so they can check. The truth was a lot more accomodating. The next day, our “building monitor” handed us another pass and encouraged us to use them to take a walk — and we quickly found that we weren’t alone. There are checkpoints — I think they’re at the boundaries of the district — at which police ask to see the passes. And stores seem to take the restrictions seriously, turning away people without a local pass. And at least one subdistrict in Changning changed its mind Monday, telling residents their passes had been suspended. On our first walk, people seemed dazed. Last time we were out, the trees were bare; now it’s the humid start of summer. Many wandered in the middle of the streets, or stood taking pictures of once-ordinary scenes. Two women sat in a bus shelter, chatting as though it were a cafe table. Some streets were covered in the remains of months of delivery, with mountains of cardboard and styrofoam boxes cascading out of doorways. But by Sunday, the Shanghai spring felt a little more real, and we passed more people out for a promenade or a bike ride. We seem to have the run of the district for exercise, but we’re only allowed to shop in our own subdistrict, an area of about a square mile. It’s got a few convenience stores and a small grocery store with a prohibitively long line. The official list for my subdistrict includes a supermarket, but it’s not actually letting people in. Several nearby subdistricts even got to visit a Carrefour supermarket chain. A few restaurants and delis were open for delivery, but wouldn’t serve takeout to customers. You can go on an app and order a delivery driver to pick up some takeout and hand it to you. So mostly what there is to do is to walk. And people are walking. For now, that’s enough. — Dave Cohen; editor: Bibek Bhandari.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010404
35 Days and Counting: Living Inside a Shanghai Factory,,2022-05-23,"After over 50 days of a strict COVID-19 lockdown, Shanghai is preparing to gradually reopen the city and restart its embattled economy. So far, more than 4,400 factories have been authorized to resume production under strict anti-virus measures. This means many workers are not allowed to return home after their shifts and have to stay within the factory premises instead. But some workers had already been working and living in their workplaces since mid-April, when the city authorized a few companies to resume production. Sixth Tone spoke with some of them on May 13, and they still hadn’t returned home as of Monday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010396
Shanghai Lockdown Disrupts Wedding Plans on Day for Lovers,"With marriage registration offices largely shut, thousands of couples had to postpone their weddings scheduled for the special day.",2022-05-23,"Shanghai’s COVID-19 lockdown has spiked the plans of thousands of couples hoping to tie the knot on the country’s unofficial day dedicated to love. Most of Shanghai’s civil affairs bureau offices remained closed due to the lockdown on May 20, limiting couples from registering their marriage. Many couples across China pick “520” as their marriage registration date as its Chinese pronunciation sounds similar to “I love you” in English. Last year, 2,232 couples in Shanghai registered their marriage on May 20, according to official data, which is 10 times more than the city’s daily average number. But only a handful of couples from the city’s suburbs, where restrictions were relatively loose, were able to do so this year. In Chongming District, at least two couples were able to register their marriage on May 20, Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, reported. The local civil affairs bureau there had partially resumed work that day. Clair Cai in Pudong New Area was told by her local civil affairs bureau on May 18 that the office was yet to resume work. An officer on the other end of the line asked her to postpone the wedding instead. The 26-year-old told Sixth Tone that she had been planning her 520 marriage registration for a year. Last month, she stayed up late to secure a slot that usually gets taken in seconds. “Of course I felt very disappointed,” she said. “There is only one May 20 in the entire year. This will likely be my biggest regret of 2022.” The frustration of many couples not being able to get married on their desired date comes at a time when the country is witnessing a record low marriage rate. Only 7.6 million couples registered their marriage in 2021, a historical low since 1986 when the government started to record such data, according to official data published in March. In Shanghai, another woman surnamed Tang also said that her local civil affairs bureau in Yangpu District canceled her marriage registration scheduled for May 20. She said the couple also had to cancel their wedding reception planned for May 21. “I was emotional for two days,” Tang said, adding she hasn’t met her fiancé for two months. “We have now postponed all of our wedding plans to the second half of 2022.” Tang said she and her partner now plan to register their marriage on July 15, the seventh anniversary since they met. But she didn’t let this year’s 520 go to waste. On Friday, she decided to do her makeup, put on her wedding dress and veil, and took pictures. She then posted it for the world to see. “I don’t want our preparation to be in vain, so let’s take some pictures!” she wrote on her account on lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010391
Chinese Cities Raise Testing Frequency to Catch COVID Cases Early,A negative test result is required to access public transport or crowded spaces.,2022-05-23,"Some 20 Chinese cities and five provinces have implemented a policy of at least one weekly COVID-19 test, making negative results mandatory for all residents to access public transport and enter crowded spaces, as the country ramps up efforts to curb infections. Megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai now require residents to show a negative test result from the last 48 hours before entering public venues and using buses or metros. Residents in Hangzhou have been taking a regular COVID-19 test every two days since the end of April. Smaller cities such as Shijiazhuang in the northern Hebei province and Wuhu in the eastern Anhui province require residents to take a test every few days. The tests are free and part of the central government’s “normalized” testing plan to detect the coronavirus and cut off transmission chains swiftly. The highly transmissible Omicron variant has mostly led to asymptomatic infections lately, adding pressure on the authorities to catch such cases before spilling into a larger population. “Regular nucleic acid testing in areas where no outbreak has yet occurred but with a high risk of imported cases can help provide early warnings, better monitor any flare-ups, and detect potential risks earlier,” an official at the National Health Commission said Friday. Earlier this month, the central government vowed to set up thousands of COVID-19 testing stations in major cities. Residents would be able to access such booths around a 15-minute walking distance from their neighborhoods. “There are two testing spots near my home and I can almost take the test as soon as I arrive,” said Xu Yanran from Hangzhou, which now has over 10,000 testing stations. “Initially it was a hassle thinking about it, but I soon got used to it.” Many local governments have announced their own rules to streamline testing and punish those evading the tests. Some cities, including Dalian in the northeastern Liaoning province and Cangzhou in Hebei, are testing male and female residents on separate days of the week to better detect infections within families. Meanwhile, officials in Siping, in the northeastern Jilin province, said anyone missing a COVID-19 test would be fined an amount equivalent to the cost of a certain number of previous tests, according to media reports. A nucleic acid test now costs no more than 28 yuan ($4) compared with 200 yuan in early 2020. “Many local governments are using third-party agencies for regular testing, but the falling price of tests can result in less active participation,” Tan Xiaodong, professor at the School of Public Health of Wuhan University, told Sixth Tone. “Local authorities should also build up their own testing force.” However, analysts say that the government-funded mass testing could avoid leading to strict lockdowns and dealing a heavy blow to the economy. Nevertheless, costs involved in testing the entire population would also add pressure to the fiscal revenue of local governments. The regular testing mandate for all of China’s first and second-tier cities with some 505 million people combined could cost up to 1.7 trillion yuan a year, or 1.3% of China’s nominal gross domestic product last year, according to a May report published by Soochow Securities, which is less than the estimated economic impact caused by lockdowns. Shanghai, which is battling its worst outbreak since the early days of the pandemic in 2020, has been locked down for over 50 days, though restrictions are gradually loosening. In April, the city’s retail sales fell 48.3% year-on-year, while industrial production was down 61.6% as most of its residents were confined indoors, city authorities said Friday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010392
"Leaving Shanghai, At Last",,2022-05-18,"Many out-of-towners were in Shanghai for short-term visits when residential compounds started enforcing lockdowns even before the official announcement in late March. After being locked down for over a month, some of them are gradually finding ways to return home.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010360
Leaving Locked-Down Shanghai Is Hard. Returning Is Harder.,Limited transportation and unclear rules have kept many residents away from their homes.,2022-05-18,"When Yu Xiao left Shanghai for a vacation in the Tibet Autonomous Region, little did she know it would stretch for two months and she would be locked out of her hometown. Shanghai has been virtually disconnected from the rest of China since a lockdown was abruptly imposed on March 28. What was supposed to be a staggered nine-day shutdown has now lasted for over 50 days, disrupting daily life. Yu said all of the 10 flights she had booked from Lhasa to Shanghai between April and May were canceled. The flights were canceled from a week in advance initially to just within hours of departure time. “I feel guilty for not being able to be with my family in my home city during such a difficult time,” Yu told Sixth Tone, referring to the hardships millions of people have endured during the lockdown. Many out-of-towners stuck in Shanghai have described multiple difficulties in leaving, and those willing to return to Shanghai from other parts of the country face similar ordeals. A trip to and from Shanghai has become incredibly difficult as only a handful of flights and trains operate. On Monday, when the city government announced it would gradually reopen the city, only 16 trains carrying around 6,000 passengers departed from Hongqiao Railway Station, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper. Fewer than 1,000 people arrived at the station that same day. For context, Hongqiao Railway Station is Shanghai’s busiest transportation hub, ferrying around 160,000 passengers on an average day. With limited trains and almost no long-distance coaches running, Lu Xiongming has been unable to return home to Shanghai. The 60-year-old was in his hometown in the neighboring Jiangsu province to sell his apartment when the Shanghai lockdown was announced. “I thought of taking a train first to Nanjing, which still had trains to Shanghai,” said Lu, who moved to the city to live with his son’s family 10 years ago. “But my son reminded me of the increased health risks on the long journey. I’m worried about putting my young grandchildren at risk.” In Lhasa, Yu said she frantically followed the developments in Shanghai from her hotel, trying to figure out a way to return to her apartment. Aside from checking in on the flights, she also attempted to call her neighborhood committee. Neighborhood committees have mostly taken up the role of enforcing lockdown rules, as well as granting entry and exit approvals for residential buildings under their jurisdiction. Yu said she made “hundreds of calls” and was shocked to find out they had only let people out but hadn’t allowed those from outside the city to move in. “Their line was always busy,” she said. “They told me to first go to the front gate of the residential compound, and they would then help sort out the rest of the problem.” Yu said she was already losing patience and her savings. She was spending 800 yuan (around $120) a night for the hotel in Lhasa in addition to paying her rent in Shanghai. “The landscape is amazing in Lhasa, but the prolonged stay there was another type of isolation for me,” Yu said. “No one could share the same feelings.” Lu in Jiangsu said that he has spent the past month living with a relative there. He often calls his grandchildren in Shanghai but feels a void being in a place that was once home. “I don’t know what else I can do,” he said. “My social connections are almost all in Shanghai. I feel lost.” Lu is unsure when he might be able to reunite with his family in Shanghai. Yu, meanwhile, said she decided to gamble and flew to Hangzhou, an hour’s train ride from Shanghai, on Saturday. “I feel I’m almost halfway home,” Yu said, adding that she was still figuring out how to get into Shanghai after being away for more than two months. And even if she secures a train ticket to Shanghai, she’s worried about making it to her apartment. She lives 30 kilometers away from Hongqiao Railway Station, and there is currently no public transport running except for a few authorized taxis. Yu is now debating if she would be willing to walk or try finding a taxi driver who might make her trip easier. But she is still worried about whether her neighborhood committee would then actually allow her in once at the gate after all that effort.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010358
"Dining Out, Parks, Travel: Shanghai’s Post Lockdown Wishlist","As restrictions continue, residents in locked-down cities dream of normalcy, and simple pleasures.",2022-05-17,"As a new wave of lockdowns takes hold across China, the lives of millions more in cities have ground to a halt. In late April, as containment measures in Shanghai and its surrounding areas entered their fifth week, Late Post spoke to residents living in locked-down cities for extended periods of time about their experiences and what they hoped for once containment measures were finally lifted. These are their stories.  300 Day 26 of the lockdown: Zhang, who asked to be identified only by her surname, and lives on her own in Shanghai, still had 187 eggs left from the 300 she had stockpiled. Late in March, when she heard that someone in her small residential community had tested positive, Zhang, who recently quit her job, rushed to the supermarket downstairs. But the shelves had been picked clean; all that remained at the vegetable stalls were a few wilted leaves. A kind-hearted supermarket employee told her that a crate of eggs was still left in storage. Though Zhang rarely cooks and has no kitchen to speak of, she decided to take the crate and all the 300 eggs it contained. She had little choice. The next day, she tried to buy instant noodles, biscuits, some self-heating hotpots, and takeout food — all to no avail — before her community announced four more positive cases. Since then, Zhang hasn’t left her apartment even once. In the more than 20 days that followed, Zhang mostly survived on eating eggs boiled in a kettle. The first day was tough. It was impossible to cook them all the way through — the kettle automatically switched off the moment the water started boiling. So she was forced to repeatedly switch the kettle back on several times until the eggs were at least somewhat done. Her attempts at making poached eggs were similarly disastrous. In the beginning, she ate five eggs per day, which then went down to three, then two — and by the 19th day, she says, “I never wanted to eat another egg in my life.”  Rarely in all that time did she eat something else. On day six of the lockdown, Zhang found and ate a pot of instant noodles that was six months past the expiry date. On day 11, her neighbor left a bag of chips at her door. And on the 14th and 23rd days, respectively, she received packages from her neighborhood committee and took part in a group purchase. Only then, in addition to all those eggs, did her pantry also include rice noodles, a few cucumbers, eggplants, and carrots. However, since she has no kitchen appliances, Zhang only eats reserves that don’t need to be cooked. But after exhausting her supply of fruits and vegetables, she was forced to go back to the dreaded eggs. Of late, Zhang says she has often had nightmares about the pandemic lasting a century. When jolted awake, she sits by the windowsill, unable to get sleep, and waits for the sun to rise. She’s currently reading “The Plague” by Albert Camus. One line from the book stuck with her: “The habit of despair is worse than despair itself.” On the day the containment measures are finally lifted, Zhang dreams of eating a big meal, but without any eggs. Then she hopes to relax in the park. She also wants to spend a whole day at a café, doing nothing — just watching the clouds in the sky, the cars in the street, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk, as well as listening to the sounds of the city all around her. That’s all it will take for her to feel happy. She misses her mother’s wonton soup, her father’s braised pork belly, and the various delicacies at the city’s little roadside stalls and holes in the wall. Since March, she’s repeatedly told her parents: “Everything’s fine. I have enough to eat and drink — it’s just a little boring having to stay at home.”  This too shall pass Asked where he would like to go once Shanghai’s lockdown is lifted, an elderly resident surnamed Chen didn’t reply. Asked again, he simply said, “Nowhere.” And what would he like to do? “Just drift along.” Chen turns 84 this year. A decade ago, he and his wife moved from an old lane house in Puxi to the 24th story of a resettlement home in Pudong as part of a resettlement project. During the interview, Chen’s residential complex had already been locked down for more than 40 days. And the care packages he’s received from his neighborhood committee leave much to be desired: “Chinese lettuce stems a foot long,” a few packets of tissues, about one kilogram of flour, and a few soda crackers. Both he and his wife have poor teeth, so before he cooks a meal, he needs to narrow the ingredients down — first, to whatever they can chew, and then, to whatever hasn’t yet gone bad. Moreover, Chen has fallen at home twice over the last month. “My hip problem is not going away,” he rues. According to his son, Chen has several geriatric diseases and was due to visit the hospital early in April for a follow-up, which never happened.  Chen now feels a little of what young Chinese people refer to now as sang: dejection. He spent his life being content with whatever he had. Whenever he’s frustrated about the lockdown rations, he thinks of how the Red Army on the Long March in 1935 only ate grass. On April 23, his building entrance was fenced shut. The day before, his grandson got a friend to send him 60 eggs, four cartons of milk, as well as some cereal and stuffed buns. Chen shared some of these rations with another elderly neighbor downstairs. All considered, he’s mostly calm. He’d learned something decades ago, during the great famine from 1959 to 1961. Then, he was in his early 20s: “Even natural disasters pass,” he says.  Drawing on memories On April 2, a Shanghai cartoonist under the pseudonym Woshibai, which literally translates as “I am Bai,” wrote in his journal: “With no cars on the road, the skies are so blue.” The day after, he added: “The sky is still blue.” Since the lockdown began in mid-March, he says he’s lost all notion of time. “Yesterday afternoon was only a heartbeat ago, while tomorrow will be here in the blink of an eye,” he says. A self-described homebody, he spent most of his last six years drawing illustrations at home. But lately, he’s begun to feel stifled, and spends more time on the balcony looking longingly out the window. In the building across, he’s also spotted more people looking out than usual. When the measures are lifted, he wants to see a doctor about a few minor ailments. Of late, he’s noticed some swelling on the back of his knees, but from the confines of his apartment, all he has been able to do is search online. “If nothing else, I have learned that this part of the body is called the popliteal fossa,” he says. He’s also looking forward to a few games with a ping-pong buddy he only recently met. He recalls riding home after one time they’d played together: the sun was just setting as office workers clocked out and flooded onto the street. As he sped down the road, he saw scenes of the city sweep by in his peripheral vision. Though he let his mind wander blissfully, he kept a safe distance from the truck ahead and avoided all potential dangers, however minor. During the lockdown, he has enjoyed reliving every detail of such memories. He hopes to spend an afternoon sitting idly in the café next to his apartment building, as well as mingling with crowds in the street to redirect his attention away from himself and back toward the outside world. He also wants to go to this one particular public restroom. “I prefer squat toilets — so it makes my walks outside not completely without purpose,” he says, smiling.  Pyramid of needs For the past month and a half in Shanghai, Zhao Chen has learned to measure time in intervals of “four to five days.” As the group-purchase leader of his small residential community, he organizes new bulk orders based on these intervals. Zhao, 36, works for a foreign automobile company. Until recently, in the 23 years that he’s lived in this community, he hardly ever interacted with neighbors. But now, to organize the bulk purchases, his WeChat contacts have grown by 52 groups and 325 friends. With each extension of the containment measures, he says, “The things I have helped purchase have gradually moved higher and higher up Maslow’s hierarchy.”  One neighbor wanted a birthday cake, an item few crave for, so he went to great efforts to organize a group purchase of Basque cheesecakes. In just one day, he managed to get 45 people on board. He’s also succeeded in buying something he never thought he’d get his hands on during a lockdown: a few vinyl records. The owner of the vinyl store he frequents always looks out for the regulars. “If you order just one record, he’ll still offer delivery — and if you buy several at once, he’ll even subsidize the delivery fee. He just wants everyone to have an easier time,” says Zhao. Zhao’s daughter was born after the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. At two, she is restless and can only crawl back and forth on the balcony while she watches birds and cats. His daughter actually loves getting the regular COVID test, says Zhao, simply because it’s her only opportunity to go outside. Once the measures are lifted, Zhao hopes to take her to the aquarium, the Jing’an Sculpture Park, the flower market, the art gallery, and to get ice cream. He also wants to ride his bike all around Shanghai. “I want to feel the rhythm of the city, without a care in the world,” he says.  Like a rolling stone Originally hailing from the southwestern city of Chongqing, Huang Linhua has been a taxi driver in Shanghai for three years. He rents a 10-square-meter room in an urban village in Huangpu District, where he rarely met his neighbors before the pandemic. Until April 1, that is, when his urban village was locked down. The cost of goods in Shanghai has since soared. For more than three weeks, Huang did not eat a proper meal — he could not afford to. In all that time, he ate just one bowl of plain noodles each day. If he was still hungry, he tried to sleep it off. Sometimes, he slept until midday, or even until the afternoon. “You don’t feel the hunger when you’re asleep,” he says.  On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, Huang noticed many people receiving supplies of cooking oil, rice, and meat, and yet, he had nothing. It made him feel like Shanghai was indifferent to him. About two weeks into the lockdown, he got his first package of rations: 10 eggs, two tomatoes, two cucumbers, and two baby cabbages. He still spends his days listlessly in bed. “It’s like a cat is clawing at my heart,” he says. His rent sets him back 1,200 yuan ($181) a month. He told his landlord that things were difficult at the moment and asked for a month’s extension. His request was denied. “I’m in utter despair. For someone like me, being deprived of my income for a month has made my life completely unsustainable. Locked up at home, I feel like I’m waiting around for death,” he says. He’s looking forward to three things when the measures are lifted: pay back his relatives the money he borrowed when his mother recently had to go to hospital, eat a meal of rice and braised pork belly (made at home, as eating out is far too expensive), and save up about 10,000 yuan or so before heading back to his hometown. Once back home, he vowed never to return to Shanghai. On April 24, his company finally got him a lockdown pass. Once he completes disease prevention training, he can start earning again. He was so excited that, when he called us, he had to choke back tears.  Between Shanghai and a hard place As night fell on March 16, Su, a truck driver from the central Henan province, bid goodbye to his family and drove his 17.5-meter-long heavy-duty vehicle to Shanghai. To save on toll fees, he stayed off the expressway en route to the city. As he drew closer to Shanghai, the roads became increasingly deserted. “More and more cars were driving in the opposite direction,” he says.  Before leaving, he knew the pandemic had flared up again in the city, and just the day before, officials had announced more than 20 new cases. But based on past experiences, he believed that as long as he had proof of a negative result from the past 48 hours, he would face no trouble getting in and out. But this time, the customer who received the goods told him Shanghai could potentially be locked down. “Unload and leave immediately,” Su was told. But Su wasn’t quick enough. He had only made it to Kunshan, about 50 kilometers away in the neighboring Jiangsu province, before his xingchengma — the nationwide travel history code — was updated to include his visit to Shanghai. He was left with two choices: go straight back home and into quarantine, or turn around and stay in Shanghai. Quarantining in Henan would cost 260 yuan a day, whereas this job would earn him 2,000 yuan once the cost of gas was deducted. Quarantine also meant he would not earn more money, and, in fact, would lose him around 1,000 yuan. Su chose to pull over at a pit stop along an unfinished expressway in Kunshan, which is popular among stranded truck drivers because nobody bothers them with parking, and there’s a supermarket nearby. After two weeks, the record of his visit to Shanghai had finally disappeared, but then Kunshan was locked down and truck drivers weren’t allowed to leave. Nowadays, he wakes up every morning on the small divider behind the driver’s seat, chats with the other drivers, scrolls on Douyin, and sometimes tries his luck at fishing in a nearby stream. He uses a butane stove he keeps in his truck to stir-fry meals, but to save on fuel, he usually only eats raw ingredients dressed in sauce, as well as steamed buns. At first, he took a COVID test every day; now, it’s once every two days. Though the testing facility is over three kilometers away, he always walks since every kilometer he drives costs him 3.5 yuan. Once the measures are lifted, he’s looking forward to eating hot rice and noodles in the comfort of his home in Henan. When he discovered that he had nothing clean to change into in his truck, he suddenly realized that he hadn’t bought new clothes in several years. Stuck in Kunshan, he’s thought a lot about how, in the past, he was always too preoccupied with making money. He’d drive all around, and money was the only thing that his family saw home on time. He says, “I’ve never lived life for myself. I suddenly feel so exhausted. All these years don’t feel like they were worth much.” Reporters Yao Yinmi, Zhu Kailin, Gong Fangyi, Shen Fangwei.

"Shanghai Sets New ‘Zero-COVID’ Target, Plans to Reopen Schools",Officials say they aim to get the number of new COVID-19 infections outside quarantine down to zero by mid-May and begin reopening schools as soon as possible.,2022-05-13,"Shanghai announced Friday that it aims to reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases at the community level to zero by mid-May, and that it will prioritize reopening schools so that students can prepare for the upcoming national exams. The city — which has been under a strict citywide lockdown for more than 40 days — has reported a sharp drop in new cases this week, after imposing even tighter restrictions in some areas last weekend. Only six community-level cases — meaning infections discovered outside a centralized quarantine site — have been reported over the past three days. The city said just over 2,000 new cases were uncovered in total on May 12, down from a daily peak of around 25,000 cases in early April. Officials said that suppressing the virus will remain their top priority, but that they plan to start getting some students back to class as soon as they can. “Priority will be given to juniors, seniors, and junior high school students who have to take the college entrance exams and secondary school exams,” a city official told reporters. The statement follows Shanghai’s decision to postpone the all-important high school and college entrance examinations last Saturday. Students will now take the exams in July. It is the first time the exams have been postponed since 2020, when China was still recovering from its initial COVID-19 outbreak. Shanghai will allow other facilities to resume operations “according to changes in the pandemic situation,” officials said. They plan to focus on reopening public transportation services, supermarkets, hospitals, and hairdressers, they added. Karina Kong, a third-year high school student in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone she hasn’t received any updates from her school on the government’s plan, but that she hopes to go back to school as soon as possible. She is currently preparing to take the college entrance exam and has been attending classes online since March. “It’s definitely more efficient to prepare for the exam in school,” she said. “Only being there provides the right atmosphere for studying.” Kong said the severe lockdown, which was initially supposed to last for just a few days, has disrupted her studies and caused her a lot of anxiety. “Seventeen and 18 should be the best years of our lives,” she said. “It’s a shame that we have to spend them in front of a computer.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010334
Tesla Finds Reopening In a Closed City Isn't Easy,"As many auto factories are cleared to reopen, they need to find parts and workers.",2022-05-13,"“Industrial production is a continuous process...Even if just one raw material out of the ten runs out, you have to stop,” Zhao Lei, a senior executive at a global sealing technology company, told Sixth Tone. Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory cut most production this week, days after resuming on April 19, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing an internal memo. The city government gave the green light for 666 companies, including Tesla, to resume production on April 16, of which 40% were automakers and related companies. But industry insiders say companies like Tesla are struggling to operate in a closed city, for reasons ranging from supply chain disruptions to missing workers. Tesla’s problem appears to be securing car parts. Aptiv, a vehicle component manufacturer, stopped shipping some parts from a Shanghai plant that supplies Tesla and General Motors over the weekend, after COVID-19 cases were found among its workers, Reuters wrote on Monday. Tesla didn’t reply to Sixth Tone’s request for a comment by the publication time. The Shanghai Gigafactory was closed for 22 days following the lockdown in Shanghai, reducing output from around 60,000 units per month to 10,757 in April. “They would normally ship the April production to Europe, but they didn’t ship anything that month,” Tu Le, managing director of consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights, told Sixth Tone. Tesla’s Shanghai factory was reported to have loaded 4,767 electric cars onto freighters Wednesday, headed for Singapore. The auto industry relies on a web of specialized factories producing different components of a finished car. “We’ve only recovered 20% of our capacity in April,” said Zhao, whose company is part of Tesla’s supply chain. The enterprise managed to keep some of its staff in the factory when the city imposed a comprehensive lockdown at the end of March, and further reopened on April 21 after getting the green light from the local government.  Wang Jianfeng, a department head at Zhao’s company, has been living in a meeting room for the last month and a half. He told Sixth Tone that he worked over 12 hours per day amid the closed production and has had to take over the work of absent colleagues. “I know we (the enterprise and the employees) are in the same boat,” Wang said. “I’ve missed my wife and children despite having calls with them on a daily basis.” Production could be brought to a halt if a single kind of raw material runs out, Zhao said, telling Sixth Tone that some production lines could only last for two to three weeks if supply chains are cut. Zhao said he has been working in the factory together with his workers since the enterprise reopened in late April, spending most of his days attending meetings and contacting clients and suppliers. Even if a supplier is working, moving the parts from one factory to another can be a major challenge. The government issued permits allowing manufacturers to hire designated drivers and vehicles. But Zhao said he’s desperate for logistics companies to return. Hiring his own fleet of trucks can only support short-distance journeys, and costs are very high due to a shortage of drivers. “For larger enterprises, they will come to the factory and pick up the goods on their own,” Zhao said. Logistics got “a little better” in May, as major delivery enterprises gradually resumed business, and the company obtained a permit at the beginning of May. Zhao added that transporting some special raw materials such as dangerous chemicals required an additional permit for transportation, thus creating a lot more difficulties in finding a suitable driver. Since those dangerous chemicals can’t be stored in large amounts, that also increased risks of crippling the production line. A shortage of workers is also hobbling the reopening progress. According to work resumption guidelines, workers need a negative COVID-19 test result from within the past 48 hours to return, and the building they live in must have reported no positive cases for seven days. Once they leave home, they won’t be allowed to return. Zhao said the implementation of the policy varied by neighborhood, with local authorities imposing tougher restrictions. The company managed to bring around a quarter of its workforce before being cleared to reopen, and around 30% as of now. Zhao added that workers have been eager to reopen and voluntarily worked overtime in return for extra wages, but he expressed concerns that the stress of being cooped up for a long time has affected the mental wellbeing of individuals and caused work efficiency to drop.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010329
National Omicron Outbreak Could Kill Over 1.5 Million in China: Study,A study published in Nature Medicine identified low vaccination among the elderly and limited access to antiviral drugs as key barriers to safe re-opening.,2022-05-11,"An unchecked wave of COVID-19 in China could kill 1.5 million over six months, as the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant overwhelms the healthcare system, a team of scientists in China and the United States concluded in a draft study released ahead of publication by the journal Nature Medicine. The authors aimed to forecast the outcome of a move away from the country’s strict zero-COVID policy, which relies on lockdowns and repeated rounds of citywide testing. “Should an Omicron variant epidemic be allowed to spread uncontrolled in mainland China, we project 1.10 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants over a six-month period,” the authors wrote, adding that most deaths would occur among unvaccinated seniors. Demand for intensive care beds could peak at more than 15 times current capacity. In the United States, COVID-19 killed 0.57 people per 1,000 between Dec. 15 and April 15; since the start of the pandemic it has killed almost 1 million people, or 3.33 people per 1,000. The study used a simulation based on data from Shanghai and places which have endured major Omicron waves, including Hong Kong. It identified low vaccination rates among people over 60 as one of the biggest contributors to the danger of an Omicron wave. Although more than 88% of China’s population had been fully vaccinated as of mid-April, only half of people in their 80s and above were fully vaccinated, according to data from the national health commission. China’s vaccination strategy initially prioritized “key groups” most likely to get or spread the virus, such as warehouse workers and people involved in cross-border trade, rather than the most vulnerable. The study modeled several “mitigation strategies”, including vaccination campaigns, antiviral drugs, and “non-pharmaceutical interventions,” such as social distancing. No measure taken alone lowered the predicted death rate to levels comparable to flu, but the authors found “When both vaccine uptake in the elderly is substantially increased (97%) and 50% or more of symptomatic infections are treated with antiviral therapies, the peak occupancy of ICUs may not exceed the national capacity and the death toll may be comparable to that of seasonal influenza.” Beijing has ratcheted up restrictions amid a local outbreak, while most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents have entered their sixth week of lockdown as daily cases dropped to a low of less than 1,500 on Wednesday. In an article published in the medical journal Lancet last Friday, a medical advisory team including Zhang Wenhong said the zero-COVID policy will buy time for the country to build an immunological barrier, as some 49 million elderly people aged 60 and above have not been vaccinated. In a Tuesday media briefing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said the country’s COVID-19 strategy is not sustainable given what’s known of the disease, while other officials from the organization suggested the issue of human rights should also be taken into consideration for the policy. While stressing the importance of filling the vaccination gap among the elderly, the Nature Medicine study also suggested the need to tailor interventions to different regions given the diverse and complex immunological landscape across the nation. Developing more efficacious vaccines and strengthening critical care capacity should also be key priorities, the study said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010311
Shanghai’s ‘Psychological Emergency’ Warrants Attention,The city’s mental health hotlines have recorded increased calls from residents seeking help amid COVID-19 lockdown.,2022-05-11,"Zhao doesn’t remember what day of the week it is anymore when she wakes up — every day more or else feels the same. The Shanghai resident has been confined to her apartment for nearly six weeks as the city of 25 million fights a decisive battle to eliminate COVID-19 cases. But thousands of city dwellers are fighting another battle, against mental health, as lockdown-related uncertainties have increased anxiety and other conditions. “I’m losing interest and don’t want to do anything,” the 28-year-old, who lives with two roommates in downtown Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “I don’t know what day it is, and I cry when I read sad news.” Shanghai has been under a strict lockdown since late March to contain what has become China’s worst COVID-19 outbreak since the pandemic started. Though daily infections have been gradually declining, with the city logging fewer than 1,500 cases for the first time in weeks on Tuesday, residents are largely still barred from leaving their homes.  Over the past few weeks, some neighborhood communities have even tightened restrictions by imposing barricades and fences. There were even reports that all residents in the building where an infected individual lived would be transferred to a quarantine camp, though the government later clarified that the rule was theoretically only applicable for those sharing a kitchen or bathroom. “I couldn’t sleep at all that night,” Zhao said, adding she was anxious after reading such news and watching other distressing videos on social media.  Shanghai was already witnessing an uptick in mental health issues during the first few days of a lockdown that was initially supposed to last from March 28 to April 5. The city’s government-run and private mental health hotlines received an increased number of calls from people with various lockdown-related anxieties. COVID-19 and the lockdowns imposed to contain infections have dramatically affected the mental health and wellbeing of millions of people globally. The first year of the pandemic saw a 25% increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.  In Shanghai, as the lockdown continues with no end in sight, experts have been warning of similar surges in people requiring mental health screenings. Chen Jun, chief physician at the Shanghai Mental Health Center, said Monday the lockdown would inevitably result in fear, anxiety, and depression among residents. He added they were a common psychological response to long-term stress. “These emotions are understandable after a long period of isolation, but most of them are mild, short-lived, and have little impact on our lives,” Chen said during a press conference. “Most of us can return to normal through our own adjustments.” But not everyone copes with mental health issues in the same or even similar ways. Those struggling are reaching out to counselors, mostly through mental health hotlines.  Qiu Jianyin is a supervisor at Shanghai’s government-run 24-hour mental health hotline that has 350 operators. In April, when coronavirus infections were surpassing 25,000 for days, the center received thrice as many phone calls compared with other times. Over 80% of callers shared problems related to the outbreak. “Shanghai was in the ‘psychological emergency’ stage in April,” Qiu was quoted as saying in a video published by state broadcaster China Central Television earlier this month. In May, when the pandemic eases and the city gradually returns to normal, new emotional problems might arise, resulting in psychological problems that would require society's acute attention, Qiu said. The government-run hotline received 300 to 400 calls daily during its busiest period in April, according to its manager Jin Jin. They, however, gradually dropped to about 200 in the third week of that month. “It takes about 20 minutes to answer a call usually, and longer calls may take 30 minutes,” Jin told Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, in early May. “We listen to them talk, vent, and even complain. We try our best to answer or solve their practical problems.”  But not everyone is willing to pick up their phones to talk to a stranger on the other end of the line. Zhao said she tried calling a mental health hotline once before but it “didn’t make any difference.” Meanwhile, Chen Aiyi said she instead complains and vents her lockdown frustrations with friends and her daughter. The 60-year-old in Xuhui District is often worried about securing daily supplies, even though deliveries have relatively improved from last month. “I fight for food on the shopping app at 6 a.m. every day,” she told Sixth Tone. “I get depressed when I don’t get anything.”  Chen said she is also often anxious while waiting for nucleic acid test results that residents are required to take frequently, sometimes imagining symptoms such as sore throats and headaches. She’s also been concerned over the prospect of people entering her apartment to disinfect it.  “I’m afraid they will destroy my furniture and valuables with no way to complain afterward,” she said. “A lot of people around me are very tense.” Whenever such thoughts cross her mind, Chen said she often distracts herself by reading or gardening with her husband during the day. Shen then spends the evening watching TV late into the night, trying not to scroll through distressing news and videos likely to induce anxiety.  Shanghai’s 24-hour mental health hotline can be reached at 962525. Phone numbers for the city’s other hotlines can be found here and here.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010303
Applying for a Chinese Passport? You May Need a Fake Job Offer,China has stopped issuing passports for “non-essential reasons” as part of its “COVID-zero” policy. The result: a thriving market for fake foreign documents.,2022-05-10,"Like many people in China, Christina is desperate to visit her family members living overseas. There’s just one problem: the government refuses to issue her a new passport. China stopped approving passport applications for “non-essential reasons” in 2021 as part of the country’s virus-control campaign. Citizens are now only granted a passport if they have an urgent need to travel abroad, such as an offer from a foreign university or employer. The policy — which is designed to prevent imported COVID-19 infections by restricting international travel — has led to a dramatic drop in new approvals. In the first half of 2021, China only issued 335,000 passports — 2% of the total for the same period in 2019. Christina is among the many Chinese citizens affected by the new restrictions. The 30-something lives in Shanghai with her husband, an American national. She hasn’t seen her parents-in-law, who are in their 70s, for three years due to China’s strict border controls. She has been trying to renew her passport since 2021, but her repeated calls to the immigration authorities have gone nowhere. Every time, the officials tell her that her situation is “not urgent,” she says. With only two months until her current passport expires, she’s becoming increasingly anxious. “I asked them what is considered urgent,” said Christina, who spoke with Sixth Tone using a pseudonym to protect her privacy. “They told me it would only be if I could provide documents proving that my in-laws are severely ill.” Christina is far from alone. A travel agent, surnamed Zhou, told Sixth Tone he receives around 30 enquiries every month from people asking for help getting passports issued or renewed.  Most clients are Chinese citizens who want to visit family abroad, says Zhou, who gave only his surname due to the sensitivity of the issue. Many are parents who haven’t seen their children for years, as they have been studying overseas, he added. There are over 700,000 Chinese students studying abroad, according to official data released in late 2020. For many applicants, there’s only one way to get around the restrictions: fake it. On Chinese social media, users are swapping tips on how to secure a passport by hiring agents to forge job offers or overseas school applications. Li, a 37-year-old from the eastern Fujian province, is one of them. After her initial passport application was rejected, she hired an agent to provide a fake offer from a foreign kindergarten. She then told the authorities she needed to accompany her child to study abroad. The officials were strict, Li said, asking her to provide an invoice from the kindergarten, a student certificate, and a bank statement, among other documents. But after five visits to the immigration bureau, she finally succeeded in renewing her passport. She plans to emigrate to Canada in the near future. Lydia Lin, a 36-year-old from Beijing, managed to renew her passport on Sunday after telling officials she plans to attend a Chartered Financial Analyst exam overseas. After verifying that she has a finance degree, the authorities granted her application. “I think this policy is quite unreasonable,” said Lin, who also plans to use her passport to emigrate. “It is a citizen’s right to travel across borders.” Christina doesn’t have a finance degree or a child, but she has also been researching ways to circumvent the rules. She’s considering a variety of options, from getting a foreign medical document saying that an in-law is severely ill, to buying a fake job offer from an agent. The restrictions aren’t just affecting her, Christina added. Her husband is afraid to leave China without her, as he’s worried about the unpredictable travel situation. A positive COVID-19 test or a slew of canceled flights could leave him stuck outside the country — and the couple separated — for months. “The policy has brought so much uncertainty into my life,” said Christina. “We’re having a baby later this year. If I can’t manage to get a passport, I don’t know when my child will be able to see their grandparents.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010293
Escaping Shanghai’s Lockdown,"Losing income and patience, some freelancers are finding ways to leave the city for work.",2022-05-10,"Paloma Fu had the option of taking a stroll in Shanghai’s streets last week just as her neighborhood in Xuhui District temporarily relaxed some COVID-19 restrictions. Instead, the independent advertising director spent the day planning to escape the city.  Two days later, she hopped in a car to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, where she boarded a train to the coastal city of Xiamen, some 1,000 kilometers away. “I have to resume shooting,” the 28-year-old told Sixth Tone from a quarantine hotel in Xiamen on Sunday. “We can’t work from home. We earn our salaries through on-site projects.” Fu is one of many in the advertising industry — including photographers, stylists, and cinematographer — commissioned by domestic and international brands. But with the lockdown now in its sixth week, she said many brands have canceled their shooting in Shanghai and commissioned projects elsewhere. For many in advertising, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen have emerged as lucrative alternatives to Shanghai, Fu said. She and her three peers followed the strategies of those who had already left the city, whom she called “escapers.” “Hundreds of independent directors, producers, and cinematographers, as well as some film equipment rental companies, are on the move, either taking high-speed trains or rental cars,” she said.  Many people wanting to leave Shanghai were said to have mostly misinterpreted the city government’s announcement from April 15, saying that the city would allow those “who meet conditions” to leave Shanghai for where they lived or worked. But amid confusion, Shanghai authorities clarified on April 25 that people were not allowed to leave the city unless necessary. The previous policy, officials said, was only applicable for people with no fixed address in Shanghai. Currently, there is no official approval process for leaving Shanghai. Permission is often granted by neighborhood committees provided that their counterparts in the other city are also willing to accept the traveler. Fu said the group of four who traveled together secured their permits and started their 20-hour high-speed train trip to Xiamen — it usually takes just over six hours — on Friday, with a transfer in Wenzhou. The trains were specifically designated for those leaving Shanghai, and no other passengers were allowed to board during stopovers along the route. Though the lockdown has disrupted regular schedules, there are about 10 daily train services from Shanghai to other cities, according to the official railway ticket booking website. However, seats are limited and often get snapped up in seconds once they go on sale. Fu said she and her peers bought tickets from travel agents for about twice the original price. She then had to hire a car that was allowed to operate during the lockdown to get to the station. The entire trip cost around 7,000 yuan ($1,040), including a 14-day hotel quarantine bill in Xiamen, Fu said. She added that others who end up renting a car to their final destination had shelled out as much as 20,000 yuan. Fu said the expenses were a fraction of the money she and her peers would have lost if they had continued to stay in Shanghai without regular work. However, she acknowledged that finding work would be relatively more difficult than before having escaped from the locked-down city. Just hours before her Xiamen trip, the international company that commissioned the advertising project canceled their shoot and only reimbursed some of the expenses. But she and her team decided to travel anyway. “My contacts say that global brands are cutting advertising budgets in China,” she said. “Staying here and waiting for Shanghai to open up won’t bring me any income.” And Fu said more and more people just like her in her professional circle were also leaving or trying to leave Shanghai for work. But some neighborhood committees, including hers, had stopped issuing exit permits over the weekend. Many taxi drivers had also stopped taking requests after being warned and fined by police officers. Fu follows the conversations in a WeChat group. While some like her have left, others are online night and day, trying to get on any available train. “Those who are still planning the trip are very anxious,” Fu said. “They feel like the policies in Shanghai and the receiving cities can change at any time.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010289
Shanghai’s Lockdown Rules Aren’t the Same for Everyone,"While some neighborhood committees allow residents to step outside, others are even prohibiting group purchases for daily essentials.",2022-05-09,"Shanghai resident Jiang Mina was waiting for government food rations Monday after her neighborhood community restricted bulk buying and ordered residents to stay indoors until May 15. Her community hadn’t logged any coronavirus cases for the past 14 days and had previously enjoyed some leniency. “The food left in my fridge can only support my family of five for another two days,” she told Sixth Tone, adding they were allowed to make individual purchases but it was extremely difficult to secure them due to high demand. “We couldn’t have survived without the government supplies.” Across the Huangpu River in Pudong New Area, Hu Qing received a similar notice Sunday evening. Her neighborhood also told all residents not to step out of their homes until May 15.  Daily coronavirus cases are dropping in Shanghai, and the level of restrictions have largely been dependent upon various neighborhood committees in the city’s sub-districts lately. In the past few days, some have tightened measures to minimize the risks, with the aim of eliminating the virus in their communities in the coming week. Jiang lives in a neighborhood in Xuhui District that has logged fewer than 10 COVID-19 cases among the 1,000-plus residents since March. Nevertheless, her neighborhood committee tightened restrictions over the weekend. “Previously we were allowed to have activities within the neighborhood,” she said. “We feel it’s quite safe because we don’t have any COVID-positive neighbors or need to deal with the potential risks that group purchases could bring.” In Pudong, Hu said residents can still make purchases through group buying in her community. On Friday, they were even allowed to go outside their compound for two hours to shop in some of the stores that have been allowed to reopen. But Hu instead chose to walk her dog by the riverside and enjoy the afternoon breeze and sunshine. “I have sufficient food supplies,” she said. “My neighbors provided various resources for us to purchase what we need.” So far, Hu’s community has only had four coronavirus infections, and she believes the neighborhood community has been generously lenient. “There was basically no restriction on what type of commodities we can group purchase,” she said. “We were having sports activities like badminton, basketball, and football before the most recent quarantine measures.”  But the situation hasn’t been the same for others. Liu Fanle has stayed indoors since April 1. She lives in the downtown Jing’an District and said she’s mostly unsure about the COVID-19 situation in her community. “None of the households in my building were ever infected, but there are 40-plus other buildings and hundreds of other families living here,” she said. “When I called the neighborhood committee for the information, they refused to tell me and said it involves people’s privacy. I just want to know why I can’t even take a walk in the neighborhood.” As most of her neighbors are older residents, Liu said her community has basically relied on government supplies. Many didn’t actively participate in group purchases due to the minimum amounts required to participate, which some considered costly. “In the past week, two batches of government supplies arrived. The supplies can support the basic demands of many people living here,” she said. “But there’s more than just getting fed.” Meanwhile, Hu from Pudong didn’t have qualms about the recent strict measures. She said they have enjoyed little freedoms such as walking inside their compounds and were ready to temporarily stay indoors again. “Most of my neighbors have been supportive of the latest move because it somehow gives us hope that we’ll probably be able to get back to a normal life in mid-May,” Hu said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010287
China’s Cinemas Are Struggling,"With extended closures and few new releases, COVID-19 and lockdowns have hit the country’s movie business hard.",2022-05-07,"It’s been a rough few years for Chinese cinemas. “Whenever there is an outbreak, cinemas are the first to be shut down, and the last to reopen,” said Qu Lei, a movie theater manager in a city in Jiangsu province, who used a pseudonym as she is not authorized to speak to the media. The 39-year-old told Sixth Tone that her cinema has been closed four times since it was founded in December 2019. It was shut for about half a year in 2020, for two months last year, and twice since the start of March for more than 50 days in total. The latest shutdown was from April 27 to Thursday. About a third of the country’s movie theaters are currently closed due to Omicron outbreaks. But industry players say they have broader worries about winning back audiences. A dearth of quality films and competition from emerging entertainment genres could break China’s theater-going habit, they say. Dark screens The industry was growing quickly until the pandemic: Screens in Chinese cinemas increased by over 13 times from 2009 to 2019, to nearly 70,000.  But box office sales were hit hard during the Labor Day holiday, which ended Wednesday, usually a lucrative time for the country’s film industry. All cinemas in Shanghai have been closed since mid-March, while Beijing also shut its movie theaters during the holiday. Total box office revenue for the five-day period dropped 82% to 297 million yuan ($44.5 million) year-on-year, with 67.6% of cinemas in operation, according to leading film market data service provider Dengta. Qu told Sixth Tone that her cinema has cut full-time staff by about a half, to 10 people, over the past two years. Payroll still costs over 100,000 yuan a month, according to Qu. The theater reopened for two days in late April between two shutdowns, bringing in daily box office revenue of over 20,000 yuan. That would have been a lackluster performance last year, but it was enough to rank among the top cinemas in the country April 25. “The figure proves that audiences aren’t ditching cinemas and movies,” Qu said. Qu said she’s less anxious than she was in early 2020, when the reopening date kept being put back. What worries her this time is a lack of quality new releases to show when she resumes operations. “The film market will remain weak unless there are new movies that really make people want to come to theaters,” she said. “Before that, even if we reopen, the box office revenue will not be very strong.” Dong Wenxin, another cinema manager in the eastern city of Ji’nan, whose theater has been shut down since March 31, wrote in social media posts that the largest problem of China’s film market is that movies don’t meet the tastes of the audience. “Films have value. They’re one of the reasons life is enjoyable,” she wrote. “The audience is always there, but the market isn’t offering them what they want to see.” Coming soon: not much Theater closures are contributing to a weak flow of new releases, industry insiders say. In the face of repeated closures, studios have made fewer films and delayed planned releases. Only three new films were released for the Labor Day holiday this year, compared to 13 last year. Zhu Yuqing, secretary general of the film division of the Beijing Cultural Industry Investment and Financing Association, told Sixth Tone that the repeated COVID-19 flare-ups have hammered the industry for two years, leaving many in the sector hesitant about developing new projects. “The previous shutdown in 2020 was like pressing a pause button,” Zhu said. “But this shutdown has impacted every link of the film industry chain, leading to stagnation in investment, production, distribution, and promotion.”  “Meanwhile, films focus more on social benefits than aesthetic and entertainment functions,” he said. “The young audience may stop going to the cinema if there’s just one genre that does not appeal to them.” China’s large screens have often been dominated by domestic patriotic movies in recent years. Blockbuster war films such as the “Battle at Lake Changjin” series and “The Eight Hundred” ​​have brought in hundreds of millions of yuan at the box office. ​​ Wen Te, who has 10 years of experience in film distribution, told Sixth Tone that he was concerned that young people would turn to other leisure activities if things don’t improve. “During the shutdown in 2020, cinemas thought things would get better after it ended. But now they are afraid of resuming operations, as there are few new films and many cinemas will run at a loss,” said the 33-year-old. An April report on the development of cinemas in 2021 by cultural consulting firm Top Century warns that new forms of entertainment such as live action role-playing murder mysteries, and escape rooms are taking the place of movies for some young people. Despite uncertainty over future prospects, Qu hopes that her cinema will reopen soon, with better domestic films and more foreign films. “We need to concentrate on creating good content and keep the audience in mind. Films are made for them,” said Zhu.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010275
Chinese Band Uses Lockdown Metaphors as Tour Titles,Backspace postpones domestic concerts amid the coronavirus outbreak with a fitting name for their rearranged tour: “Let’s Try Again.”,2022-05-06,"A Chinese indie band is using their tour names as metaphors to describe the country’s COVID-19 lockdowns, highlighting measures that limit the mobility of millions. From last year’s “Now I Am Outside” tour to this year’s “I Can Finally Go Outside,” Beijing-based Backspace has used titles to reflect the times of cities being entirely shut down at short notice. With more and more cities in lockdown and most entertainment venues shut, the band said Thursday it would postpone this year’s tour until November. The four-member band also renamed their multi-city tour to “Let’s Try Again.” Though playful, the titles for Backspace’s shows indicate the growing frustration in the country’s entertainment scene that has been hit hard by the lockdowns. The country’s vibrant music scene and many venues have fallen silent in recent months as cities scramble to contain new waves of COVID-19 outbreaks. Shanghai and Beijing are currently under strict restrictions as coronavirus infections disrupt daily life. Members of Backspace told fans they were unable to leave the capital since late April and had to postpone the tour. “The world is impermanent, and the future is long,” said the band when replying to one comment. Backspace declined Sixth Tone’s interview request, citing “considerations of other matters.” China’s live music industry has been hit hard since the pandemic started two years ago. In 2020, China saw fewer than 1,000 live music performances, compared to over 30,000 in 2019, according to consulting firm iResearch. The shows largely returned to the pre-pandemic levels last year when the country managed to keep the virus at bay, though recent outbreaks have once again slammed the brakes on the industry. Meanwhile, more artists and music companies have turned to digital mediums to stream their performances.

"In Shanghai, Homeless Delivery Workers Are Surviving on Free Takeout","Many delivery workers have been sleeping rough for weeks, as they’re unable to enter their residential complexes during the lockdown. Local residents are trying to provide them with bedding and hot meals.",2022-05-04,"As Shanghai’s lockdown stretches into its fifth week, thousands of delivery workers have become a lifeline keeping the city running. Many are zooming around the metropolis for over 12 hours a day, delivering necessities to the city’s 25 million residents who have no other way of accessing supplies. Yet, despite being hailed as the city’s “unsung heroes,” many riders are living and working in dire conditions. Considered an infection risk, delivery workers are often banned from entering their own housing compounds by local residential committees. Instead, riders have been sleeping in cars, underpasses, or on the street — often for weeks on end. The issue came under the spotlight after reports emerged of several dozen delivery drivers sleeping under a bridge in the central Putuo District. The story sparked widespread public concern. Many residents organized deliveries of bedding, food, and face masks to the drivers, hoping to make their situation a little more bearable. Among them were Jennifer and Sy, who gave only their first names for privacy reasons. After reading the news, the American couple launched a fundraising drive among their close friends. For the past week, they have been using this money to purchase meals and other supplies for the drivers. Jennifer and Sy spoke with Sixth Tone about the project and the living situations of the drivers they’ve been helping. This is their story, edited for brevity and clarity.  The pandemic has obviously put everyone living in the city in an uneasy situation. For ordinary people like us, stringent prevention measures and insufficient food supplies have added a lot of stress to our lives. However, it is even more draining to see people not getting enough help and suffering from more severe consequences at this time. So, when we saw the video on social media, we decided to do something to help. We initially discussed sending a package of frozen dumplings, but then we noticed the drivers might not have the cooking resources available, so we ordered some hot meals online instead. That was when we met Zhu. He picked up the delivery order from the restaurant, and told us he was living under the bridge together with some 20 or 30 other delivery workers. He accepted the package with gratitude, and said he was happy to undertake the delivery if we would like to provide hot meals for them. We realized we needed more money, and decided to ask our friends if they would like to donate some. We didn’t aim to make it a big project, so I wrote a brief note and only shared it with our closest friends in a small group on the social app WeChat.  We planned to donate 1,000 yuan ($153) at first, but within three hours, more than 10,000 yuan had arrived in our payment account. We didn’t expect the message to travel that fast and far. A girl from neighboring Jiangsu province reached out to us on Instagram and asked if she could join the group. She said she just wanted to help. The first order went out smoothly. Zhu created a WeChat group to communicate with the other drivers. He picked up the meals and distributed them on a daily basis after we placed the order with the restaurant, which gave us a discount. When we talked with Zhu and other drivers, we were able to get a better understanding of the challenges they’re experiencing at the moment. Many have been living on the streets and under bridges for three to four weeks. To keep up with demand, they work over twelve hours a day and have not been able to shower or eat properly. But we were also deeply touched by their sincerity and kindness. When we were added to the drivers’ WeChat group, we were welcomed with great appreciation. They tried to send us a fruit basket as a thank you, but we kindly turned it down. It was great to see how they have banded together to confront their difficulties. A man in the group asked us if we could provide an extra bowl of rice. He wanted to give it to the homeless guy who also slept under the bridge. I always knew delivery workers were extremely hardworking. However, this situation just proved it’s on another level. It’d be great to meet Zhu and the other drivers when the lockdown ends. Perhaps we’ll grab a meal together after they’ve had time to rest up.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010226
Beijing Suspends In-Person Dining In Bid to Prevent Outbreak,The Chinese capital is shutting bars and restaurants for four days in a bid to avoid a major outbreak. It reported 59 cases Saturday.,2022-05-01,"Authorities in Beijing announced tighter restrictions on gathering during the five-day May Day holiday, as the city fights an outbreak. The city government ordered bars and restaurants to suspend in-person dining from May 1 to the end of the holiday. The city also recommended that restaurants make more prepared and semi-prepared dishes, and urged residents to “cook at home” to reduce the risk of infection. The government said that restaurants have accounted for many recent transmissions. Parks, tourist attractions, and sports and entertainment venues will remain open at 50% capacity, and will require reservations. When the holiday ends on May 5, officer workers and students will be allowed to attend in person, but required to have negative nucleic acid test results from within 48 hours. People who enter various public places and take public transport will need a test within less than seven days. The city will offer free COVID-19 testing from Tuesday. According to the National Health Commission, 59 new local cases were identified in Beijing on Saturday. At a news conference on Wednesday, officials called on eligible people, especially the elderly and children, to get vaccinated and booster shots as soon as possible. Beijing has added 4,000 quarantine center beds, said Li Ang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, at the news conference on Saturday. The city is also planning to build more large makeshift hospitals, and some districts have started the work on site selection, planning, and reconstruction of shelter hospitals.“Don’t panic,” Li said. “There aren’t that many patients in Beijing, but we need to be prepared for a rainy day.” A Beijing resident surnamed Feng, who lives with her husband in Chaoyang District, the city’s largest and the center of the outbreak, told Sixth Tone that she and her husband went to the supermarket near their home to buy some frozen food and fast food on the evening of April 24, shortly after the government announced that three rounds of mass COVID testing would be conducted in the district starting April 25. “Everyone around us was discussing stocking up, and many people were panic-buying,” Feng said. Feng, who owns a small company, decided to let all her employees work from home on Friday. Feng said her biggest concern was the effect on business. “Because of the epidemic, many of our projects have been unable to move forward,” she said. “Half the employees are required to quarantine at home, and there is no way to find out if they can come to work.” Feng and other residents of Chaoyang District have already done three mandatory nucleic acid tests. Two more district-wide COVID-19 tests will be held on Sunday and Tuesday. Another Beijing resident, surnamed Yang, whose community has no confirmed cases so far, visited the Summer Palace with his friend Sunday, the second day of the Labor Day holiday, but said he would spend the rest of the holiday at home. “I think today will be our last day (of freedom). Then we’ll go into a state where we can’t go anywhere at any time,” Yang said. “Restaurants have been closed and parks will follow.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010252
A Small Border City Grapples With Post-Lockdown Survival,Some business owners in Dongxing are considering shutting shops and even relocating.,2022-04-29,"While the lockdown in China’s financial hub of Shanghai is taking a direct hit on the country’s economy, local businesses in far-flung smaller cities are scrambling to survive even after the relaxation of stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Dongxing in the southwestern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region lifted some of its virus control measures Sunday after a two-month lockdown. But some residents in the city of 216,000 people bordering Vietnam said they found themselves in limbo and were considering shutting their businesses amid uncertainty over future lockdowns. Their stories offer a glimpse into how local businesses in small cities, especially those sharing borders with other countries, are grappling with gloomy future prospects. The frequent virus flare-ups, which authorities have often blamed on imported cases, followed by the abrupt lockdowns have dealt a blow to their economies, which are largely dependent upon tourism and cross-border trade. Ruili in the southwestern Yunnan province bordering Myanmar has gone through nine rounds of lockdowns totaling 160 days since 2020, according to domestic reports. The city has gradually resumed work, production, and businesses since mid-April, but residents have complained that persistent lockdown-like situations are disrupting daily life and livelihoods. In Dongxing, authorities have imposed two lockdowns since the pandemic. The first shutdown in December 2021 lasted for about half a month, while the latest two-month lockdown went into effect on Feb. 25. Official data shows Dongxing’s annual import and export volume has been shrinking since 2020, with the 2021 figure down by 40% compared with 2019. Meanwhile, revenues from domestic tourism dropped by 29% year-on-year in 2020, compared with a 37% growth rate in 2019. And business owners like Liu Gang are feeling the brunt. The 53-year-old has been running a local specialty store in Dongxing for 12 years but is now ready to pack his bags and head to his hometown in the northeast when his store lease expires this year. Liu said nearly a half of more than 1,000 small business owners like him had closed their stores in the past two years, as domestic tourists fell by 80% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Most of them have shops at wholesale markets at a Dongxing port near the border often frequented by tourists. “If the situation hasn’t improved by the end of this year, I would rather leave,” said Liu, adding that he has had about 40 nucleic acid tests in the past two months. “I thought the pandemic would end in a few months, but never expected the impact to last for years.” Liu earned about 3,000 to 5,000 yuan ($450-755) a month by selling bracelets, jade, and handicrafts before the pandemic. In mid-2020, he closed two of his three stores to save rent as income shrank. He renewed his annual rental lease for his remaining store last November, but business has since come to a screeching halt. The lockdowns have swallowed most of his savings — Liu only has 5,000 yuan left which he can stretch for four more months. “I cut monthly expenses on food by half to around 1,000 yuan,” Liu said. “I cannot be at peace of mind when buying food supplies and have to plan for the next few months when I may fail to make money.” Mei Rong, a Dongxing native who runs short-term rentals, said she was ready to close her business, but felt unsure of the next step yet. “I don’t know what I can do here, as we mainly rely on tourism,” said the 34-year-old using a pseudonym for privacy concerns. “But it’s a difficult choice to leave my hometown where I grew up, live, work, and have a family. I’m really confused.” Mei said she was among the first group of people in Dongxing to open a hotel in 2017. The city saw over 100 hotels in the following years, and her two apartments with eight rooms were mostly booked during the holiday season. She also hired temporary help during those seasons, providing employment for locals. But Mei’s apartments have been vacant since late last year. She said her business is running at a loss and is struggling to feed her family of four while paying the mortgage, which together totals around 6,000 yuan. “I was optimistic at first about the latest lockdown, but I had a mental breakdown after being confined at home for over a month,” she said. “There were still new cases, and we saw little hope. We don’t know when life can return to normal.” Both Liu and Mei are waiting for further government notice to resume business. So far, local authorities announced a one-time subsidy of 60 yuan per person during the two-month lockdown but have yet to roll out any relief for local businesses. “We understand the importance of lockdown in Dongxing to curb imported infections, but the question of how to prevent the virus while ensuring local residents’ livelihoods needs more attention,” Mei said. “I hope to start my businesses soon — it’ll at least support daily expenses despite having no profit,” said Liu. “A store supports a family. If it makes no profit for two years, not two months, many would get into trouble.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010248
What Shanghai’s Locked-Down Residents are Trying to Buy,"With food supplies disrupted by lockdowns, Shanghai communities have improvised their own delivery networks. Sixth Tone sister publication took a look at these numbers with an online survey.",2022-04-29,"This spring, community group buying has been ever-present in the lives of Shanghai residents. Since 5 a.m. on March 28, 2022, Shanghai has been divided into two zones, with the Huangpu River as the boundary. The east bank, Pudong, was locked down first, joined by the rest of the city on April 1. For most of the city, peering out of the window is the only way to see the outside world as almost everyone is stuck at home, with nucleic acid tests the only opportunity to step outside. Most food deliveries have been forbidden, and parcels stopped. Instead, people turned to grassroots bulk buys organized via groups in the messaging app WeChat for goods to be delivered to their neighborhood. A team of volunteers then delivers the goods to everyone's doorstep. To even succeed in getting a group buy, one has to fight against the flood of messages in the neighborhood group chat and sign up quickly, or risk going hungry. Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, conducted an online poll about group buying during the Shanghai lockdown and received a total of 1,020 valid responses. The questionnaire targeted Shanghai residents and used voluntary response sampling. It was conducted using ResearchWorks, Credamo, and The Paper’s account on Toutiao between April 12 and April 19, 2022. It was geographically screened to remove respondents who were not in Shanghai. Of the 1,020 valid responses, 473 were female, 537 were male, and 10 were of other genders. The majority of those who completed the questionnaire were young adults proficient at using smartphones. The conclusion of the questionnaire is limited by its sampling method and the ages of people who responded. How did you first join a group chat for group buying? Yao is 71 years old and lives alone in Pudong where she is quarantined. Her apartment compound has been locked down since March 16 because of positive cases. “All at once, vegetable markets and supermarkets were all empty.” Before lockdown, she was afraid to join the crowds of people who were panic buying and believed there would always be a way to get food. Two days later, the person in charge of their building sent several QR codes to the building’s WeChat group. “One popped up and I clicked it. It showed a nearby supermarket we could buy from, and I succeeded during the first group buy.”  Of the 1,020 respondents, 982 people joined group chats to take part in group buying. Less than 10% were told about them by local authorities. There were 813 people who kept up to date with what was going on in their neighborhood before the lockdown, either in a group chat or through direct contact with their neighbors. After the lockdown, nearly half of these found group buys through neighborhood group chats. The remaining 391 found groups through personal recommendations or WeChat Moments. There were 169 people who did not have the contact details of anyone in the community before the lockdown. One of these was San San, who lived together with her husband and mother-in-law, and usually had little interaction with neighbors. On the day of lockdown, San San’s mother-in-law went downstairs to line up for groceries and was spotted by her neighbor, Yao. “She queued up several times! I thought it might be because she didn't know how to use her phone, so I went to find her daughter-in-law,” Yao said. She then knocked on San San’s door, asked for her WeChat contact details and told her about not having to queue. Some people asked neighbors they bumped into about the WeChat group for where they lived, while others used functions for finding people nearby and sending private messages through video apps Douyin and Kuaishou to find out how to join the relevant WeChat group. Five people responded that they created their own groups. Weibo user “Rigo_” wrote online about her friend’s experience of starting a group buy arrangement. Living in a small neighborhood and without anyone else organizing, she made a simple poster inviting people to add her on WeChat and posted it on the public notice board by her door. People then joined the group and then added other neighbors. Eventually, it became the neighborhood’s group chat. How do people succeed in buying things? As of April 19, 195 people said they did not have enough supplies. Sometimes, hunger is very real , such as a family of three having to share a single pack of instant noodles, or a stomach that “growls even though there is nothing to eat”, as one respondent described. Another person had to get up in the middle of the night to cook and trade cigarettes for a fish. Other times, hunger is a sense of uncertainty that hovers overhead. Nobody knows when the lockdown is going to end. San San spent more than four hours a day keeping up with group buy news in the first three days of the lockdown. Someone opened their refrigerator every day and counted what was left to work out how long they could eat for. During this time, cell phones are the key to survival. There were 423 people who joined more than five groups for group buying on their phones. However, with frequent updates in the WeChat groups, important information can often get lost in the gossip and questions of the residents. Not keeping up with the latest updates about group buys in the group chat may lead to you going empty-handed.  Even young people are struggling to keep up with group buy messages, and many elderly people are not in the groups at all. Many interviewees mentioned that local neighborhood committees reached out to elderly people who were living alone to send some extra supplies. Other people would also give extra supplies to the neighborhood committee so that they could be passed on to the elderly.However, living on the supplies given out by the neighborhood committee is no easy task after nearly a month of lockdown. This issue has also attracted the attention of other domestic media outlets, one of which interviewed 51 elderly people living alone during the lockdown. Ten of them live in the same building in Pudong with no elevator. Bao was the only elderly person in the building who had tried to join a group buy but she was kicked out five minutes after joining the group because she could not figure out how to set her alias in the group. Statistics show that Bao is atypical in being an elderly person in Shanghai with a smartphone. What’s “essential”? In almost every community, there is a rule that says “only essentials allowed.” People are afraid that if the group purchase is not completely sterilized, the community will have more positive cases, running the risk of the 14-day quarantine starting all over again. Also, if too many group purchases arrive, the delivery volunteers will be overworked. But what’s “essential”? Of the 971 respondents who participated in group buys, they identified staple food items such as vegetables, meat, rice, and noodles as essentials. Only 27.6% bought bread or pastries.  Yet for the elderly, bread may be more important than rice and noodles. One user wrote in the comment section of the podcast “Random Fluctuations” about a 90-year-old man who asked the guard at his compound for help. “The government does distribute supplies, but the old man has no teeth and has to eat bread soaked in milk.” Several interviewees said that their community helps elderly people to buy medicine. Jindi said, “The neighborhood committee has a special group in which they register what medicine each elderly person or patient needs every day. After collecting the information and prescriptions, they go get the medicine and also call ambulances for people who need to go to the hospital.” The city is also home to many young people who have never cooked and may not even have cooking utensils. In one interviewee's neighborhood, there was a person who didn’t cook and didn't have pots or pans at home. Before the quarantine, he didn’t stock up on enough food and had to ask the volunteers for help. The volunteers called everyone to make a donation and somebody donated a pot. According to the co-occurrence results of the group buying items, those who bought bread also bought a variety of frozen instant food, which may reveal a preference for food that can be eaten at any time and does not require cooking. In these times, there’s no need to season or worry about it being cooked perfectly when the most important thing is to avoid going hungry.  In addition to having a full belly, people have a variety of “non-essential” needs, such as a bottle of Coke, a packet of cigarettes, a game of indoor badminton, or being able to stroke a kitten. This has given rise to residents bartering with each other about what they want.. Some exchanges are more casual, with people making offers and requests in the group chat. If someone is willing to strike a deal, one person puts the goods at the door for the other person to come and get it. Some exchanges are more formal and are recorded in spreadsheets, as is the case in Jindi’s building. Bottles of Coke are not easy to come by and are the “hard currency” when bartering. They can be traded for almost anything: ribbonfish, chili, coffee, or vegetables. One respondent traded a bag of chips for an hour of a cat’s company, while another traded a ribbonfish for a bag of cat litter. With the lockdown dragging on and it being difficult to buy daily necessities, anything can run out, such as the tube of toothpaste that you always thought you would have enough of. In this case, you might have to barter with your neighbors to see what you could exchange for another tube of toothpaste.  Perhaps what makes us the happiest is not necessarily what can be bought in bulk in WeChat group chats or by bartering, and that is certainly true for Yao, who said that the first thing she will do when the lockdown is over is to go back to her home in Puxi and indulge in some of her favorite food and drink. “I’m looking forward to palmier cookies from the International Hotel, then cake with some coffee.” A version of this article originally appeared in The Paper.

Shanghai Lockdown Is Now Part of Animal Crossing Game,Creators channel their lockdown experience to build a virtual island on the popular Nintendo Switch game.,2022-04-28,"Houses are sealed by green fences. Entertainment venues are shut. Trucks face roadblocks. The typical scenes from locked-down Shanghai have made a virtual crossover. The familiar setting is now part of a fictitious island in the popular Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Behind the virtual reality is Laura Liang and Josh Jiang. The Shanghai couple has recreated their experience from the COVID-19 lockdown, now in its fourth week. “Everything in the game is a déjà vu,” Liang, who is now in her 30s and works for an advertising agency, told Sixth Tone. The game was first released in March 2020 when the world was in the throes of the pandemic. Millions of players globally turned to Animal Crossing as an escape from reality where they could build their own virtual islands with activities ranging from fishing to farming and more. Though the game wasn’t officially available in China then, tens of thousands of people rushed to e-commerce platform Taobao to buy imported second-hand versions. The game hasn’t still been released in China, while those available on e-commerce platforms were removed in April 2020. Liang and Jiang said they picked up the game after a hiatus to toy around with their virtual island. The couple was in quarantine from March 20, as the city started locking down apartments where COVID-19 patients and their close contacts lived or visited.  “Since I haven’t traveled abroad in the past two years, I wanted to recreate the memories of various cities I have visited on this island,” Liang said, adding that their island is a mix of Japanese and European architecture. But little did they know that their virtual houses with green fences would reflect the situation that was unfolding. The fences were similar to those used to seal some of the houses on Saturday. “That green fence in the photo struck me because I have the exact same fence on the island — and our island is full of animals,” Liang said. “It couldn’t be more ironic.”  Liang’s husband Jiang then recorded a video of their island and shared it on his WeChat video channel called Snowthings on Sunday. “In order to prevent the epidemic from spreading to the Metaverse, I resolutely sealed the island in Animal Crossing,” Jiang captioned the video. The video plays out some of the familiar scenes from Shanghai’s lockdown. It opens with a news broadcast giving updates to the islanders and has scenes showing the island committee chief on inspection visits to quarantine centers, residential neighborhoods, and a farm.      As of Thursday afternoon, Jiang said the video had been viewed over 220,000 times. The couple said they have uploaded their island on the Animal Crossing cloud, which will allow other players to visit the island using the Dream function. The pair has published the Dream Code in the comment section of the video. “We just want to cheer everyone in a humorous way,” Jiang said.

The Small Group Rescuing Animals During Shanghai Lockdown,A Canadian who runs an animal aid organization in Shanghai describes how the team adapts to lockdown restrictions.,2022-04-27,"Shanghai’s lockdown raises two difficult questions for animal lovers: Who will feed the stray cats and dogs on the street, and who will take care of the pets at home if their owner is sent to a hotel or a quarantine camp? Lee-Anne Armstrong is one of many people working to solve both of these problems. Armstrong is the executive director of Second Chance Animal Aid, a nonprofit organization based in Shanghai. Second Chance runs a “virtual shelter” that places animals with foster homes while seeking adoptive owners. In an interview with Sixth Tone’s Wu Peiyue, Armstrong shares how her team continues to provide help to stray animals and pet owners. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Born out of SARS I’m from Canada, and a desire for change and new opportunities lured me to Shanghai in the summer of 2004. My intention was to stay two or three years. So much for the best-laid plans! I joined Second Chance Animal Aid (SCAA) in 2005. It was founded the same year by one of my friends who has decades of NPO experience. The reason was simple. At that time, I discovered that I was a magnet for needy homeless animals pretty much anywhere I went in Shanghai! One of the best contributions an organization like SCAA can make is sharing our experience, to help residents concerned about at-risk animals make a difference. It’s frustrating that with such rapid development, Shanghai is still without any animal welfare infrastructure. SCAA is part of a collective of animal welfare advocates trying to bring about change. The lockdown has really highlighted the challenges of being physically and financially responsible for so many foster animals in so many volunteer homes, spread across most districts of Shanghai. Ironically, it was the first SARS outbreak that provided some of the impetus for SCAA’s “virtual shelter” type of foster home network. But nobody could have predicted the harsh reality of our current situation. Pets and rescues in individual homes have been at greater risk of starvation and harm than we imagined. The threat of an animal’s only caregiver being taken away or our homes sprayed with toxic chemicals, while potentially helpful neighbors remain locked in, is a widespread and constantly shifting risk. SCAA needs to revisit the best way forward after seventeen years of the same formula. The lockdown has also thankfully highlighted how much community resources have grown, from more individual rescuers, vet clinics, boarding services, and animal-focused support groups across multiple social media platforms. Adapting to lockdown The original way of assisting cats and dogs doesn’t work anymore during the recent lockdown. When pet owners or foster parents have had issues that they sometimes needed urgent help with, you can feel helpless with all of us stuck inside. But we adapted to the new challenges as fast as we could. The severity of lockdown restrictions means that accessing and sharing information have become the most important ways to help pets and rescues. Only if people know what resources and strategies worked for others in similar situations, can we reduce the risk to all pets and owners. The indispensable collective helping pets stay fed, get medication, and — where needed — be safely moved when caregivers were taken to quarantine, includes a network of vet clinics, which are operating through online consultations, pet food suppliers, boarding kennels, volunteers, personal contacts, WeChat groups, cleaners, and drivers with an “epidemic pass” to legally be on the road. For homeless animals like garden cat colonies, we asked some compound security guards and cleaning staff to help with feeding. Our frequent outings for nucleic acid tests are opportunities to walk dogs and feed strays. The city’s job Heartwarming videos and photos of hazmat-suited volunteers walking dogs and feeding cats gave many of us hope that Shanghai would weather this lockdown crisis better than other cities did. However, many of the success stories, where stranded pets are finally provided with food and water after owners were taken to quarantine, are the result of social media embarrassment for property managers and neighborhood committees. Despite the ability to access pet owners’ residences to help as privately requested, many compounds and community leaders initially refused, until public pressure from pleas on Weibo or WeChat disclosing the pet owners’ home addresses, and sometimes the committee contact number, changed their mind. For some pets, it was too late. Although official notices are clear that people in the strictest lockdown are prohibited from going out to walk pets, this means different things to different authorities. Some tolerances are given. We see many variations even within the same sub-district. Some compounds stubbornly insist that pets can’t go out. Some compounds organize dog walking by dedicated volunteers in hazmat suits, while others simply turn a blind eye to a quick dog walk well away from anybody else outside. After I reached the city 12345 helpline, they kindly tried to organize help for our compound residents’ dogs. When the volunteer the city promised (twice!) was never actually assigned by our local unit, I was lucky to find discreet help from staff permitted to be outside in our compound. Clear, consistent, and reasonable policies to deal with pets would save everyone a lot of stress, time, hassle, and unwanted social media exposure. If things can get done after so much chasing and public pressure, there’s obviously a quicker, less painful way to make it happen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010208

Shanghai’s Graduating Seniors Worry About Grim Career Prospects,Many students are struggling to cope up with uncertainties as virus control measures affect companies and businesses.,2022-04-25,"As Shanghai is battling its worst COVID-19 crisis, the city’s graduating seniors are finding themselves at a crossroads.  With about two months until graduation, hundreds of thousands of university students are concerned about their employment prospects. Reports of massive layoffs at several top tech and education companies, as well as uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, have spooked students already vying with each other in a competitive job market. Sixth Tone spoke with three graduating seniors from the class of 2022 about how they’re navigating their future ahead.  Chen Yinheng, 22Undergraduate student at Shanghai University I’ve been confined to the campus for over 50 days since our university imposed a lockdown on March 2. I was planning to pursue a master’s degree after graduation because I would struggle with my current educational background to get a decent job in one of the big cities. But I failed the first round of the entrance exam. I’ve been searching for more postgraduate programs and jobs during the lockdown. I’ve sent my résumé to 33 companies since the start of my final year and had 11 writing tests and interviews in the past month alone. Sitting for exams and interviews usually requires a quiet spot, but finding a fitting place is tedious. It was draining to constantly ask my academic counselor or the administrator for a suitable place — they were reluctant to provide the space for fear of COVID-19 transmission. I usually have interviews in the dormitory, but it is awkward to dress in a suit and talk while my friends are playing games alongside me.  I can’t help worrying about my career amid the uncertainty. Getting cooped up with a limited food supply adds to the mental stress. I used to run at night to destress but it’s now forbidden. Now I just make short videos instead. I will continue looking for prospects in bigger cities though my friends have said it’s nearly impossible to find a satisfying job at the moment. My family has been supportive and are aware of how tough the job market is. But I’ve been annoyed by my academic counselor constantly tracking our employment status. The school called each of us a “genius” during orientation four years ago so it’s ironic that they’re now asking us to adjust our career expectations.  Chen Jiayi (pseudonym), 25Postgraduate student at Fudan University My job-hunting ordeal started last September. I still haven’t found a job that I’m satisfied with. I didn’t apply at the top internet companies during the fall recruitment period last year. But when I considered them during the spring recruitment period, I found several positions were no longer available. Competition is incredibly fierce in the current job market. When I applied for a job at Alibaba last month, I found myself surrounded by candidates from top domestic and foreign universities during a group interview. The pandemic has also lengthened the recruitment process, and waiting for the result is as painful as being rejected.  However, the lockdown has been a silver lining for me. It has slowed down the pace of life and I’m less anxious about my future. I suppose the pandemic has shifted my priorities from work to daily life. The outbreak has changed many people’s impression of Shanghai, but I still want to settle down here. After the lockdown is lifted, I want to go home in Gansu province for a while. I haven’t been home for over six months because I’ve been busy trying to find a job and finishing my dissertation.  Wen Qi (pseudonym), 21Undergraduate at Shanghai Ocean University I started my dream internship on March 3 just as the effects of COVID-19 became more visible. My university was sealed on March 7 after our school found a secondary close contact of a COVID-19 patient. I decided to leave the campus and rent an apartment to continue my internship despite being warned that I wouldn’t be allowed to move back. The plan turned into a disaster. After returning from a work trip to Chengdu on March 17, the place I intended to rent was sealed. It became extremely difficult to find a new one, as many residential compounds were starting to lock down. But I was lucky enough to stay with a friend. But the worst was yet to come. My boss decided to indefinitely “suspend” the internship due to safety concerns and operation costs. The position could have been a good stepping stone for my future career. I was also let go from my previous internship for similar reasons. It felt like a déjà vu moment. Amid the lockdown, I’ve found it difficult to focus on finishing my graduation essay and other assignments. I’ve been constantly worried about securing daily necessities, though group buying has eased the situation. I was planning to find a job in Shanghai, but now I’m considering settling down in Chengdu. I might return to Shanghai if Chengdu doesn’t meet my career expectations. But for now, I just want to go home to Guizhou province and take a long rest.

Meet the Grassroots Officials on the Front Lines of COVID Zero,"Low-paid and hard working, “grid workers” and “block captains” are the people who take policy to the residents of Chinese cities.",2022-04-24,"When she applied for the job five years ago, Wang Rui thought it would be stable, relatively easy work. She didn’t expect she’d wind up responsible for implementing China’s zero-COVID policy. “I’m now routinely working weekends,” the 36-year-old told Sixth Tone between dinner and a late-night meeting Tuesday. Wang is a wanggeyuan, or “community grid worker,” in Quzhou, a city of around 2 million in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Since the city’s first Omicron cases were reported in mid-March, Quzhou has confirmed over 100 COVID-19 cases. The city rushed to lock down its residential compounds. The city’s grid workers are on the frontline, responsible for maintaining order, making announcements, and arranging nucleic acid tests. Wang's counterparts in Shanghai, a city of 25 million currently in its third week of lockdown, have it even harder. Few residents knew their community workers — known in the city as kuaizhang, or “block captains” — until the present general lockdown. These previously forgotten grassroots workers have been pushed to the brink of collapse in the city’s fight with COVID-19. On the frontline Grid management was first introduced in 2004, when Beijing’s Dongcheng District divided its area into a grid and recruited officers to patrol each cell of the grid and detect problems. Originally, these officers focused on issues with street lamps, trash bins, and missing manhole covers. One officer is usually responsible for one apartment complex, or, if the complex is larger, some of the buildings in the complex. But their responsibilities have grown over the years. “We work to address conflicts among neighbors, and residents’ complaints about infrastructure and facilities. There’s also a huge amount of work when it comes to projects like the national census and ‘creating a civilized city,’” Wang said. “During special periods like the coming Asian Games and the annual Two Sessions, there’s additional work to make sure nothing goes wrong in our sector.” During lockdown, Wang is busy with organizing frequent rounds of COVID-19 testing and replying to residents’ questions related to the ongoing pandemic. One of the most common questions, she says, is whether people who were away from the city can return. In Shanghai, block captain Li Yingjun managed 21 buildings, home to 270 households, in an old compound in downtown Pudong before he resigned at the end of last month. Before he quit, he spent nearly two weeks inside the residential compound he worked in because of the severe outbreak of COVID-19 in the city. “Luckily, a warmhearted resident invited me to sleep at his home. I didn’t have to sleep in the office.” Community workers are not assigned to the compounds they live in, to prevent favoritism. Many have spent the lockdown period camping in their offices. “My health didn’t allow me to work like that anymore. My family has a history of liver disease. I can’t continue staying up late,” Li told Sixth Tone. “And I had to leave my parents at home, with no idea how to arrange group purchases, asking their neighbors for food every day.” After the lockdown started, the 39-year-old said there were just two people in the compound office responsible for a total of 530 households. “They complained about the shortage of daily supplies and essential medicines. There were endless calls to answer.” Li said, “In a crisis like the pandemic, our job is more to comfort residents. If you’re not familiar enough with the residents, how will they be willing or patient enough to listen to you? It’s easy for you to get into a quarrel.” Tough job Wang applied to take part in community work in 2017. She passed exams arranged by the district-level civil affairs authority. “I won’t say it’s a well-paid job. The income is all right. But most importantly, it’s a very stable job,” the woman said. She’s making around 4,000 yuan ($620) a month, which is a bit lower than the city’s average. The job’s biggest draw, says Wang, is that it offers an inside track into the civil service. ”In addition to stability, it promises career prospects,” she said. “If you pass special exams arranged for grassroots officers, you can join the civil service,” she said. “That means a significantly higher income. But there’s an age limit, which is 35,” she added. Wang Rui has missed the age limit. Instead, she’s hoping to be promoted to be the director of the residential committee. “I’m happy to work just inside communities for the rest of my career. But it’s always better to have a goal in mind.” A college graduate, Wang previously worked as an accountant at a small business. When she joined the neighborhood office, she was one of seven grid workers. Now, there are 10, responsible for nearly 7,000 residents. “In some parts of Quzhou, communities struggling to cope with the work of their full-time grid management officers hire residents to do the job. These temporary officers get stipends of around 1,000 yuan a month to provide support.” Each cell in Quzhou’s grid is composed of 300 to 500 households, and the city employs around 20,000 grid management officers, including temporary officers. Wang said the job was challenging for her at the beginning because she was too introverted to start a conversation with a stranger. “But that’s what we were supposed to do,” she recalled. “When I started, I visited the 300-plus households in my sector door to door. Understanding their family and making everyone know I’m their grid officer are the basics of my job. They know who to turn to if they encounter any difficulties in their community life,” she said. Wang is in dozens of local groups in the messaging app WeChat. Many times a day, she replies to the questions residents ask there. But in special periods like the recent outbreak of COVID-19, Wang said she personally cannot cope with the workload and has to turn to volunteers for help. “I’m managing a team of 40 volunteers. I gave them training on how to register people for the nucleic acid tests and how to arrange a line for the tests. It’s not that difficult,” she said. Grid workers are evaluated based on metrics including feedback from residents in their district and the physical condition of the buildings. “The evaluation doesn’t impact my income, but it’s more about the sense of responsibility,” she said. “You know exactly who are the residents you are responsible for and if anything goes wrong for them because of my work, I’ll feel extremely guilty.” Inside track to the civil service When COVID-19 first broke out in the central Chinese city Wuhan in 2020, grid management played a key role in the country’s first lockdown. The job is very popular in the city: in mid-2020, 3,800 people applied for 38 seats in Hanyang District. Wu Yufei, who became a grid officer last year in Wuhan, said she chose the job for its stability and ability to boost her chances of becoming a civil servant. “The grassroots experience will benefit me in my plan to join the civil service,” the 27-year-old told Sixth Tone. Wu worked two years in the real estate business before applying to work in grid management. “The competition in the civil service exam is too tough. It’s easier to get to that goal by first taking a job as a grid management officer,” she said. Li, in Shanghai, said when he joined community work five years ago, he didn’t see the job as a way up. “I never thought about promotion. I chose the job just because it is stable. The income supports basic needs,” he told Sixth Tone. He made 5,100 yuan a month, far below the city’s average. Before the pandemic hit, Li said, his sector didn’t have WeChat groups bringing its residents together. Instead, he coordinated with representatives from each building. “They’re almost all retirees, except one freelancer. Being the representative of a building requires lots of time and energy,” he explained. “They help to deliver messages from the residential committee to every household in that building. And our old buildings don’t have elevators. They visit neighbors door to door. These warmhearted neighbors don’t get paid except for some small gifts we give them around the end of each year.” It was not until mid-March when the buildings in his block created WeChat groups for all the people living there to join. Li was in each of these online groups. “I tried to answer their questions while I continued to receive lots of calls in the office,” Li said. “However, in Shanghai, many block officers are a mystery to their residents.” In other compounds, block captains have refused to join residents’ WeChat groups. “There’s so much going on and she didn’t want to engage directly with residents. That would mean a lot more workload and pressure on her,” a building representative in another compound in Pudong, surnamed Lu, told Sixth Tone. “The pay for grassroots officers was never in line with what’s asked from them,” Li said. “But with the full support from the neighbors, I spent the past five years working happily in the community. If it weren’t for the pandemic, I wouldn’t have quit the job. I loved working in that community and staying close with those neighbors.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010183
The Fitness Influencer Making Locked-Down Chinese Sweat,Liu Genghong has emerged as an unlikely entertainer through his viral workout sessions helping people keep fit indoors.,2022-04-22,"Millions of people under lockdown in China now share a common routine: A fitness session with their new star personal trainer Liu Genghong. The recently little-known Taiwan-born singer, actor, and personal trainer has turned into a viral sensation over the past weeks, as his fitness livestreams amass audiences from across the country. Many of them have been locked indoors for weeks as part of the government response to stamp out surging COVID-19 cases. The 49-year-old has also been in lockdown with his family in Shanghai, currently in its third week of a citywide shutdown. On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, Liu appears on short video platform Douyin — China’s version of TikTok — with wife Wang Wanfei at 7:30 p.m., though he makes his followers wake up early at 9 a.m. on Saturdays for a 90-minute session.  The couple is usually seen exercising to the fast-paced tune of pop singer Jay Chou’s “Compendium of Materia Medica” and others. Snippets of the workout where Liu appears in a red tank top and black slacks with his wife have since gone viral on social media, with people imitating the workout routine at schools, quarantine centers, and even while lining up for nucleic acid tests. Liu’s workout sessions have been so popular during the lockdown that they have broken Douyin’s livestreaming record for 2022 so far, according to data analysis platform Chanmama. Within one month, his livestreams have been viewed nearly 40 million times altogether, with his most popular session attracting over 1 million live views. Liu’s followers have also increased from 5 million to 33 million in just 10 weeks. His popularity soared especially following a workout on April 9 during which the couple were seen wearing a down jacket, supposedly after their livestream was disrupted for unspecified reasons. “It was really hot,” Liu told domestic outlet China News, recalling the experience. “But at the time, we couldn’t find out why the livestream was cut off. So we guessed it was a clothing issue, and we wrapped up our whole bodies in down jackets to amuse our audience.” Douyin did not respond immediately to Sixth Tone’s request for a comment by publication time. Liu Xixi, a 27-year-old Shanghai resident working in the medical sector, told Sixth Tone that she has been following Liu Genghong’s livestreams for a week now. She said the couple are fun to watch, especially for those looking for various ways to exercise while cooped up indoors. “I have been quarantined for nearly a month,” she said. “Working out every day makes me feel happier during the stressful period. It’s healthy for our body as well.” The online fitness business has seen a significant surge in China since the pandemic started in 2020. According to a March report by Douyin, the number of fitness videos in 2021 increased by 134% while followers of such content were up by 208% compared with the previous year. Liu Genghong isn’t the only icon who has been able to get the attention of fitness enthusiasts recently. With her workout videos, German fitness model Pamela Reif has also built a massive fanbase with over 8.3 million followers on social platform Xiaohongshu. Liu Genghong’s meteoric rise to fame has made him a household name, as well as another of the country’s profitable livestreaming stars. He reportedly makes some 240,000 yuan a day through his livestreaming session where fans shower him with virtual gifts that can be converted to cash, according to domestic media Chinese Entrepreneurs. Many online have even joked that the fitness instructor was now facing a stiff popularity contest with Li Jiaqi, the “livestreaming king” known for his sales tactics. “Li Jiaqi empties our wallet, Liu Genghong empties our body,” has become one of the most popular comments on microblogging platform Weibo lately.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010193
Lockdown on Aisle 5: From Shanghai Supermarket to Crisis Depot,Dozens of workers have spent weeks sleeping in their store to provide supplies to a closed-down town.,2022-04-22,"Once Wang Zhongkui’s phone started ringing, it wouldn’t stop. One caller was in desperate need of milk powder for her newborn; another asked for a phone charger so she could stay connected to the outside world. Quarantine centers required blankets, and construction workers building temporary hospitals called for meat and vegetables. Wang, 41, is the manager of an RT-Mart supermarket in Huinan, a Shanghai satellite town close to the city’s largest airport. Ever since the city locked down in the face of an unprecedented wave of COVID-19 infections, the massive store, with over 10,000 square meters of floor space, has been one of the rare businesses that has remained open. It was designated by the government as a supplier of essential goods. In early March, when Shanghai’s COVID-19 case counts began creeping up, Wang started sleeping in his office to evade the risk of being quarantined at home and jeopardizing his store’s operations. When the eastern part of Shanghai went into lockdown on March 28, he was joined by 105 employees. Over the past two months, the city has recorded over 400,000 cases. To many residents, the continuing lockdown has been characterized by problems with deliveries of food and other household products. In Huinan, many people would probably be worse off were it not for Wang and his workers camping out among the aisles for weeks. The following is Wang’s story, as told to reporters Ming Que and Wu Jiaying:  “The charger is important to her” I didn’t realize what was happening when I received the first call for supplies early in the morning on April 1. Only later did I realize that the government’s list of companies that would secure supplies during the lockdown period, which included us, had mistakenly listed my personal cell phone number.  From that first call on, it hasn’t stopped. Sometimes, I receive hundreds of calls a day. I was very moved when an anguished young mother called late one night, saying that her baby, who was crying in the background, was just 20 days old. She wasn’t producing any breast milk, and she had run out of formula. I remembered how my son would be when he was hungry just after he was born, and arranged a delivery for her. The phone calls came one after another, and I started to think about what people needed most urgently. Besides vegetables, meat, and rice, ready-made food is a life-saver for young people who can’t cook or who don’t have any pots and pans in their apartment. One young woman called and said that her cell phone charger was broken, and that she had less than 10% of her battery left before losing her lifeline to the world beyond her front door. There are also people who say they want cigarettes, lighters, and alcohol — but we don’t currently deliver non-essential items. When I get a call, I delegate the tasks: our employees are separated into teams that sort, pack, and arrange delivery of goods for residential communities, individual apartments, and businesses. After a few days, the government replaced my phone number with that of our customer service manager, and the number of calls to me slowly went down. Our store has a van with a lockdown pass, and it’s in use around the clock. The driver, Tang Feng, is a big-hearted guy. Before the lockdown started, he called me and said he didn’t want to hunker down at home. He wanted to help. He applied for permission, and went to live in the store with his wife. Now he drives hundreds of kilometers every day. The milk powder delivery for that young mother? That was him.  “Supermarket by day, bedroom by night” In early March, cases were popping up in Pudong, the eastern part of the city where Huinan is located, and government officials began locking down residential communities and businesses wherever they found infected individuals or their close contacts — under a policy called grid management.  I live in Yangpu District, about an hour away in the western part of Shanghai. Since March 5, I’ve only been back home once, to get clothes. I didn’t stay overnight. Around that time, one of our employees tested positive, was quarantined, and never came back to work. On March 12 we were informed that three people who had tested positive for COVID-19 had recently visited our supermarket. For two days, our building had to go into closed-loop management — collective quarantining with daily testing. Our supermarket is on the building’s second floor; the first floor has smaller shops and the third and fourth floors are the parking lot. I called everyone who had worked here during that week. We managed the quarantine of more than 650 people. In those two days, the workers on the first floor slept in their shops or in their cars. Most of our staff slept on makeshift beds on the floor of the supermarket and its office.  We resumed business on March 15. Every employee was required to wear a mask and maintain social distance, and the area was decontaminated daily. No one expected that positive cases in Shanghai would continue to grow, and that the number of neighborhoods under lockdown would increase by the day. It became difficult for employees to leave the supermarket, and fewer customers came in. At the end of March, another employee tested positive. The store hasn’t had any cases since then. On the evening of March 27, the government announced that all of Pudong was going into lockdown. We had just over four hours to prepare. We immediately got to work, putting all the basic necessities on the shelves.  A flood of people descended on the store. The government arranged for police and urban management officers to maintain order. We were open until 12:30 that night, selling out of most of what was on the shelves. Before the end of the shift, we had an emergency meeting to determine who would stay. Of the 170 people working the night shift that evening, 105 employees stayed behind. In the following days, as the situation in Shanghai became more and more severe, we let some people go back home to reduce the risk of infection in the store. Finally, we were left with 88 people. In accordance with Shanghai’s pandemic prevention policy, we do one day of nucleic acid testing, followed by one day of antigen testing, rinse, repeat. In the morning, we eat stuffed buns, milk and eggs. For lunch and dinner, we cook and stir-fry our own food, usually two vegetable dishes and one meat dish. The store has all kinds of fresh ingredients, and the staff in charge of the ready-to-eat food is here. The staff in charge of security can cook curry potatoes and sweet and sour pork ribs, which are pretty good. I appreciate their dedication and I thank them wholeheartedly for sticking with me. “Everyone is doing their part” Normally, our sales are predictable — but not anymore. For example, there is a centralized quarantine site in our town that suddenly needed a batch of quilts in the middle of the night; some construction site canteens suddenly doubled the orders of vegetables and meat; and there has also been a sharp increase in demand for milk powder and diapers. Early on, we prepared well, and built up sufficient reserves of rice, noodles, cooking oil, instant noodles, eggs, and other essentials. Vegetables, fruit, meat products and so on are a little bit tight, but we receive shipments every other day. We used to restock every day and could offer more variety, but we can’t do that anymore.  During the earliest days of the lockdown, we ordered vegetables, fruit, and poultry from areas neighboring Shanghai. But because Pudong was locked down, the driver would have no way to leave after entering the district. So we had drivers from Shanghai meet them right outside the city and pick up the goods. This way nobody had to quarantine. Recently, the Shanghai government took over management of the city’s wholesale vegetable markets, and we began ordering from them. In the beginning, we delivered mainly combo bags of vegetables, poultry, and meat. Later on, different demands gradually emerged, such as for fruit, napkins, instant noodles, milk powder, diapers, and so on. There were days when we took mainly group bulk orders — from a neighborhood, from volunteers, and from the government. When individual residents called, I suggested that they purchase through their neighborhood and we deliver uniformly to save on labor. The situation is slowly improving. The Huinan Town government took the lead and arranged for a logistics company to help with our deliveries. Since April 7, we have allowed online ordering. We have capped orders at 300 a day, and they are filled within minutes of opening up. By the 12th, we had sent about 30,000 orders into residential neighborhoods. At the peak, we were responsible for supplying 5,000 food bags a day. Among employees, spirits are good, all things considered. On the 12th, our headquarters bussed in two dozen employees from outside Shanghai to help with sorting and packing. They also brought masks, cotton gauze, and tents. Some of our employees who are in lockdown at home feel bored, and have offered to come back to work. The Shanghai government has asked us to increase supply, so they may be called in soon. Through all this, every retailer is doing their part. We are just a node in a network, a microcosm of the industry.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010186
How the Lockdown Is Remaking Shanghai Neighborhoods,Sociologist Sun Zhe has studied Shanghai community organizations for over a decade. He believes the ramifications of the current lockdown will be felt far into the future.,2022-04-20,"Late last month, Shanghai entered a “phased lockdown” as it confronted the country’s worst-ever coronavirus outbreak. The lockdown, now in its third week, has brought the lives of the city’s 25 million residents to a grinding halt. Although some neighborhoods have begun allowing residents to go outside for up to an hour a day, for the most part, only essential workers such as doctors, delivery drivers, and social workers are allowed to leave their homes. With e-commerce and food delivery platforms unable to function normally, to say nothing of supermarkets, the task of distributing food supplies to locked-in residents seemed at first like it would fall to the municipal government. When it became clear that local officials had too much on their plates — and residents not enough on theirs — communities citywide had little choice but to fend for themselves. The result has been an unprecedented explosion of grassroots mutual assistance and organizing in neighborhoods across Shanghai. The bulk of this activity has taken place on WeChat, the country’s ubiquitous chat app, as people join group chats with their neighbors to barter food, place large “group-buy” orders with wholesale suppliers — the only delivery service still running in much of the city — and share requests for help. Some of these groups are dominated or facilitated by officially recognized volunteers working with neighborhood committees: a theoretically self-governing body made up of and elected by neighborhood residents under the supervision of the subdistrict government. Others are wholly grassroots in nature. For many residents, the groups represent the first time they have ever engaged in community affairs — and possibly even the first time they’ve learned their neighbors’ names. To Sun Zhe, a sociologist who has spent 15 years studying Shanghai community organizations, the lockdown is both a crisis and an opportunity. Most middle-class Chinese live in gated residential compounds, “cities within cities” that are serviced by private property management companies who put the interests of property owners above those of renters. Prior to the lockdown, residents seldom interacted with their neighbors and the neighborhood committee played a largely invisible role in their lives. The recent outbreak, which has highlighted the importance of community solidarity in an otherwise atomized city, is reshaping Shanghai society in real time. Late last week, Sun sat down for a telephone interview with Sixth Tone in which he shared his thoughts on how the lockdown is changing Shanghai communities, why some neighborhoods have banded together while others have fallen to infighting, and why women are taking the lead in community organizing. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Sixth Tone: As a Shanghai resident yourself, what have you observed about community self-help and mutual assistance organizing during the lockdown? Sun Zhe: I’ve mainly focused on residents’ online activity. During the outbreak, I noticed many communities were creating WeChat groups for residents for the first time. These groups were typically set up by volunteers as they went door to door distributing at-home antigen test kits. While many communities previously had WeChat groups for homeowners, these typically excluded tenants and merchants. In the face of the virus, however, such differences in identity have been erased and all residents have been thrown into the same online communities. Within resident chat groups, there’s a class of volunteers who play a critical role as information screener, or xinxi yuan. Two of the problems people have faced during the lockdown are information anxiety and a lack of media literacy. Plugged-in volunteers sort through and summarize the large quantities of information published by media and government bodies, filtering through the endless waves of official messages and presenting the practicalities to residents, such as the schedule of that day’s COVID tests and material distribution. Not only do these volunteers help fill the communication gap between understaffed administrative agencies and neighborhood committees, but their non-official status also allows them to respond to people’s queries more flexibly and effectively than official sources. One woman I know volunteered to work as an informal information screener. She is highly adept at dealing with information and social media, but many other residents, including senior citizens, are joining large WeChat groups for the first time, having previously only used WeChat to message their families. For these people, the work of volunteer information screeners has been especially helpful in easing their anxiety. Sixth Tone: Joining a public chat group for the first time seems like an important step toward active community participation. Sun: That’s right. When someone joins a community group chat, they quickly find that the large group has sub-divided into many smaller ones, such as groups for buying food or organizing medicine deliveries. The problem with earlier, homeowner-centric groups was that they were based on the ownership of property. Discussions in these groups focused on complaints about property management services and the payment of fees. During the lockdown, however, members of the residents’ groups realized that homeowners, tenants, and traders are all part of the same community, and they all share the same interests. I think that these “communities of common destiny,” as some might call them, will remain even after the outbreak is brought under control. We will still face a variety of risks, including public security and fire safety. How should fire safety procedures and ventilation systems in residential communities be designed? Peoples’ memories of living together under lockdown will focus their attention on these issues, turning individuals into community members. Sixth Tone: Looking at the issue from another angle, when communities are large, it is inevitable for there to be conflicts of interest. For example, during the lockdown, there have been issues between buildings with positive cases and those without.  Sun: This is a key issue, which has its roots in lack of community trust. Shanghai’s citizens have demonstrated a strong ability to organize themselves during the outbreak, but it varies. Many resident chat groups went from zero members to organizing neighborhood group-buys in three days. That’s impressive, but I’ve also seen communities that accomplished the same process in just a single day. Typically, the latter communities have a stronger history of community building, with many people having previously met in person, whether through choirs, gardening, or sports like table tennis. This allowed them to establish trust very quickly. As for when disputes arise between residents, I tend to see them as an extension of the logic behind property rights. Similar disputes are common in homeowner groups. The owners are led by a logic of protecting their personal property, and conflicts of interest inevitably arise whenever private property is involved, resulting in factional conflicts among owners. During the outbreak, some residents advocated strict lockdowns of any buildings in their neighborhood where positive cases were found. In the process, they simplified public problems into private problems and sought to realize their private interests through segregation. If residents had more experience in community engagement, we would see greater community trust, rather than a logic ruled by property rights that insulates individuals from one another. Sixth Tone: What other factors have contributed to the resilience of communities during the lockdown? Sun: Women have played a very important role in community organization. One obvious example has been “group-buying coordinators,” or tuanzhang, most of whom are women. They quickly set up supply chains for their communities after the lockdown, organizing the purchase, delivery, and distribution of food faster than the authorities. The rise of tuanzhang is closely tied to the more active role of women in their communities. If a community only has one WeChat group, it’s likely to be for mothers, since parenting has a strong communal aspect: You need to know about the community’s security situation, be familiar with the nearby supermarkets, and keep up to date on issues like food safety. Empirically speaking, groups of young mothers are common in urban communities. Mothers also tend to play a more direct role in the care of the elderly and better understand the needs of older people. I’m not talking here about cultural stereotypes. Motherhood-based social networks have played a crucial role in binding community members together. Because of the traditional gender division of labor, men are often absent at the family level, which makes them much less able to participate in community affairs.  Sixth Tone: There have been a lot of complaints directed toward neighborhood committees on social media, including for not sending enough food and not responding to residents’ demands in a timely manner. How should we view the different competencies of neighborhood committees and grassroots resident organizations? Sun: Neighborhood committees are a particularly tricky topic. Located between residents and the government, they are an important link for residents connecting their home lives, community lives, and society at large. However, I’ve noticed that many residents don’t particularly understand neighborhood committees. Misled by consumer-based thinking, they tend to conflate neighborhood committees with private property management companies and are accustomed to filing complaints in order to solve the problem of inadequate “services.” Legally speaking, neighborhood committees are “resident self-governance organizations” — not government offices. Their members should theoretically be residents elected by residents. When we complain about neighborhood committees, we should ask ourselves one question: Have I ever voted in the neighborhood committee elections? I’ve spent 15 years researching Shanghai’s neighborhood committees, and I’ve consistently found that young people show little interest in the elections and day-to-day activities of these bodies. They don’t think of themselves as residents of a community, even after extensive mobilization. What we need is to put community autonomy into practice through more widespread participation and turn neighborhood committees into a means of expressing the community’s interests. Sixth Tone: On the other hand, we could also view the rising number of complaints as a sign of growing interest in community governance.  Sun: That’s right. During the initial flurry of group-buying, many residents of upscale residential compounds competed on social media by posting pictures of Western food and afternoon tea that their communities had procured. It was a way to display their social status. As the lockdown stretched on, however, it had the opposite effect: flaunting high-end consumption amid material shortages only served to highlight inequality and undermine the social prestige of these communities, and even the wealthy have been unable to buy their way out of food shortages. A community’s ability to procure food seems to come down to the ability of the relevant district governments, subdistrict offices, and neighborhood committees to allocate resources. I look at this as a lesson about the importance of supportive neighborhoods, well-run neighborhood committees, effective governance, and transparent information distribution systems. In order to achieve these, individuals need to think of themselves not just as “consumers,” but also as active participants in public affairs. Nearly two weeks after Shanghai entered lockdown, people began sharing an online “Community Red/Black List” document on social media, with residents flocking to edit its content to express either their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their subdistricts, neighborhood committees, and property management company’s handling of the outbreak, as well as the delivery of supplies. Given how comprehensive the survey is, and how enthusiastically people are participating in the survey as a public space, it signals a potentially profound change: one in which more people develop a sense of citizenship and participate in the governance of their society.

"Low on Fresh Supplies, Shanghai Residents Turn to Indoor Gardening",City dwellers are getting their hands dirty amid difficulties in ensuring fresh produce.,2022-04-20,"Vegetables have become prized possessions in locked-down Shanghai, and many residents are now determined to grow their own. Many Shanghai residents have started to plant produce in their kitchens or balconies in an attempt to achieve a degree of food self-sufficiency. Supply chain disruptions and limited delivery services amid an ongoing lockdown to contain the surge of COVID-19 have led to the city’s 25 million people scrambling to secure daily supplies over the past weeks. Han Bale, an accountant from the Pudong New Area, has been trapped inside her apartment since mid-March as part of the city’s targeted lockdowns before the citywide shutdown. When the 27-year-old saw the garlic in her kitchen sprouting, she thought of planting it in a plastic bottle using water and the nutrients she already had to help it grow. “It was like magic,” Han told Sixth Tone, referring to the progress. She has since planted other vegetables — including scallion, bean sprout, and lettuce — in her kitchen from scraps. Han reaped her first scallion harvest a week later and used her homegrown produce in a meat dish. “A small ingredient could make the difference in the whole eating experience,” Han said. Sales of vegetable seeds grew on e-commerce platform Taobao in the first quarter of 2022, while smart planters powered by vertical farming technologies saw a two-fold increase compared with the same period last year, according to domestic outlet Jiemian. Most of the orders came from big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Several online seed and smart planter merchants told Sixth Tone their businesses were “in good shape” this year. A seed wholesaler said tomato, lettuce, and cucumber seeds were among its best-selling products. Vegetable gardening isn’t a new idea in Shanghai, though a lack of space and urbanization have limited its scope. To encourage urban farming and add greenery to the city’s landscape, some companies have also initiated rooftop gardening in the past few years. But some residents are only starting to adopt the idea as daily supplies dwindle amid a prolonged lockdown. A Shanghai resident, surnamed Yang, told Sixth Tone he has been experimenting with indoor gardening with some ups and downs. “The most fascinating part is to see those little changes on your plants day by day, as you feel the power of life and hope in that tiny existence,” said the 31-year-old advertising specialist, adding that watching online tutorials on the topic also serves as one of his pastimes. Chadwick Wang, an associate professor at Tsinghua University focusing on the sociology of science and technology, said taking up home farming amid the pandemic gives people a sense of control amid growing uncertainties, even if it’s not their main source of daily supplies. He added that while the pandemic may not boost the vertical farming industry, it could open new opportunities as more people have now shown interest. “Growing vegetables on balconies cannot fill one’s stomach entirely,” he told Sixth Tone, adding that it takes time and effort to achieve significant results. “The act of growing seems to be more important than actually eating them.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010138
The Tech Support Next Door,"When their elderly neighbors struggled for supplies amid the Shanghai lockdown, one young couple stepped up. Soon, many followed.",2022-04-19,"Wang Ye, from China’s eastern Shandong province, and his girlfriend, who is from Shanghai, rent an apartment in an old colony not far from the Huangpu River in Shanghai’s Pudong area. Both are introverted, in their mid-20s, and working professionals. Across their apartment, the young and elderly hardly interact, and the one time the couple requested help from an elderly neighbor, things didn’t go as planned. But on March 22, all that changed. That day, the community was locked down in the aftermath of the recent COVID-19 surge across the city. In the pandemonium that followed, most elderly residents struggled to participate in their apartment’s efforts to buy food and supplies through WeChat, China’s social super-app. Concerned, Wang Ye and his girlfriend put up a notice on their building’s main door offering help. In no time, the couple assisted eight elderly households in their building. When more and more aged residents began seeking help, other young people in the community volunteered to lend a hand. On April 9, Wang, in a WeChat post, detailed his thoughts and methods to help elderly neighbors. The post not only gained instant traction online but also spurred several others into action, including one friend who said he’d also helped an old man in his community buy much-needed blood pressure medicine. The following is Wang Ye’s story, as told to reporter Li Jianan.  Need vegetables, not refunds There are more than 30 buildings in the community where my girlfriend and I rent an apartment, and each building comprises around 25 households. Like lots of similar, older neighborhoods in Shanghai, announcements are mostly made via megaphones and public notices. Between 4 and 5 p.m. on March 22, we were just getting ready for a round of shopping when we realized the gate to the community had been cordoned off. An announcement over megaphone soon followed: we were locked down. At first, they said it would last two days, but that was extended for two more days, and then another two. Now, it’s been almost a month under lockdown. Initially, we managed to order takeaway and also bought groceries from online platforms. But then all of Pudong was locked down, deliveries were suspended on March 28, and ordering groceries online became difficult. That’s when the community finally created a WeChat group that offered group buying — the preferred model of buying groceries in post-lockdown Shanghai, where communities band together and place bulk orders directly with food companies. A lady we once met while feeding the apartment’s stray cats added my girlfriend to the group. I was reluctant to join at first since I felt the elderly in Shanghai were not very welcoming to outsiders. But the system was complicated — there were just too many messages in the group for one person to handle. When my girlfriend couldn’t keep up with them all, I finally joined too. Between March 22 and April 2, the neighborhood committee sent us barely anything; it only organized two bulk purchases of vegetables. The first was a 30-yuan ($4.7) box of assorted vegetables, but we missed the message. We managed to sign up the second time, but when it finally arrived, the price had gone up from 30 yuan to 50 yuan.  Over two days starting April 3, we received four packages from the committee containing the most basic necessities — rice, flour, oil and salt, a carton of milk, a pack of luncheon meat, some sausages, and cucumbers. Later, we also got two packs of Lianhua Qingwen Granules, a Chinese medicine used as a treatment for COVID-19. Without the group buying, we would have struggled to get other necessary supplies. One day, my girlfriend suddenly began wondering about the older people in our apartment. She counted that at least around a dozen of the 200-plus members in the group buying chat were possibly senior citizens.  The signs were clear: they had profile pictures only older people used: some had likely only recently registered on WeChat and didn’t have a profile picture; others had bland status messages like “happy every day.” Some seniors put their names down in the chat — a process termed jielong — to participate in the group buying, but failed to pay and ended up getting nothing. Others posted messages complaining about price increases and demanded refunds. In such situations, tuanzhang, or “neighborhood group-buying coordinators,” replied tersely with: “If you can’t use a cellphone, don’t take part.” My girlfriend once noticed an old person mention in the group chat that when they asked the neighborhood committee for food, he was given two bamboo shoots. On another occasion, the head of the group ordered 128-yuan vegetable blind boxes, which were not delivered due to the lockdown, and so everyone was given a refund. One old man in the group said bluntly, “We want vegetables, not refunds.” After being bombarded with so much news about the pandemic, I started to feel depressed, as did my girlfriend, who often started crying after watching the news. Unwilling to remain mute bystanders, we came up with the idea of helping the senior citizens. On April 4, we wrote the note offering our services and stuck it on the main building door.  Stock sharing When nucleic acid tests are conducted, the building’s pointsperson knocks on each door to notify all residents. It’s why I presumed they must also know of the difficulties the elderly in the building face. Our little endeavor was just to help pick up the slack. But soon after posting the note on the main door, we were surprised when eight elderly households in the building contacted us. The first was the very next morning. I was collecting group-ordered groceries when an old man asked me where I got them from. On discovering that he lived in the same building, I pointed to the notice I’d put up and said I would be glad to help him. The man was quite nearsighted and couldn’t read the notice. So he just went home and then sent his wife to take a look at the note. Neither of them could use a cellphone and hadn’t eaten meat in several days. They asked for meat and mantou, or “steamed buns,” items that I’d recently bought and so gave to the elderly couple. They thanked me profusely. The old man then paid me for the supplies in cash. My girlfriend is from Shanghai, and she told me that for older people here, “steamed buns” actually meant filled buns. Later, when I went to deliver food to them again, an elderly lady next door poked her head out to speak to me. That’s when I realized another aged couple in the same building faced the same problem: they couldn’t use a cellphone well either. One elderly neighbor came straight up and knocked on the door after seeing our note. I saw she had a phone, so I added her to the group buying chat. But since she was not very familiar with using it, we basically ended up doing it for her. Of the eight elderly households we helped, maybe only one person managed to complete a purchase on their own, which, in the end, wasn’t necessarily successful. Their basic needs were filled buns, milk, meat, and eggs. Sometimes while delivering supplies, several seniors came out of their apartments to speak to me, almost like children waiting to be fed. On April 8, I bought a large tray of eggs, and seniors from three apartments all rushed out, so I divided the eggs, giving 10 to each family. Though many have lived here for more than 20 years, they were not familiar enough with each other, and so did not know others were in the same boat.  It’s extremely stressful both working from home and having to keep an eye out for group buying messages. On the busiest day, I started work early in the morning and also ordered the meat and vegetables we needed from one of the groups. Another group had contacted an import supermarket selling coffee beans, and since my girlfriend likes coffee, I placed an order. I also saw a message that milk was available, so I asked my neighbors if they needed any and then placed an order for everyone. The biggest community chat group bought eggs, so when several old people I recently met said they wanted some, I tried to place an order, succeeding only on the second attempt. One group was selling packs of chicken legs and shrimp. Since someone there didn’t want them anymore, I asked the residents of another building to share the order. I had a nucleic acid test at 10 p.m. that day and then an online work meeting for another hour. I went downstairs to pick up the orders that had arrived and finally called it a night. I was really struggling to keep up, so on April 8, suggested that other young people in our building buddy up with our elderly neighbors, each taking care of two to three households. Everyone was very positive, and we soon put the plan into action. Over the next few days, the seniors gradually built up a bank of supplies, with one even mentioning that he’d like some apples and pears. I purchased a 120-yuan fruit basket via group buy, deducted the cost of the other fruits, and charged him just for the apples and pears. Among the senior citizens, except for one who uses Alipay, the others all ended up using cash. By April 9, I had probably collected around 300 or 400 yuan in cash. Also, since many don’t speak Mandarin well and I understand little Shanghainese, I relied on my girlfriend to either translate or speak with them directly. However, now that I’ve heard so much, I’ve managed to pick up on some of the patterns.  “The kid who cries gets the candy” I moved to this community from Beijing late last year. Because I’m quite introverted, I rarely communicated with the older people in the building. When I first arrived, I had to ask a neighbor for help, but the experience wasn’t very pleasant. My TV had arrived from Beijing in a wooden crate. Needing a hammer to open it, I gathered the courage to knock on my neighbor’s door. The man wasn’t very pleased and told me to ring the doorbell rather than knock, before reluctantly lending me a hammer. Some months later, there was a loud knock at our door at midnight. We were so scared that we opened it with scissors in hand. Standing there was the same neighbor, who told us we were required to get a nucleic acid test. Until a few days ago, we were always on our guard against each other. When my girlfriend went downstairs to pick up the milk we’d ordered, she bumped into the same elderly man looking through the things we’d bought. He asked her for some help buying a couple of bottles of milk. I told him the price, and possibly because he suspected we were cheating him, he asked for just a single bottle instead. Trust had to be gradually established during this lockdown, a little bit with each group purchase and door-step delivery.  I believe I now have a better understanding of the old saying, “The kid who cries gets the candy.” A lot of older people will not ask for help until they’re actually starving. As long as they have something to eat, they are reluctant to let on their distress to their children. Most seniors in our building are couples. These past couple of days, I found out about an older woman living alone whose daughter lives elsewhere and was struggling to take care of both her mother and her own family. So, the younger people in our group did the shopping for the woman, and the daughter just paid for the food. Now, the residents are helping each other through the group chats. There was a positive case in one of the community’s buildings — a couple in their 80s, one of whom had a fever and the other a bad cough. Their niece then asked for help buying medicine in a group. Finally, a resident in a neighboring community managed to throw some over the main gate, and a volunteer delivered it to them. I also read in one group about someone who said they had been using A4 sheets of paper instead of toilet paper for several days, that it was too rough, and they couldn’t manage anymore, so someone delivered some toilet paper to him. The first time I delivered food to a neighbor, I was surprised that he thanked me over and over again and called me a “lifesaver.” Even now, he still stops to express his gratitude. For example, the second time I brought him bread, he said, “That beef you brought me the first time was delicious.” On my third visit, when I delivered some fruit, he said, “The bread you brought me last time was great.” I could sense that he was trying to bond, and he said I should let him know if I needed any help in the future. Actually, it made me feel pretty bad. For young people like us, it’s really the least we can do. Neighborhood watch My girlfriend and I also want to thank the other residents. If not for the lady we met while feeding the stray cats, we’d never have joined the WeChat group, and we’d be the ones starving today. The young people in the building are now more connected than before. The community is friendlier and is no longer just a place where we clock off to go to sleep.  We say hello to each other, collect deliveries together, and chat. One woman in the building had stocked up on a lot of food and offered to share it, giving us a pack of ham for sandwiches. Later, when we spotted in another group that she wanted cake, we gave her one we had. Another time, she said she wanted to eat glutinous rice balls filled with sesame paste, so my girlfriend took her some. She then gave us some mandarin oranges and invited us to visit her home for a meal when the situation improved. One resident who lives on our floor managed to buy a whole heap of vegetables and gave us a big bag of celery, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes. We thought it was too expensive and more than we could eat, so we just kept the tomatoes and gave him a few leafy greens in return. At first, he didn’t want anything in return, but when he saw the greens he relented. On April 9, one of the group-purchased vegetable packs included celery. Though my girlfriend and I don’t particularly like celery, I ordered two packs so we would have something to trade if anyone in the building needed it.  My hometown is Changdao in the eastern Shandong province. In our community there, residents often visit each other. Though I’m introverted, I understand the importance of good neighborly relations. To me, neighbors are really important, second only to relatives. On Lunar New Year’s Day back home, we don’t only visit our relatives, but also our current and past neighbors. On April 10, another batch of vegetables I ordered arrived, and I distributed it among two elderly households. Unexpectedly, the 30-yuan vegetable boxes from the neighborhood committee group buying also showed up.  I thought that the elderly residents were unlikely to be able to finish so much in such a short time. To be honest, I hope that the subdistrict and neighborhood committee can do things a bit better. I remember reading somewhere that Shanghai’s problems could be solved by letting the advertising industry design the nucleic acid testing process and putting community managers from tech companies in charge of the group buying. However, I think this raises the bar for ordinary people looking to do a little good. Personally, I’m really pleased with what we ordinary folk have managed to achieve. In such precarious situations, if everyone could just take the time to check in on their neighbors, that’s already a step in the right direction. Wang Ye is a pseudonym.

What it Takes to Organize a Group Buy in Locked Down Shanghai,"All you need is to stay online 24 hours a day, be ready for a barrage of messages anytime, and sometimes unload 45 kilograms of strawberries all alone at 2 a.m",2022-04-19,"Check out this brand-new job opportunity in locked-down Shanghai: group buy organizer. It requires you to stay online 24 hours a day, be ready for a barrage of messages anytime, and sometimes unload 45 kilograms of strawberries all alone at 2 a.m. Most importantly, the job offers absolutely no income. Under full-scale lockdown for more than two weeks, Shanghai, a city of over 25 million people, is facing its worst food crisis in decades. Stores, supermarkets, and grocers are closed. People are forced to stay at home. Online grocery shopping apps can only satisfy a small percentage of people due to the lack of delivery drivers. Increasingly desperate residents have banded together to order food wholesale. Sixth Tone interviewed four group buy organizers, trying to figure out who they are, what they do, and how they’ve managed to feed a bunch of hungry and angry people while commercial services went missing in action. They’ve got some things in common. All the organizers we reached were women in their twenties. Cui Lili, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, said in an interview that she estimates that 95% of Shanghai’s group buy organizers are female, based on groups she’s seen. These women all have full-time jobs that have nothing to do with the food industry or supply chain, and all are organizing group buys as volunteers. They don’t earn anything from it, no matter how heavy the workload is. Group buy organizers are busy around the clock. They have to find suppliers, take between dozens and hundreds of orders per day, place orders, and then distribute the goods when they arrive. There are two ways to source food. One is through designated suppliers on lists published by the district governments. The other is through private connections, such as a friend who works for a food company. Designated suppliers are limited to providing essentials, such as vegetables, eggs, meat, or instant meals — no alcohol, tobacco, or junk food. Some organizers exclude fruit. If you want bread, milk, or Coca-Cola (it's practically hard currency in Shanghai nowadays), the only way is to start or join a private group purchase. Sometimes companies release contact information for group purchases in their own app or on social media. Those lines can get jammed, organizers said, and as soon as they can be connected, the supplies have often already been snapped up.  Things can also be different depending on what kind of housing you live in. Most of Shanghai’s housing stock fits in three kinds: traditional lane houses, large apartment complexes, and apartments in mixed-use commercial buildings.  In older lane houses, the population density is relatively low and the boundaries between communities are often blurred. This can make it difficult to get enough people together to complete a group buy with a larger minimum order, such as a vegetable box that starts at 100 orders. It can also complicate deliveries. In an old neighborhood, a group can cover a whole block, meaning the organizer needs to hire a helper who’s not locked down to carry goods between different compounds. The cost can be huge. In one case on April 11, a delivery person charged 600 yuan ($94) to help bring a group purchase of fruit to 19 houses. It worked out to 80 yuan per household for a box of fruit, and 30 yuan for delivery. At apartment compounds, things are easier. A single building or compound can form a group, and the building management office can help with deliveries. For apartments in office buildings, some neighborhood councils refused to distribute supplies to them at the beginning of this outbreak because they’re technically located in commercial areas. Group buys became their only way to get food. But since they have much fewer people than in commercial residential buildings, those who live in mixed-use buildings often can’t meet the minimum purchase amount. Organizers said they wound up ordering more than they could use just to meet a minimum order of 50 packages of food. When it comes to the obstacles in group buying, everyone has something to say.  The most painful thing is an unreliable supplier. Long Wuwu, a 25-year-old who works in the art industry, told Sixth Tone that wholesalers don’t always come when they promise. In the beginning, she had no intention of becoming a group buy organizer. But after another organizer was unable to collect money for order, she was put in this position as the second person on the group members’ list. She didn’t take time off from work — in fact, when Sixth Tone contacted her, she was able to speak only at 9 p.m. She gave a pseudonym in order to protect her privacy. Long contacted the supplier through information published by the local government. They offered four packages: 3.5 or 7 kilograms of vegetables, a chicken, or 4 kilos of fruit. After hard work gathering 51 orders from her neighborhood, she placed a bulk order on the afternoon of April 8. The supplier promised her that the food would be delivered late at night on April 9. April 10, Long waited until 3 a.m. The food still hadn’t come.  Long began to worry that she’d failed her neighbors. Some had skipped other group buys in order to join hers — so if she didn’t get the food, they could be without supplies for a long time. “You’re responsible for them,” she said. Angry, she contacted the supplier to complain and ask for a refund. After a long time, the supplier finally said that the goods would definitely arrive that night. Long kept waiting that night and finally the van came, at 2 a.m on April 11.  Perishable food has to be delivered right away. Exhausted, Long managed to deliver all the food to each room by 3:30 a.m. with the help of volunteers. She got to sleep at 4 a.m. that night. Arranging one delivery meant four days of constant stress, Long said. “Everything was up in the air.” She needed to constantly contact the supplier to push things forward. And not all the goods were delivered. “When talking to that supplier, he really acted like a robot. I asked when the goods would arrive and if he could come tonight. He just replied: ‘Too many orders, not sure.’ Again and again, only one sentence: ‘Too many orders, not sure.’”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010158
He Was Visiting Shanghai. Then His Health Code Turned Red.,A Shanxi native describes his harrowing journey from homelessness to finding shelter during the citywide lockdown.,2022-04-19,"As Shanghai’s 25 million residents hunkered down for a citywide lockdown on April 1, one visitor found himself wandering in the city’s deserted streets over the following days. The man, surnamed Liu, was visiting Shanghai from nearby Suzhou to see friends when he was deemed a close contact of a COVID-19-positive individual who was staying at the same dormitory. His color-coded health pass turned red just two days after the lockdown, ending prospects to reenter the dormitory in the city’s Baoshan District. A native of northern Shanxi province, Liu was homeless for 10 days. The 29-year-old has since had a temporary job and his health code also returned to green. The following is an account of how the country’s color-coded health app affects people’s lives, as told by Liu, who only gave his surname for privacy concerns. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.  Turning red I arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou to visit friends on March 11. But I decided to extend my stay after Suzhou decided to quarantine those coming from Shanghai for 15 days. It would have meant 500 yuan ($80) a day for hotel quarantine and meals. It was too expensive. So I waited for the situation to get better. Meanwhile, a friend helped me find cheap accommodation and shared a job opportunity to work as a temporary community worker in Yangpu District. I was bored and hoped to make some money. On March 31, more than 50 of us boarded a bus headed for the residential community where we would work. I packed a sleeping bag along with bread, eight cans of rice porridge, and a big bottle of water. We did a rapid antigen test before the bus hit the road. One of us tested positive. We felt uneasy inside the bus and many of us asked to leave. But the recruiters said no. Someone called the police, but it didn’t help. We got tested twice more, and all of us showed negative results. Relieved, we spent the night in the bus. All of us took another antigen test and a nucleic acid test the following day so we could start working. But it turned out the residential compound only wanted a dozen people. I was cut off when they started counting. Those left out argued with the recruiters, and we were eventually promised 400 yuan compensation for the two days of our time. I wanted to return to the place I was staying, in Baoshan. But all of Shanghai was already locked down, and transportation was restricted. So I got off the bus with some others in Hongkou District. At the time, we heard that the lockdown would end in a few days, so I was hoping to return to my accommodation after public transportation resumed.  Meanwhile, we tried to find hotels but failed. We were told we needed an official permit showing we could move around during the lockdown. We spent the next two nights on the stairway of a fire escape outside a shopping mall. The floor was so cold that I couldn’t sleep. On April 3, my roommates from the dormitory said in our group chat that their health code had turned red. I opened my app immediately. It was red, too. One of the roommates had tested positive over a week ago and was asymptomatic. I guess that’s why our codes turned red. I wasn’t scared of catching the virus, but a red code means you’re restricted from going anywhere. I read online that it generally takes 21 to 27 days for the code to turn green again. Access denied I can’t even remember how many times I was questioned on the road. Whenever I shared my story with the police, they told me to do a nucleic acid test. I went to two nearby hospitals but was denied entry because of my red code. I then started cycling to Baoshan on a shared bike, but was stopped at a checkpoint on the way. I made a U-turn to Hongkou. I was stressed. I rested on a chair in front of a shuttered restaurant there. A security guard soon asked me to leave. I ignored him. He started yelling, saying I wasn’t cooperating with the epidemic prevention rules. He called the police. They questioned me and suggested that I go back to Baoshan. They told me to call 110 (the police hotline) if I was stopped. So I left. A police car followed me until I crossed into Hongkou. When I arrived at a checkpoint in the afternoon, I called 110. The police saw my red code and held me immediately. They started making phone calls. Dressed in protective outfits, they took me to a nearby park and cordoned me off. I gathered an audience — delivery workers, people from nearby households. Some even took photos.  Homeless I have bronchitis and was coughing badly at the park. The police offciers might have thought I was infected. I sat near a flower bed and waited. I didn’t eat breakfast or lunch. The police officers gave me some porridge, chocolate, bread, and cookies, and eventually an antigen test. I tested negative. They took a picture of the result, and I was let go after almost three hours. It was dark when I started cycling again. It was past 10 p.m. when I finally reached where I lived. But the security guard wouldn’t let me in. I had no choice but to find a place nearby to sleep. I biked to a mall and slept on the corner of the first floor. My roommate had passed me a tent from inside the dormitory compound, so I slept against the wall. It was slightly warmer.  I regretted coming to Shanghai, and I regretted not returning to Suzhou soon enough. I called 110 repeatedly and they referred me to 12345 (the city services hotline), which was very hard to get through. I also called the medical assistance hotline. They told me to call the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was even more difficult to get through. During those days, I only got through to 12345 once. They said they would handle the situation. I received a text message saying that my case had been reported. There was no follow up. Helping hands I messaged a WeChat group with many people seeking help, and was approached by some volunteers. They posted my plea on Weibo on April 5 along with my phone number, and the volunteers also added me to a rescue group on WeChat. I then realized there were many others needing help: Those requiring medicine, others with sick family members, children lacking milk powder, and COVID-19-positive patients waiting for central quarantine. A woman near the dormitory told me to pick up some supplies. She gave me two packets of instant noodles, hot water, fruit, and cookies. I was so hungry that I ate both packets at once. Instant noodles never tasted so good. An older man also asked people who lived in the area to cook for me. Then I ate steamed buns, tomatoes with fried eggs, and bacon. They were the only meals I had besides bread and porridge during those days. I had to calculate my rations and eat economically. I was constantly hungry and could barely ride the bike.  On April 9, a woman told me that there was a hospital that could give me a nucleic acid test without checking my health code, so I headed over there. But on my way, a police officer stopped me, and again I told my story. Then I opened my health app — and my code was downgraded to yellow. The officer suggested a place to stay. I checked the location online and found it was a warehouse. It also seemed like a disposal site, and it was a hot day. So when the police left, I continued to the hospital. They didn’t check my health code, and I finally got a nucleic acid test. That night, I moved from the shopping mall to the entrance of a subway station. I saw other people sleeping there, and it felt better to have company. One of the men there was over 40. He had been a construction worker at a quarantine center. Like myself, he wasn’t allowed to go back to the place he was staying. But he had no sleeping bag. He just wrapped a quilt around himself and slept in the corner between a car and the wall to avoid the wind. The two other people also only had a quilt. It was from them that I finally found out where to buy food and water. I felt somewhat relieved. Ray of hope When I was resting near the subway station the next day, a man told me about a job opportunity nearby, suggesting I go check. He was also applying for the job. The four of us sleeping by the subway station went to inquire, but only I managed to get through. The others didn’t have a nucleic acid test result. I had heard they were hiring security guards for a government job, but it turned out we’d be helping carry food supplies to a nearby residential compound. The job provided food and accommodation. I was finally able to sleep on a bed, with a quilt. It felt so comfortable. I woke up every day at 6 a.m. and finished work around 7 p.m. I was responsible for receiving daily supplies for the residents. It was exhausting, and it paid 200 yuan per day.  In Suzhou, I deliver goods for supermarkets, but it wasn’t as exhausting. I went to sleep immediately after work. Sometimes, we also worked as dabai (“big whites,” or workers in protective clothing) to maintain order during the nucleic acid tests in the compound. That was easier. The place where I worked is an apartment complex with tens of thousands of residents. I had heard hundreds of people there were infected but were yet to be transferred to central quarantine. So I was stressed and a little scared. On April 11, my health code finally turned green, exactly a month after I arrived in Shanghai. The code turned red, yellow, and then green in just a few days. It was exhilarating. On April 17, I left the job after some of my coworkers tested positive for COVID-19. I’m now sharing a hotel room with two other colleagues. The hotel owner was nice enough to allow us in. I haven’t told my parents about my experience. I don’t want them to worry. I’ll probably just bury this whole saga in my heart. I wouldn’t go back to where I stayed in Baoshan now, because my roommates are all infected. I have gone through a lot in life. I think I’ve faced harder times before — my relationship issues were much tougher.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010162
The Out of Towners Helping to Test Shanghai,"Every day, medical workers come into the locked-down city to give COVID-19 tests. Required to keep their suits on all day, that means hungry afternoons and adult diapers for many.",2022-04-19,"SHANGHAI – It’s the end of another long day for Jin Yingxiong. At 9 p.m. April 9, he’s on a bus heading for a hotel in Jiaxing, about 100 kilometers from urban Shanghai in Zhejiang province. Jin is one of a team of 40 medical workers who have been helping the megacity conduct COVID-19 tests. Most of his colleagues are sound asleep. As Shanghai battles its worst ever coronavirus outbreak, around 38,000 medical workers from around the country have arrived to help, working either in quarantine centers or roaming testing teams. The city is building more quarantine centers to cope with surging infections and citywide nucleic acid tests continue, and more workers like them are coming. It’s Jin’s first time doing any kind of medical tests. He’s a pharmacist in a hospital in Zhejiang, where he’s worked for nearly a decade. Jin misses his 4-year-old child and wife and video called them on days when he didn’t have assignments. “They’re all worried about me. I’ve been away from home for nearly a month now,” Jin, who insisted on using a pseudonym for privacy concerns, told Sixth Tone. The 31-year-old was summoned to Jiaxing on March 14, when a wave of COVID-19 infections in Shanghai started to spread to neighboring cities. Although the prefecture of 5.5 million had recorded just eight cases over two days, it went on high alert and began district-wide tests immediately. Zhejiang has responded to COVID-19 very cautiously since 2020. Jin’s hometown, a smaller city, went into full lockdown on March 14, when local authorities detected 10 COVID-19 cases. “The citywide lockdown was announced shortly after the finding, and the situation was soon under control,” Jin recalled. The lockdown was lifted a week later. “I personally prefer stricter controls at the very beginning.” Jiaxing was a manageable challenge, Jin said. “We didn’t enter the locked-down areas. We received adequate training, and the workload was acceptable.”  In Zhejiang, Jin had help from dozens of young community workers and volunteers. “Most are in their early 30s like me. They’re quick in learning and reactions,” Jin said. When Jin’s team finished their work, they were asked to stay put. They would use Jiaxing as a base for trips to neighboring Shanghai.  The megacity started its two-phase citywide lockdown on March 28, originally intended to last four days on each side of the river. But the lockdowns, and near-daily rounds of testing, continue as Shanghai reports tens of thousands of new infections every single day. Since April 7, Jin has traveled to Shanghai six times to conduct nucleic acid tests. “I had been closely following developments in Shanghai, and I was worried about my own health,” he said. Since Shanghai is struggling to find space to quarantine its infected residents and their close contacts, medical workers who come from Zhejiang all return to hotels in the province after finishing the work. Each time, Jin and his teammates spent more than 10 hours traveling and working. Despite the long hours, they were ordered by the provincial health authority not to drink, eat, or use the toilet throughout the day. “It’s the best way to protect us from infection,” Jin told Sixth Tone. “Even if it weren’t compulsory, none of us wants to take the risk. We’d rather stay hungry and thirsty for the day.”  Many of his co-workers put on adult diapers before setting out for the mission. Jin chose not to, as he found it uncomfortable. “I didn’t eat or drink a lot in the morning. I was confident I wouldn’t need to use the toilet.” On his first trip on April 7, Jin was sent to an old apartment compound in Changning District, one of the least affected areas in Shanghai. To his surprise, the compound, home to 800-plus people, had only five volunteers organizing the tests. “In Zhejiang, there are many more volunteers, who are young and energetic. The volunteers and community workers, who received us in Shanghai, are mostly in their 50s. They looked tired,” he recalled. A major source of trouble was QR codes. Before testing, residents needed to load an ID code on their phones. The phoneless could register with ID cards, but it was a complicated process.  “I asked them why they didn’t look for more volunteers. They said they didn’t dare to because they couldn’t provide more hazmat suits and would worry about their health.”  Volunteers in Shanghai compounds are not only responsible for organizing residents for nucleic acid tests, but also for bringing residents daily supplies and antigen test kits. “The job is very physically demanding. I can understand why they’re so exhausted,” Jin said. Across Shanghai, volunteers and neighborhood committees are facing an enormous challenge. In Shanghai, local issues are handled by neighborhood committees. A typical neighborhood committee has only a handful of staff, and in a compound in which thousands of people live, must take care of everything from garbage sorting, parking space arrangement, looking after seniors, and addressing conflicts. They do have helpers: each building usually has a designated representative, typically a retiree who enjoys helping others and socializing. Earlier this month, a neighborhood committee Party secretary burst into tears when reached by a resident, inquiring why her COVID-19-positive neighbors were not transferred in time. Another grassroots official in the Pudong New Area wrote an open letter to the 4,000-plus residents living in the compound, detailing how helpless he has been in this crisis. “I have been living in the neighborhood committee office since March 11. Every night I slept for two or three hours,” wrote the Party secretary, surnamed Wu.  In the compound where he works, dozens of positive cases have been reported since March. “I failed to reply to residents’ questions because I don’t have the answers. As a grassroots official, I don’t have access to firsthand or essential information. My superiors told me my priority is to calm down the residents,” he wrote. When Sixth Tone called Wu’s office last week, the official was busy coordinating with police officers. “The secretary didn’t stop working after publicizing the letter,” an officer from the neighborhood committee told Sixth Tone. “Many residents called the police to demand the immediate transfer of their COVID-positive neighbors. We could do nothing if the disease control authority didn’t make the arrangements.”  On their first assignment to Shanghai, Jin and his co-workers were sent to dozens of different compounds and had very different experiences. Some said they were moved by grateful residents, who kept saying thank you, while other medical workers complained of an insufficient supply of essential materials like medical gloves. Despite the challenges, they managed to test on average 400 residents each that day. On April 9, Jin arrived for the second time around noon for another round of citywide nucleic acid tests. Because hazmat suits are only effective for about six hours, the provincial health authority set a deadline: All Zhejiang medical teams should leave the test sites before 6 p.m. Jin finished testing 460 residents at 5:45 p.m. on the day and returned to the bus. “The tests went much smoother than the first time I worked here,” he said. Shanghai updated its nucleic test system on that day, creating a single QR code that stays valid for a month, and streamlining offline registration. Previously residents had to register online each time before a nucleic acid test.  The new system also made things easier for the medical workers. Previously, they had to paste a sticker with a QR code onto each test tube on site. Now, the stickers have already been prepared on the tubes for them. “This procedure saves us time and also ensures the stickers won’t easily fall off the tubes. When medical workers pasted them on site, we’d sometimes lose the stickers,” Jin said. “That meant some people didn’t get their test results.”  At 10:30 p.m., 14 hours after breakfast, Jin finally got his second meal of the day after a thorough disinfection at the Jiaxing hotel. Jin had lost five kilograms in the past month. In addition to the strict no food or water requirement during their work, the medical team receives a nucleic test every day. “This, to a maximum degree, guarantees our health.” Given all the protective measures, once they finish their tasks, the medical workers will only be required to quarantine in a hotel for seven days before they can return home. So far, none of his teammates have been infected, Jin said. It’s his sixth trip to Shanghai for the tests on Tuesday. Dressed in hazmat suit, Jin rode a bicycle on an almost empty street, heading for the neighborhood he’s going to help test. He filmed the scenes on the street: a truck is parked by the road, a few delivery men rushing by on scooters. “I’m hoping to see the turning point in Shanghai soon,” Jin said. “The day will come. It’s only a matter of time. I just hope it can arrive earlier.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010160
"In Locked-Down Shanghai, Neighbors Band Together to Ease Crisis","From buying groceries in bulk for the entire building to sharing virus-related updates, many are forming new bonds with former strangers.",2022-04-19,"As Shanghai grapples with COVID-19, the city’s 25 million residents are cooped up indoors. But that hasn’t stopped them from getting to know their neighbors. In a metropolis where people rarely get to know their neighbors, residents are now finding time to familiarize themselves with their surroundings and people who live there. From collective purchases of daily essentials to sharing news updates, citydwellers have formed an unlikely communal affinity. “The lockdown has given me the chance to get to know my neighbors,” one resident who identified herself as Freya told Sixth Tone. “Many of the families have lived here for generations. I was planning to move out from this apartment before, but now I feel there’s a bond here.” Freya relocated to Shanghai after studying abroad and now lives in the city’s former French Concession area. The building where she lives is mostly home to the city’s natives and young tenants, though they previously never mingled. Three weeks into the lockdown, Freya felt that she had emerged out of the “digital cocoon” into the real world. Her connections are not just limited to social media now. Stories of neighborly bonds have been widely shared on social media over the past weeks, as they relied on each other for help. As individual deliveries came to a halt, many apartment complexes formed chat groups on messaging app WeChat to buy groceries in bulk directly from wholesalers. With time, many such groups have morphed into more than a shopping outlet for daily necessities. Neighbors share news — with a fair dose of rumors circulating online — and photos of their supplies of occasional government rations. Some share memes to lighten up their otherwise gloomy spirits while others send funny videos and recipes found on short video platform Douyin. Freya joined her community WeChat group where they mostly talk about lockdown updates, COVID-19 test arrangements, and group buying. She said she had spoken to many of her neighbors for the first time though she had lived there for years. “Many residents had to pay high prices to get their coffee delivered after the lockdown started — they were already cold by the time they arrived,” she said. “I have coffee machines at home, so I thought I could take this opportunity to make free coffee for my neighbors.” This type of community mutual aid was relatively amiss in neighborhoods across the city before the current outbreak, according to observers. Jin Jing, co-founder of Big Fish Community Design Center in Shanghai, said busy schedules coupled with such accommodations makes community building difficult. In bigger cities like Shanghai, people usually live in high-rise apartment complexes with thousands of neighbors. “The lockdown has definitely changed Chinese people’s relationships with their neighbors,” said Jin. “Before, people didn’t have many connections with their neighbors, especially for fast-paced cities like Shanghai. They don’t have time for their neighbors.” But now many residents are realizing the importance of building personal connections. A Shanghai resident who only gave her first name Qiuyu said people are even taking to social media to find their neighbors. Qiuyu told Sixth Tone that she has helped over 7,000 people find their neighbors through some three dozen WeChat groups she created since the lockdown started. Along with her friends, she later collected information from various neighborhoods along with their community groups’ QR codes and posted them on a shared document that later went viral. “At first we were just helping friends who don’t know where their neighbors are,” she said. “After a while, more and more people contacted us asking if we also have group chats for their streets.” Qiuyu said she has witnessed hundreds of stories of community mutual help everyday from group buying to helping the elderly. “It feels like I’m going back to the old days, when neighbors all knew each other very well and always helped each other,” she added. However, the neighborhood groups haven’t always remained cordial. Residents have shared their petty squabbles in the chat groups over what’s deemed essential daily supplies — some argued that bottled water and fruits weren’t as essential. Social media posts have shown some people disparaging neighbors after they tested positive for the virus, while revealing their health status online. A Chinese man even appeared to joke about whether he should “eat the Black guy” in the same compound when raising concerns over food shortages. Jin from the Shanghai-based community design center believes disputes and disagreements show another side of the community. “People’s nature and values can be easily seen and tested by the public health crisis,” she said. “But after all, it’s not always bad to have disputes in the community. It can actually help the community become stronger if people discuss it in a rational way.” Meanwhile, many residents like Freya are not just forging good relationships with their neighbors. They are also helping those in need — especially the older residents. Upon realizing a next door older neighbor was not active in the group chat, she visited him. He was the same man who previously entered her yard without permission and collected her discarded cardboard boxes. Freya had initially thought he “lacked a sense of boundary” but came to trust him over the months that followed. “For the first time I realized he lived alone after living next door to him for years,” she said. “He doesn’t have wireless broadband and saves on his phone’s data.” Freya said she later handed him nearly all of her meat, vegetables, and eggs. She also applied for rice rations for him from a charity. Days later, the man knocked on her door to hand over two corncobs sealed in a vacuum pack. “He told me ‘This is good stuff, different from normal corn. You must try it,’”she said. “I couldn’t help tearing up after closing the door.” Jin said that the community bonds among neighbors could continue even after the pandemic. Although people are likely to return to their daily routine, they’ve already formed a relationship that could remain in place. “The memory that ‘I have helped you, you have helped me’ is very self-evident and will continue to fester for a long time,” she said. But amid all the goodwill and the heartwarming stories from the crisis, Freya said it was also important to remember how the government handled it. “Relying on mutual aid between neighbors only means that there’s an absence of responsibility from the relevant authorities,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010149
"Unable to Leave Shanghai, Truckers Take Refuge in Their Trucks",,2022-04-18,"SHANGHAI — When truck drivers drove to Shanghai in late March, little did they know that many of them would be unable to return to their home provinces for weeks. Since the COVID-19 lockdown started March 28, truckers from neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces said they have faced several difficulties. Some are struggling with limited consignments from the city, while others find it difficult in obtaining permits to leave Shanghai. Those stuck in Shanghai have turned their trucks into makeshift homes. But they’re running out of food, and their truck batteries are either dying or dead. As Shanghai enters its third week of lockdown, the truck drivers and their vehicles have become immobile — just like the city itself. Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, spoke with two truck drivers about their journey so far.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010153
Some of Shanghai’s COVID Patients Are Recovered But Restless,Residents have complained of multiple problems ranging from accessing transport to being allowed into their apartments once discharged.,2022-04-14,"Shanghai residents recovered from COVID-19 said being discharged from “shelter hospitals” isn’t necessarily an end to their ordeal. Many complained of difficulties ranging from post-recovery quarantine to being accepted by their residential communities despite authorities prohibiting such activities. A resident surnamed Guo from the Pudong New Area told Sixth Tone that she waited for about four days to be transferred from a centralized quarantine facility in Chongming District to her home on Wednesday. Earlier that day, her neighborhood committee said she wasn’t registered on their list of returnees but later approved entry without giving a reason. “Medical staff told us we had met the criteria for being discharged, but had to wait for further notice, again and again … I grew anxious about testing positive again after hearing of a similar case,” Guo said. “Getting infected is actually nothing serious. But the chaos makes me feel exhausted.” Shanghai has converted multiple public venues to shelter hospitals — or fangcang — to house COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms. More than 20,000 recovered patients were released from six shelter hospitals managed by the city government over the past two days, authorities said Thursday. The city continued to see a record daily surge in infections Wednesday, logging over 27,000 cases for that day. Local officials said they were discharging recovered COVID-19 patients in batches for a follow-up self-quarantine at home. But like Guo, people have described the dismay over getting into their apartment complexes and even buying groceries. A social media user shared that she walked 7 kilometers in the rain on Wednesday from a transfer station — where discharged patients are first sent from the shelter hospital — to her apartment. She added the bus that was scheduled to pick her up didn’t arrive. For Guo, she said she was worried about securing food supplies after getting back home, as the city remains in a strict lockdown for a second week. She managed to buy mostly frozen food that could be stored for a long time. According to China’s latest rules, those infected are allowed to be discharged from quarantine facilities or hospitals after they test negative for the virus in two consecutive nucleic acid tests at least 24 hours apart. They are then required to undergo a seven-day self-monitoring period at home. Guo had already tested negative for COVID-19 twice, two days apart, a week after being admitted on April 1. However, she had to spend longer at the quarantine facility due to untimely transfers. “The average length of stay in a fangcang is being gradually cut to about one week,” a local health official said during a separate press conference Wednesday. “An increasing number of people have left fangcang in recent days, requiring the hospitals to coordinate with local communities, and district governments to arrange transfers.” Despite officials pledging a smooth transfer for recovered patients, that hasn’t been the case for some. Gong Xing was infected while on a business trip to Shanghai in March and admitted to a shelter hospital late last month. He told Sixth Tone that he was discharged from the facility Wednesday only to find that he had nowhere to stay. “The lease term for the place I rented had expired,” said the 28-year-old, using a pseudonym for privacy concerns. “Most hotels told me they were either closed to the public or requisitioned by the government. I finally checked into a hotel after searching for six hours. Otherwise, I would have been ready to sleep in a tent for days.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010131
"After Shanghai, Other Cities Brace for Potential Omicron Surge","While Guangzhou is mass testing residents following a few dozen cases, cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have rolled out various restrictions.",2022-04-11,"As a highly transmissible Omicron sub-variant of the coronavirus rapidly spreads in Shanghai, other cities and provinces across China are potentially bracing for surges. The BA.2 sub-variant cluster has caused a record number of cases in the country’s financial hub, with Shanghai recording over 100,000 cases in the past week alone. The same variant also resulted in a spike of infections in the southern city of Shenzhen and the northeastern province of Jilin, leading to mass testing and lockdowns. Now, cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou and provinces including Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu have reported infections fueled by the BA.2 variant. Zhejiang and Jiangsu have already instituted a wide range of restrictions, including shutting down many public venues. In Guangzhou, residents fearing a Shanghai-style lockdown cleaned up supermarket shelves after the city detected 38 cases over the weekend. The southern metropolis immediately moved classes online and partially sealed some residential communities, as it mass tested 18 million residents for the virus. The city has also converted one of the world’s biggest exhibition halls, the Canton Fair Complex, into a “shelter hospital,” bracing for a potential impact. A Guangzhou resident, surnamed Wang, told Sixth Tone that fresh vegetables and meat were already sold out on e-commerce platforms on Saturday. She went to a wet market at 7 a.m. the next day but only found empty shelves. “I think people now are just panicking about potential lockdowns like Shanghai,” said Wang, who lives in the city’s Zengcheng District. The fast spread of Omicron is testing the Chinese government’s ability to control the virus which it has kept at bay through mass testing and lockdowns. However, the central government has reiterated plans to stick with its “zero-COVID” policy. In Shanghai, currently at the center of China’s COVID-19 outbreak, authorities said Monday that the city was planning to ease some of the lockdown restrictions announced on March 28. Officials said residents from some 7,000 residential communities with no positive COVID-19 infections in the past seven days would be allowed out within a certain area. However, it’s unclear when Shanghai will entirely lift the lockdown across the city. On Sunday, the city logged another daily high with over 25,000 infections, the majority of whom were asymptomatic. Local authorities said that 11,000 people had been discharged since infections were first detected in March, while some 160,000 with mild or no symptoms remain quarantined in massive quarantine centers as of Sunday. Officials said the city hadn’t reported any deaths from COVID-19 so far.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010093
"For the Takeout-Hungry, Shanghai’s Lockdown Is a Pressure Cooker","Some didn’t own pots and pans, while others indulged in online orders. Now they’re either learning to cook or just struggling.",2022-04-11,"As Shanghai extends its COVID-19 lockdown, millions of residents have turned to self-organized “group buying” amid logistical challenges to secure daily necessities. But some of the city’s residents are grappling to make use of their hard-earned groceries — they don’t know how to cook. Those used to the country’s convenient takeaway services and online grocery deliveries are struggling to find ways to keep themselves fed, probably for the first time in their life. Sixth Tone spoke with four Shanghai residents navigating through the food — and also personal — crisis.  Yi Yu (pseudonym), 25, new media editor Our community in Minhang District has been under lockdown since March 8 after an infection was detected. I didn’t know how to cook before. I only used my kitchen to store beverages. I thought I could live off takeaways my entire life. I ate instant noodles for the first 14 days of the lockdown — after that I just felt like throwing up whenever I saw their packaging. I even swapped different types of instant noodles with my neighbor. It’s an unhealthy diet, and I have finally decided to cook. Initially, I couldn’t even recognize the types of various vegetables or how to cook them. I learned from (lifestyle platform) Xiaohongshu and Douyin, and my mother also sends me cooking tutorials every day. I burned frozen dumplings when frying them for the first time but didn’t want them to go to waste. Then I tried to stir fry vegetables but put too much salt in, though I can make sure they’re cooked and I won’t starve to death.  During the lockdown, I need to stock up on some stuff every day to feel secure and also figure out how to cook. You should never feel like you have enough food — we don't know when the lockdown will be lifted. I will leave Shanghai by the end of the year. The city cannot give me a sense of security. I don’t want to suffer similar experiences anymore. After this COVID-19 wave, I will keep improving my cooking skills, stock up on supplies, and plant some vegetables at home. You never know how long you will be confined at home. Someday we might also have to return to bartering.  Sam (pseudonym), 30, government relations worker I was placed under a one-week lockdown in late March before the citywide lockdown. For the first few days, I just ate whatever snacks I had, like yogurt. We were allowed to order takeaways after three days. After the two-phased lockdown was announced, I didn’t bother to get any cooking equipment or have any means to cook anything. I didn’t think it was going to get bad enough for me to need those. So I just picked up a few things at local grocery stores — carrots, cucumbers, yogurt, and bread — and also ordered on JD.com four days before the lockdown started. None of them arrived. In the first few days, I lived off raw vegetables, yogurts, fruit, crackers, and cereal. Three days after the lockdown started (in the other half of Shanghai) on April 1, my landlord got me a small pot and a couple of spatulas. But I still don’t have any cooking oil, spices, condiments, or sauces. Now I cook but it ends up burnt and flavorless. It’s sad. The food doesn’t taste like anything. The only thing that I can use to flavor any of my food is beer and red wine. I know how to cook, but I’ve never cooked for a year and a half in China. I always eat out. For a lot of people, it’s probably the first time in their life that they’ve ever had to worry about not having enough food. Normally, you would worry about the options to choose from. But suddenly, it’s a completely different mindset. It’s always like I have to look for ways to be able to get more food because it could actually run out. People aren’t used to this kind of stress. Being locked up is already stressful, but stress about food worsens that. I’ve been off work for the most part of the lockdown. I’m trying to figure out how to manage this situation better, and not be overly stressed from work as well. I still have a few boxes of cereal, two packets of instant noodles, one cabbage, half a carrot, one cucumber, and some remaining vegetables. They could last for two more days. Now we’re trying to do group buying, but it’s difficult because we only have 15 people in our building. Otherwise, the expectation is probably the neighborhood committee will try to offer something.  Zhang Zhongyun, 24, bank teller I rent a commercial apartment and live alone. I started to work from home on April 1. I don’t have a kitchen here — there’s no stove, so I cook using an electric pot. I bought it and a rice cooker when I moved into the apartment early this year, but didn’t use them until the lockdown. I usually order takeaways or eat at the company canteen. The meals I cook taste very average, and I have limited ingredients. I often eat similar food, such as beef rolls, for several days in a row. I’m not motivated to get out of bed in the morning because I’m already thinking of what I’ll have to eat. During the lockdown, you are always panicking no matter whether you are fully stocked up. Even when you have sufficient food, you’re worried about their expiration date. When you’re running low, you panic about what to eat and how to secure supplies. I have enough food for a week. There are several packs of dumplings, instant noodles, beef rolls, and some vegetables. I bought them all through group purchases. We’ve never received food supplies from the neighborhood committee. They said commercial apartments don’t have a kitchen and they would prioritize only those with property rights. When I lived with two roommates in 2020, cooking was a social activity and we were happy cooking and talking. Now cooking is a necessity. I have to cook or I’ll starve to death. I will not continue cooking after the outbreak is contained. I’m usually tired from work and not in the mood to cook.  Wang Nan (pseudonym), 30, software developer I ate instant noodles every day for the first week of the lockdown since April 1. I’m running out of the 10 packs of noodles in stock, so I’d have to do with the only ingredients left. I have sausages, rice, and some vegetables distributed by the neighborhood community, which could last for about a week. I do find instant noodles delicious. I also take one multivitamin tablet a day as a supplement. I thought the lockdown would be lifted as announced (April 5), so I didn’t prepare much foodwise. I wasn’t concerned about what to eat then. I thought at least I would not starve to death. Now I’m getting worried. I look for ways to buy whatever supplies there are, in case the lockdown keeps extending. The last time I cooked was in 2015 when I worked in Shenzhen and had a larger kitchen. I often cooked one or two times a week then.  Still, cooking is troublesome. I usually rely on takeaways, and only cook when I have to. Time is valuable for me. I often work from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and do overtime to around 9 p.m. once or twice a week. I would rather spend time dealing with problems at work than making meals. The lockdown has reminded me of the importance of stocking up on a few more boxes of instant noodles for emergencies. But for now, I’ll just need to stay alive first.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010094
‘Group-Buying’ Becomes a Lifeline for Hungry Shanghai Residents,"Communities are banding together to place bulk orders directly with food companies, as e-commerce services in the city remain totally overwhelmed.",2022-04-10,"SHANGHAI — In the hours before her building went into lockdown on April 1, Ye Qiwei did the same thing as millions of others in Shanghai: She placed a huge grocery order via a delivery app. The 33-year-old spent nearly 500 yuan ($80) on fruit, vegetables, and meat — far more than she’d need, she assumed, as the government said the lockdown would only last for four days. She was wrong. Over a week later, her stockpile of food had almost run out — and the lockdown continued with no end in sight. Many of her neighbors were in a worse position, Ye says. One 80-year-old in her building said he’d been living solely on plain rice for three days. “I was scared when I heard about it,” she says. Buying more food was almost impossible. Like most of Shanghai’s 25 million residents, Ye and her neighbors are banned from leaving their apartments. The only way to order goods was using online delivery services, but the system was totally overwhelmed.  Ye set her alarm for 6 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. each morning, so she could try to place an order as soon as the services started operating. It rarely worked. To date, she has only succeeded in ordering one carton of milk and six potatoes via the apps, she says. So, like many communities in the city, Ye and her neighbors decided to band together and take matters into their own hands.  Ye, an advertising executive, has taken on a second role: as a neighborhood “group-buying” coordinator. Ye has set up a special chat group on social app WeChat for anyone wishing to buy milk and eggs. Once more than 60 people have signed up, she places a bulk order directly with a food company, which delivers crates full of dairy products to the residential compound by truck. “Group buying” has emerged as a lifeline for millions of people in Shanghai, as the city struggles to cope with a breakdown in delivery services that is causing acute shortages of essential goods. The metropolis is experiencing China’s largest single COVID-19 outbreak since the initial wave of infections that engulfed Wuhan in early 2020. Shanghai authorities confirmed nearly 25,000 new infections on Saturday — 23,937 of which were classified as asymptomatic — as case numbers continue to rise. After initially resisting a full-scale lockdown, local authorities shut down the entire city in two phases starting from March 28. The vast majority of residents are still confined to their homes — or, in some cases, their residential compounds — and are unable to leave even to buy groceries. The tight restrictions mean that online deliveries are the only way for residents to access food and other essentials. The city’s logistics networks, however, have come under enormous strain as a result. Demand for goods is sky-high, yet most stores, restaurants, and grocery markets remain closed. Online delivery services, meanwhile, are struggling to cope with the volume of orders, as thousands of drivers are themselves locked down. The result has been widespread reports of food shortages. Many residents say they spend hours each day trying to place orders via delivery apps — often without success. Public unrest has grown, with reports of lockdown violations in some areas. Local officials have pledged to fast-track measures to free up the supply of goods and allow thousands of delivery staff to return to work. In a press conference on Saturday, Shanghai’s vice-mayor, Zong Ming, became visibly emotional as she acknowledged the hardship many have experienced. “We have not done our work well enough, and there is still a big gap from everyone’s expectations,” Zong said. “We will do our best to improve.”  In the meantime, communities have been banding together to form group-buying collectives — a model that has helped ease the supply crunch by bypassing delivery services such as Meituan and Ele.me. The neighborhood where Ye lives — a cluster of around 50 apartment blocks on the western side of the Huangpu River — began forming group-buying groups earlier this week. More than 300 people have now joined Ye’s milk and eggs WeChat group. Coordinating the deliveries is a labor-intensive job. Each time, Ye has to collect money from each group member herself, then coordinate the entire buying process: liaising with the suppliers, informing residents of delivery updates, and organizing volunteers to deliver the goods to each member’s front door. “Sometimes, not enough people participate, other times residents don’t pay in time,” says Ye. “But when we see a delivery truck coming into the neighborhood, there’s an uproar because we know the food is coming.” But Xu Wenwen, a resident of another neighborhood in the central Xuhui District, says the group-buying system has brought residents huge relief. Her compound has been locked down since March 18. She has received three packages of food — two from local authorities and one from her employer, a multinational company in Shanghai — during the lockdown. Yet these still weren't enough to feed her family of five, Xu says. “I lived in fear every day for a while, worrying about what I would do if I couldn’t get food,” she says. “I couldn’t fall asleep until 3 a.m. and I had to get up at 6 a.m. to try and order goods online. But I failed every day.”  In early April, Xu’s community set up a group-buying scheme, which finally brought food deliveries to thousands of residents. “I can finally sleep well,” Xu says. The group-buying schemes, however, are also generating controversy in some parts of the city. After hearing some of his neighbors were running out of food, Zhao — a resident of another residential compound in Xuhui District — organized a vegetable group-buying scheme for his community. The number of members has risen from 20 to more than 400, he says. But on Sunday afternoon, when Zhao and a group of volunteers went to receive a fresh delivery, the security guards and property managers at the compound refused to allow them to do so. They said group-buying was an infection risk and kept the compound gates closed, Zhao says. “I understand they’re worried that logistics and express deliveries bring hidden dangers of spreading the virus,” says Zhao. “But we also need to eat.” The 100 bags of vegetables are still sitting on the street outside the compound, Zhao says. Zhao is calling for residents in the group to try and reason with the guards and residential committee. “A lot of these vegetables were bought especially for the elderly,” says Zhao. “I’ll have to tell them now that we can’t buy anymore.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010087
"In Locked-Down Jilin, Worries Sprout Over Delayed Spring Plowing","While workers from cities are likely to return to their farmlands on time, transportation of agricultural materials faces snags.",2022-04-08,"Spring plowing in Jilin province is just two weeks away. But material and labor shortages in one of China’s agricultural heartlands due to the month-long coronavirus-related lockdown is posing threats to the region’s timely corn plantation and production. Many farmers and agriculture-related businesses in the northeastern province of over 24 million people have complained of difficulties in securing supplies, including fertilizers and pesticides due to the restrictions. The entire province was placed in lockdown around mid-March as COVID-19 infections started surging and topping the national tally. Farmers and business owners Sixth Tone spoke with and those sharing their struggles online said that though the provincial government promised green channels for agricultural goods late last month, transportation in some areas still faced hiccups. They said such roadblocks in China’s second largest corn production hub — Jilin accounts for about 10% of domestic corn production — could affect production and livelihoods. Mu Jing, a pesticide dealer in Tonghua City, told Sixth Tone that shipping from neighboring provinces with virus outbreaks and other bigger cities in Jilin were both restricted, disrupting inland transportation and posing logistical barriers to secure supplies. “Our goods haven’t been delivered,” Mu said. “The goods need to enter big cities to be transported to small cities. I am not sure when the highways to big cities will open.” On Thursday, Jilin reported 2,266 COVID-19 infections — the most after Shanghai — and its provincial capital Changchun is in its 29th day of a city-wide lockdown. Restrictions in other parts of the province still exist and vary depending on the locations. But as the ideal period for plantation nears, policymakers, agricultural companies, and farmers are grappling to ensure that staple crops can get in the ground on time. And it’s particularly urgent for corn. Even Pay, an analyst covering agriculture at strategic advisory firm Trivium China, said that corn only grows once a year and requires a suitable time for planting — it’s usually between the two weeks at the end of April and the beginning of May. Missing that window, she said, could prove harmful for the harvest. “Farm labor is stuck in lockdowns, the logistics for getting supplies to farms have been snarled by lockdowns,” Pay told Sixth Tone, listing the obstacles farmers faced. “Truck drivers are understandably hesitant to drive routes that will likely lead them to be quarantined. So it has been harder to get new shipments of seeds, agrochemicals, and equipment into Jilin from outside the province in recent weeks.” Amid complaints and distress calls from farmers and agro-based industries, the provincial authorities on Monday said that locked-down farmers in urban areas could return to their hometown farmlands from the following day. However, they were required to provide a negative COVID-19 test result and have had no close contact with infected individuals. A Changchun-based community volunteer, surnamed Yang, told Sixth Tone that they were collecting information about migrant workers who had applied to return to their hometowns for farming since Tuesday. Those willing to return were asked to seek permission from their residential community leader. “Arrangements for their return to their hometowns will be made soon but the specific time has not been announced,” Yang said. In Jiaohe County, 200 kilometers from Changchun, Du Fangli said she was hopeful that many of those who worked in her family farm would return Sunday. She said that over 20 young locals were being transported from Changchun in a bus, according to information circulating on the village chat group on messaging app WeChat. “Our village head will go to the village entrance in person to receive them,”Du said. “Only old farmers are left in the village. It’s impossible to finish spring plowing on time without the young returning.” But even with the young workers possibly arriving Sunday, Du said they’re facing another urgent issue in getting rid of the crop residues on time. Authorities have banned stubble burning since 2010 due to growing air pollution, with the restriction only becoming stricter in recent years. Du’s village is implementing a complete ban on stubble burning for the first time this year. But she is worried. “We are in a mountainous area, and it’s not suitable for machine work,” Du said. “Previously, the only way to get rid of stubbles was by burning them. We can’t really start plowing with the stubble still in the field.” Along with farmers, analysts say that many stores supplying farmers — especially smaller businesses in county towns and villages — were running short on stock this year. According to Pay from Trivium China, there were other factors contributing to the delayed supply of agricultural goods other than the lockdowns, including the energy shortfalls that started last year. “In particular, fertilizer is very energy intensive to produce,” she said. “So when energy prices go up, fertilizer prices also go up. Usually, fertilizer prices fall to their annual lows during the winter, and retailers and farmers stock up ahead of spring. But this year, prices didn’t really fall ... and many people waited, hoping that supply would rise and prices would fall.” Fertilizer and pesticide dealers like Mu said they were already facing difficulties in trying to secure supplies at a lower rate and then selling them for a profit. She said she had managed to overcome a similar crisis caused by the regional lockdown last February, but she was pessimistic this time. “My income for the whole year is completely dependent on this single sale, it can’t go wrong,” Mu said. “Last year, I still had enough time to react. Now, I have less than two weeks remaining (until plowing), and my goods haven’t even been shipped out of factories. There is no chance for me, I’m thinking of quitting.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010082
"Shanghai Readies ‘Shelter Hospital’ for 50,000 COVID-19 Patients","The city reported record coronavirus cases Thursday, as the country’s financial hub enters its second week of lockdown.",2022-04-08,"Shanghai is set to open its largest “shelter hospital” that can accomodate 50,000 COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms, authorities said Friday as daily infections continue to surge. The National Exhibition and Convention Center in the city’s Qingpu District spans around 600,000 square meters — the size of 84 soccer fields — and will temporarily serve as a shelter hospital starting Saturday, according to city authorities. Known as fangcang in Chinese, the supersized quarantine venues were first put to use during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Shanghai has been grappling to contain its worst COVID-19 outbreak since the first COVID-19 cases in the current wave were detected on March 1. The city logged another daily record of 21,222 cases for Thursday, with about 25 million residents in lockdown for a second week. China’s financial hub recorded 131,524 COVID-positive cases as of Thursday, of which 96% were said to be asymptomatic. Those showing symptoms were aged between 10 days and 98 years, with one patient in a severe condition, authorities said during a press conference Friday.Shanghai currently has four shelter hospitals directly managed by the city government, with 38,000 beds combined, according to the city’s housing and urban development authority. The city’s districts have also started operating smaller shelter hospitals with a total capacity of 21,000 beds, with provisions for an additional 20,000 beds.Despite a large number of beds in shelter hospitals, many residents who have tested positive in recent days said they were still waiting to be taken to the quarantine centers.Wu Song, who used a pseudonym citing privacy reasons, told Sixth Tone that he lives just 2 kilometers away from the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center, which has been turned into a shelter hospital.

How COVID Is Changing the Chinese Diet,"As lockdowns disrupt food chains across China, young Chinese are rediscovering the value of fresh food and home cooking.",2022-04-07,"Two years ago, the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the central city of Wuhan brought life in China skidding to a halt. Wet markets and stores shuttered their doors; food delivery services struggled to keep up with demand; and grocery apps ran out of stock. For the first time I could remember, finding enough food to eat was a problem. Living in Shanghai, hundreds of kilometers from Wuhan, I didn’t experience the worst of the shortages during the initial outbreak. I never thought it would be my city battling the country’s largest COVID-19 wave to date, or that history would repeat itself this way. But, as Shanghai has gone into an extended lockdown, finding food seems to be all anyone can talk about. Comedians joke about digging for vegetables in their neighborhoods, rappers craft rhymes about fighting over food, and residents scroll their social feeds for services still offering fresh vegetables. Curious how residents were coping with their straitened circumstances, I asked listeners of my podcast to share tips for obtaining and storing fresh food, as well as how to eat better during the pandemic. I got some interesting answers. Some young people said they were living off hometown specialties — mostly meat — sent from their families outside Shanghai. Others said they had reached out to their mothers to learn how to make preserved foods like pickled cabbages and dried vegetables. The COVID-19 pandemic is changing how and what we eat. This is most obvious during and after lockdowns, as young, takeout-dependent Chinese like me have little choice but to cook at home. But the longer the pandemic drags on, the more people I’ve noticed embracing cooking for its own sake. Some of the benefits of cooking at home are obvious. For one, it is significantly cheaper than eating out regularly. This dovetails with a renewed interest in frugality among young, economically anxious Chinese, as can be seen from the growing popularity of cheap, near-expired food. Market research firm iiMedia estimates the near-expired food industry will grow from 32 billion yuan a year in 2021 ($5 billion) to over 40 billion yuan by 2025. Other young people have embraced cooking as a stress reliever. It allows them to disengage from the pressures of their work or the latest depressing news and do something that they can control and find spiritually healing. For some, it’s even become a communal activity, whether in the form of group grocery shopping or potlucks showcasing dishes from your hometown. Once you start cooking at home, the more glaring the problems with China’s takeout industry become. From cheap, unsanitary packaging to the excessive use of oil, salt, and other additives, takeout offers a quick high and a harsh comedown. And that’s before accounting for plastic waste: Chinese scientists found the country’s takeout industry produced 1.5 million tons of plastic waste in 2017, up nearly eightfold in just two years. Making your own meals forces you to interact with and think about your food. From buying ingredients to storing them, from learning different cooking methods to understanding nutrition, home cooks begin to see foods in more varied and diverse ways. In my case, that has primarily involved composting. When Shanghai implemented a strict new waste-sorting system in 2019, dealing with “wet” cooking waste became a tiresome affair. After learning about home composting, I decided to give it a shot. Once I had successfully managed to produce fertilizer, it seemed a waste not to use it, so I decided to try my hand at another rising fad: a balcony garden. I’ve never had much of a green thumb, but I found growing vegetables refreshing. I felt like a student again, doing experiments in my room. When the seeds sprouted, I was so excited that I screamed. As an only child without any experience raising pets, I suddenly felt the joy of the birth of life.  Food waste activists often complain that the natural cycle of food production and decomposition breaks down in cities. They have a point. A 2019 report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that less than 2% of biological nutrients in food byproducts and organic waste in cities are reused, whether in compost or other forms. More tragically, the 98% of urban food waste that is not recycled often winds up in municipal landfills, where it not only isn’t put to productive use, but also can be actively harmful. To name just one example, food spoilage in landfills has been linked to increased methane emissions. This problem is particularly acute in China, where food waste typically accounts for about half of total municipal waste. Most of the time, these problems are easy to ignore amid the abundance of modern urban life. Perhaps only crises like the current pandemic have sufficient power to shock us and remind us how valuable and hard-earned our material abundance really is. But when we look around, what do we see? Comedy sketches aside, some Shanghai residents did consider harvesting the wild plants scattered across urban green belts, only to realize that they’re purely ornamental, not to mention coated with pesticides. It might be time for a different approach to urbanism. If so, food is a good place to start. It is the one part of nature no person, no matter how urbanized, can do without, and a renewed understanding of food — where it comes from, what it takes to produce, and how environmentally damaging our current system of industrialized food production can be — is vital if we are to navigate crises like climate change. Before COVID, I often ate takeout once or twice a week. In the past year, I can count on both hands the number of times I’ve ordered out. Many of my friends report similar experiences. It’s not always easy to find a silver lining to COVID-19, but it has made me realize that food is not just another commodity. It’s a gift from nature: something that binds us to our planet in ways both obvious and subtle. Sooner or later, we'll have to build a more sustainable food system. Why not now?

The Qualms and Queries of Locked-Down Shanghai Residents,"As the lockdown prolongs, residents are only getting more anxious.",2022-04-07,"Shanghai reported another daily record of nearly 20,000 COVID-19 infections for Wednesday, as the city continues to be in a strict lockdown. Many of the city’s 25 million people who are cooped up inside say they are struggling to replenish their daily food supplies, as stocks run out in minutes every morning. Meanwhile, online grocers are struggling to cope not just with surging demands but limited delivery workers — some couriers are even camping to keep the city running. Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, launched a helpline platform on March 24 to collect local residents’ requests for help and connect them with relevant government departments and neighborhood committees. It has since received over 2,000 requests, of which 85 have been made public. Those 85 requests made between March 25 and April 4 showed most respondents sought various medical assistance, while others were concerned about daily food supplies. Nearly half of all the issues faced by the respondents were resolved. A resident, surnamed Zhang from Pudong New Area, told Sixth Tone that his 77-year-old father, a uremic patient who requires hemodialysis treatment to clean his blood three times a week, waited for about five days to get admitted and receive treatment at a hospital on the other side of town Tuesday night. Zhang said he first turned to a local neighborhood committee — they told him to keep waiting — and received help after posting his plea on The Paper’s service platform. “I feel settled now, but I was so helpless at that time seeking help,” Zhang said. “The lockdown has disturbed patients’ timely access to medical care.” Amid growing unease from residents, Shanghai authorities have repeatedly said they would ensure their emergency medical needs and food supplies during the lockdown. The government hasn’t announced when they were likely to lift the restrictions yet. A 34-year-old resident, surnamed Qiu, told Sixth Tone that he spent 30 minutes on online grocery platforms early Wednesday after realizing the lockdown would likely be prolonged. But he failed to place any orders. “My food supplies will last for a week at most,” Qiu said. “I hope the follow-up testing and screening are done as soon as possible. We, ordinary people, cannot bear the extended lockdown for much longer.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010069
They Wanted to Feed Shanghai. It Can Mean Living in a Van for Weeks,"Empty restaurants, vans, and parks — food supply workers are searching for places to sleep as lockdowns separate them from home.",2022-04-06,"SHANGHAI — Yuan Ning has been sleeping on a pallet in an empty restaurant for nearly two weeks. The 30-something Shanghai butcher, like thousands of others, left his home while the city locked down to deliver food to residents.  The entirety of Shanghai has been under a lockdown order since April 1 as the city battles China’s largest-ever outbreak of COVID-19. Some areas, including much of the massive Pudong New Area, have been under lockdown even longer. Residents are mostly confined to their homes except to undergo testing, and many have encountered serious difficulties getting food. Shopkeepers and delivery drivers are a lifeline for millions of locked-down Shanghai residents. But to keep food deliveries running, many left their homes for improvised housing in workplaces or vehicles. As infections rose, some have stopped making deliveries, but are marooned outside locked-down homes. When nearby residential compounds were placed into lockdown on March 19, Yuan decided to help his regular customers get vegetables and meat. Two days before his home was locked down, he moved into a fast food franchise owned by a friend that closed during the lockdown and worked 12-14 hours preparing orders and making deliveries for a WeChat group of over 200 people, waking at 4 or 5 a.m. each day. He slept on a bed made out of two tables and a child’s mattress borrowed from his son, keeping the lights off at night to avoid being noticed. He gave a nickname to avoid being identified. Yuan told Sixth Tone that he finds meaning in helping his neighbors, but having no fixed abode is not easy. The father of three doesn’t know when he will go home, as the lockdown continues to be extended in the city. “Living in an unstable state is hard,” he said. Three other vendors and couriers who have been delivering food during the lockdowns told Sixth Tone that they have been sleeping in vehicles or their own grocery stores since their apartment complexes were sealed. During the full lockdown in Shenzhen last month, social media users in the city reported seeing delivery drivers sleeping on the streets; some were blocked from returning to their homes even if they had a special permit to work during the lockdown. The Shanghai Municipal Health Commission ordered March 27 that “health professionals, delivery workers, etc., with permits from workplaces can travel normally in the sealed districts.” But in reality, even health workers with passes have faced difficulty leaving residential compounds, and, once out, many have been prohibited from returning, the online community for healthcare professionals DXY.cn reported Saturday. For vendors like Yuan, who isn’t classified as a delivery worker, getting a permit from the neighborhood committee is impossible. He’s also not eligible for subsidies offered to essential workers during the pandemic. Like most wet market vendors, he rents his stall from a private landlord, so he’ll also miss out on rent relief in state-owned buildings. A 20-year-old courier at a ZTO Express station in Pudong, surnamed Geng, has been helping residents buy groceries in addition to his daily delivery job. He told Sixth Tone that he had been sleeping in a van with two colleagues since March 23, with a quilt his roommate dropped out of a window for him from their sealed apartment.Even though his company is one of the key enterprises that help ensure deliveries amid the pandemic and employees like Geng are essential workers in official definition, it could not help with his living situation. “Nearly half of our company’s dormitories are sealed. And the apartment complex we live in neither allows people to enter nor exit,” Geng told Sixth Tone.It falls to below 10℃ in Shanghai in early spring. Some of his colleagues, like his roommate, chose to stay in the sealed dormitory, but if he does that, “I won’t have any income,” Geng said.On March 29, Meituan, the largest food delivery platform in China, offered free rooms in 31 hotels to delivery workers in Shanghai. More than a hundred delivery drivers were reportedly housed in the hotels the first day.But a lot more vendors and couriers like Yuan and Geng are still living in unstable residences. Yuan’s deliveries ended on March 25, when a stallholder in the same market tested positive for COVID-19. Scared of contracting the virus or passing it to his two-year-old son, he went into voluntary isolation in the restaurant. He’s not sure about the reported 14-day incubation period, so he plans to remain there for 30 days before going home. He said when the outbreak ends, what he wants most is to go home, reunite with his family, and rest for a few days. He’s advised other stallholders to go home as soon as possible, for their own safety. Geng’s delivery station was completely closed on March 28, as Shanghai locked down the entire east side of the city. At first, he and his two partners stayed in the van and continued to help residents buy daily necessities. But on March 30, as case counts were rising, Geng lost access to the van. He stopped making deliveries and moved into a tent lent by a customer. One of his two partners found another van, and is still making deliveries with a new team.“It is a difficult time and residents need more help than usual,” Geng said. “I just think that I could not step back.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010059
China’s Holiday Travel Sees 26% Drop Amid COVID-19 Outbreak,Tighter restrictions and lockdowns in major tourist hubs like Shanghai have affected revenue during the Qingming Festival holidays.,2022-04-06,"China’s tourism sector has taken a direct hit amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks in several cities, as both the number of trips and revenue fell sharply over the three-day Qingming Festival holiday that ended Tuesday.  The Ministry of Culture and Tourism said Tuesday that an estimated 75 million domestic trips were made during the Qingming Festival, down by 26.2% from last year. The trips accounted for only 68% from the same period in 2019. Hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the Qingming Festival — also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day — either to honor their ancestors in their burial grounds or for leisure. But virus outbreaks have often led to people not traveling and paying their tributes virtually instead – over 21 million online tomb-sweeping activities were held during the three-day holiday, up by 192% from a year earlier. Officials forecasted that the three-day holiday this month generated only 18.78 billion yuan ($2.95 billion) in domestic tourism revenue. The amount was 30.9% lower than the same period last year. On Monday, the second day of the holiday, trips on China’s railway networks dipped by 82.7% compared with last year’s holiday period, according to the Ministry of Transport. Meanwhile, air traffic was reduced by nearly 90% this year compared with the Qingming holiday in 2021. A Beijing-based college student, surnamed Nie, told Sixth Tone that she spent the holiday in the southwestern city of Chongqing for a few days, mostly driving and traveling to remote mountainous areas. “During the trip, I was worried about whether a sudden outbreak would hit either Chongqing or Beijing,” Nie said, adding that she feared being trapped while vacationing. While some people were able to travel despite stricter restrictions, about 25 million residents in Shanghai were confined to their homes. The only time they ventured out Monday was to take a COVID-19 test. Zhang Qun, a 29-year-old from Shanghai, said she took photos of flowers and plants in her compound after the test and posted them on social media. She usually traveled outside the city during the three-day holiday. “I’ve never truly appreciated the flowers in my compound,” Zhang told Sixth Tone on Wednesday. “I hope we can travel again for the upcoming Labor Day holiday.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010062
Shanghai Adjusts COVID-19 Policy Separating Children and Parents,The city is allowing “shelter hospitals” to accommodate infected minors along with at least one family member.,2022-04-06,"Shanghai is allowing healthy family members of children infected with the coronavirus to stay together at the city’s centralized quarantine locations, relaxing a policy that previously separated minors from their families, local media reported Tuesday. The policy has been implemented at a “shelter hospital” — or fangcang — in the city’s Pudong New Area that can house nearly 15,000 patients with mild or no symptoms, according to the media report, citing people in charge of the hospital. The hospital had admitted its first group of 89 children along with at least one family member by Tuesday morning. The leniency in the city government’s policy came after days of unease by anxious parents scrambling to get information about their children in centralized quarantine centers. Some of the separated children even included infants. “The policy has come as a big relief to me,” a Shanghai mother surnamed Fang, with children aged 2 and 8, told Sixth Tone. The shelter hospital in Pudong, which is a refurbished exhibition center, has set aside a separate area for patients as young as 2 years old. Medical staff in charge of the area told local media that nearly 1,000 beds have been arranged to accommodate nearly 500 families. “More than 80% of the kids’ parents have also been infected,” said the staff dispatched from Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. “We provide the small group of COVID-negative parents with corresponding arrangements under the precondition that they’re fully informed of the risks.” In March, over 300 infected children aged 6 and below were quarantined in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, previously the city’s only designated hospital to treat COVID patients, according to the city’s top health authority. Parents were barred from accompanying or visiting the children. “I’m especially worried about my younger child,” Fang said. “The virus could do more harm to him and he’s completely unable to take care of himself or even express himself properly.” The increasing number of her neighbors getting infected has added to the mother’s anxiety. Shanghai reported another daily high of 17,077 infections for Tuesday, as the city of around 25 million people continues to be in lockdown. A preprint study, analyzing data from Hong Kong, suggested that the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant of the coronavirus “is not mild as evident by the fatality and severe complications of the uninfected and unvaccinated children.” Hong Kong separated up to 2,000 children under the age of 10 from their parents after being infected with the virus, according to a local charity. But authorities reversed its decision last week, saying they would allow parents to accompany their children in pediatric wards, regardless of their COVID-19 status. In Shanghai, the city’s decision has brought relief to parents. “I can finally sleep well,” Fang said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010061
"Remembering the Dead, Without Going Outside","As China passes its third Tomb-Sweeping Day of the pandemic, millions of locked-down people are looking for digital alternatives to traditional rituals.",2022-04-05,"It’s the Qingming festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day — a time for Chinese families to visit their dead relatives, clean their tombs, and offer food and symbolic money in a solemn ceremony of remembrance. It’s a three-day public holiday. It’s also the third year of China’s fight against COVID-19, and due to the country’s “Zero-COVID” strategy, many haven’t been able to visit their loved one because of quarantine measures and travel restrictions. Usually on this day, 28-year-old Shanghai resident Tang and his family would gather together, fold yellow foil into the shape of gold taels, and burn it in front of his grandfather’s tomb as part of a local version of the ritual offering of money to the dead. But as Shanghai extended a lockdown that was planned to be lifted on Tuesday, he was not able to go to the cemetery in Qingpu district to visit his grandfather. Shanghai authorities announced a pair of five-day half-city lockdowns March 28, but as cases continued to rise, the entire city is now under lockdown with no announced end date. “Visiting my grandfather at Qingming was important for our family,” Tang told Sixth Tone, only giving his surname to protect his privacy, “not only can we remember my grandfather, but was a chance for the family members to get together and bond with each other.” Zhao, a university student in Shanghai, lost her mother last October after a sudden illness. She’s been quarantined on campus for almost a month due to a COVID-19 cluster, and could only look at pictures of her relatives cleaning her mother’s grave. Zhao posted a letter to her mother on the Twitter-like service Weibo: “Mom, please don’t worry that I will forget you. I will never forget you. I miss you. I miss your soft voice, your warm hug, your always-warm hands and your ever-young face… When things get back to normal in Shanghai. I will come back to see you. I promise.” “This is the first year since her death and I was supposed to go back to visit her grave for sure,” she told Sixth Tone. “I understand the authorities’ measures, but I’m sad that I can’t visit my mother at this special time.” READ MORE: When We Die, What Becomes of Our Digital Lives? While residents of Shanghai, and other cities including Haining in Zhejiang province, and Changchun and Jilin in Jilin province, are not allowed to leave their homes due to citywide lockdowns, authorities in other Chinese cities including Shenzhen canceled tomb sweeping in cemeteries, and encouraged citizens to remember their loved ones online. Many cemeteries are offering replacement services including virtual tomb visits and digital flowers and candles. Tang said he had heard that his grandfather’s cemetery offers online services, but he doesn’t think paying the staff to send flowers could replace the experience of visiting the loved one in person. “I feel quite sorry that I can’t visit him,” he said, “but I’m sure he will understand.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010055

Shanghai Seeks to Test 25 Million in One Day,"Saying the city’s outbreak is now larger than Wuhan, the megacity races to give COVID-19 tests to its entire population.",2022-04-04,"SHANGHAI – Millions got up early on a holiday Monday, filing downstairs in pajamas to take part in what is likely the world’s largest-ever single-day COVID-19 surveillance effort. Shanghai is seeking to test its 25 million residents on Monday, following an announcement on Sunday. While most of China is enjoying a three-day vacation for the Qingming festival, Shanghai is trying to halt the country’s largest-ever COVID-19 outbreak, which has infected over 40,000 people in the past 10 days. Chen Erzhen, a vice president at the city’s renowned Ruijin Hospital, said Saturday “the scale of the cluster this time is bigger than Wuhan.” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan arrived in Shanghai on Saturday, with a message that China will stick to its “Zero-Covid” strategy. The People’s Liberation Army also sent 2,000 soldiers Sunday to assist Shanghai’s medical work. Wang Xiaoxiao, a 40-year-old who lives in Huangpu district, woke up at 7:30 am after hearing community officials call residents downstairs for testing. The station is a couple of folding tables under a blue tent. Residents were asked to line up while keeping social distance, register in an app to generate a QR code, and then wait to be swabbed by medical staff wearing hazmat suits. “The process is quite fast. I waited for less than five minutes and finished the test.” Wang told Sixth Tone at the test site, still wearing pajamas. “I really hope we can finish the lockdown as soon as possible.” Immediately after the test, lockdown rules require everyone to go back into their apartments. The city government announced a two-phase lockdown March 27, running from March 28 to April 1 on the river’s east bank, called Pudong; and from April 1 to 4 on the west bank, Puxi. But authorities said Saturday that the lockdown in most of Pudong will be extended by at least nine days due to rapid growth of new cases detected in the area. It’s unclear whether the lockdown in Puxi will be lifted as planned on Tuesday, 3 a.m.. A community official who works at Huaihai sub-district told Sixth Tone it has not been confirmed. “We are all waiting for notice from the authorities. We don’t know when we can lift the lockdown,” she said. Before the cluster in March, Shanghai had won a reputation for “precise Covid-19 prevention and control” strategy. Other Chinese cities and provinces including Tianjin, Xi’an, and Jilin started mass testing or lockdowns soon after detecting their first cases, slowing the spread at the cost of major disruptions to daily life. During previous outbreaks, Shanghai managed to control the virus efficiently with targeted measures during previous outbreaks. In January, the government marked the smallest “elevated risk area” in China, a 20 square meter bubble tea shop.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010052
Shanghai’s Quarantine System Strained by Flood of Cases,"The city is looking for beds for 30,000 asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers as it battles a major outbreak.",2022-04-03,"As Shanghai fights China’s largest COVID-19 outbreak since the first wave, tens of thousands of people with mild or no symptoms are waiting in exhibition centers, stadiums, and empty apartment buildings. Isolating mild and asymptomatic cases to prevent transmission is a pillar of China’s “COVID zero” strategy. But with nearly 37,000 cases logged in March, Shanghai is struggling to find places to put them. Public buildings have been converted into temporary “shelter hospitals,” or fangcang, adding tens of thousands of beds to relieve pressure on the public health system. In the face of rising cases, the country updated guidelines on March 15 to allow patients with mild symptoms to be sent to centralized quarantine facilities instead of hospitals. Chen Erzhen, head of Shanghai’s central quarantine treatment team, told state-run media People’s Daily on Friday that COVID patients admitted to centralized quarantine facilities can be discharged after testing negative twice in a row. The process usually takes seven to ten days for asymptomatic patients, according to Chen. The city has reported over 51,000 infections since March 1, including 35,949 asymptomatic cases in the last seven days. On Sunday, the first batch of over 200 patients were set to be discharged from the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center, domestic media reported. Despite two exhibition halls, two sports stadiums, and empty apartment buildings being put into place as quarantine facilities, some patients who tested positive have been stranded at home, wholesale markets, a nursing home, or at hospitals, waiting to be transferred to isolation sites. Viral posts online showed vendors sealed in a wholesale vegetable market in Minhang District, and they had been sleeping on the concrete floor for more than ten days. They have been transferred out in batches starting from Friday night, online videos taken by vendors showed. Guo Xiaolin, a 30-year-old resident of the Pudong New Area, told Sixth Tone that she was stuck at a makeshift quarantine site made of converted shipping containers at Pudong Hospital for about two days, after a self test came back positive on Wednesday. “Ambulances would first transfer out the elderly, children, and pregnant women, with eight people in a car,” she said, adding she was transferred to a centralized quarantine facility in Chongming District Friday night after waiting for hours on a bus. Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center, located in Pudong, is one of the main facilities built for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. It now holds over 7,000 COVID-19 patients. Video clips and photos taken by admitted patients there show dense, uncovered compartments in an open space, reminding many of the first makeshift facilities set up during the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan two years ago. Several patients at the exhibition hall told Sixth Tone they have done their best to adapt to quarantine life, despite arduous living conditions. All said they are healthy, after suffering symptoms like fever and aches earlier in their infections. A designer surnamed Sun said she was admitted Monday morning, and watches TV dramas and draws on her iPad to kill time at the quarantine site. She withheld her given name due to privacy concerns.  “I was nervous at first, and felt like it was the first time I was so close to the virus. I didn’t know anyone around me, and everything here was confusing,” said the 25-year-old. Sun hasn’t had a shower or change of clothes since Monday. Men and women are not separated in the facility. It also takes her nearly an hour to fall asleep, as the hall is filled with noises from thousands of people, ranging from snoring and babies’ crying to phone calls. “The noise annoys me, but I can’t do anything about it. I just put on my earphones,” Sun said. Zhao Jun, who runs a small dining business in the northern province of Hebei, came to Shanghai in early March to study Western-style cuisine, but got infected and was admitted to the exhibition center site before dawn on March 27 after a week in a hospital. After testing positive March 20, the 27-year-old said he was afraid that the infection would affect his colleagues and roommates, but was relieved after they showed sympathy. Zhao tries to keep a normal pace of life at the facility: reading, drinking a cup of coffee, and exercising for two hours a day, mainly by running five kilometers in circles inside the hall. He’s also volunteered to assist medical staff in distributing meals and medicine to patients. Zhao documents his everyday life at the exhibition center on lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu, and spends up to two hours at night editing video footage and replying to comments from netizens. “I’m trying to deliver some positive information to people that quarantine is normal, to relieve their anxiety and make myself enriched,” he said. But for Gong Jian, a 44-year-old conference planner, life in quarantine is dominated by anxiety, with his biggest concern being cross-infection. “Thousands of people with mild or no symptoms are staying in an open space without being isolated from each other. This is more dangerous than self-isolation. I could get infected by others again and slow my recovery from the infection,” Gong said. He said he believes he was infected when waiting at the fever clinic in Pudong Hospital on March 23, and was among the first batch admitted to the converted exhibition hall Saturday night. He uses his smartphone for about eight hours a day to keep pace with COVID-19 news and watches short videos on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.  “The lights are bright all the time inside the venue, making you feel the day and the night are the same,” Gong said. “You only have the space of a bed to yourself. You just stay in bed if you don’t move around.” Gong said that sometimes there is a lack of manpower and supplies at the site. He received his dinner around 8 p.m. on Wednesday, about two hours late. He also didn’t receive his regular dose of traditional Chinese medicine from medical staff that day, though he received three packets for the following three days on Thursday. Shanghai New International Expo Centre, another exhibition center, has started to admit those who tested positive for COVID-19 since Thursday night. It covers over 300,000 square meters and can receive over 15,000 patients, making it the largest centralized quarantine site in Shanghai. “We require medical staff to try hard to meet patients' needs. Many of them arrived there late night, and the quarantine site prepared bread and light snacks for them,” health expert Chen told domestic media on Friday. If there are too many cases with no symptoms, it is “likely” that those who meet certain conditions will be allowed to conduct strict self-isolation at home in the future, Chen said. Gong hopes he can get out soon and be quarantined in a hotel or at home alone, but has to accept the reality at the moment. He walks to a glass wall three to four times a day to see the outside world and takes a few minutes of exercise. “I don’t usually think about it, but freedom matters,” he said. “Even to breathe air for a bit outside would make me happy.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010043
Shanghai Sees Rise in Mental Health Issues Amid COVID-19 Surge,"The city’s psychological support helplines are flooded with calls, with many expressing anxiety over virus control measures.",2022-04-02,"SHANGHAI — Shanghai’s mental health hotlines have been receiving an increase in calls since the city started a two-phase lockdown Monday, with many anxious residents calling to discuss conditions heightened by the city’s COVID-19 outbreak. Mental health counselors in Pudong New Area, where the lockdown that was supposed to end Friday has largely been extended, said their phones have been continuously ringing throughout the day. The district, also the city’s financial hub, has five hotlines — three of them operate 24 hours — with over 100 volunteers providing various counseling services amid the outbreak. “I started at 8 a.m. and by 4 p.m, I have received 40 calls,” one of the hotline staff told Sixth Tone. Shanghai is currently experiencing its worst COVID-19 outbreak since the pandemic started, logging record daily infections this week. The city reported 6,311 cases on Friday and over 36,000 of them in March — and while the numbers were far less than elsewhere globally, it’s a dramatic surge for a country still sticking with the “zero-COVID” strategy. While the pandemic has affected the physical health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, it has also taken a heavy toll on the mental wellbeing of individuals. Countries around the world have reported an uptick in mental health issues, while the World Health Organization called on governments to step up support last month after witnessing a 25% rise in the prevalence of anxiety and depression globally in the first year of the pandemic. In Shanghai’s downtown Changning District, where the lockdown started Friday, the 24-hour government-backed mental health hotline has received over 200 calls in March, each lasting about 26 minutes on average, according to Zhu Wei, one of the people in charge. The number of daily calls was about 20% more than other times. “Many called because of lockdown anxiety and some sought help to secure medicine,” Zhu told Sixth Tone on Thursday. “Some callers didn’t specifically call due to the outbreak, but we can sense that it’s related. For example, a couple who called had fought over their kids’ online education.”  A college student, who only gave her surname Li, said that she was stressed to be in another COVID-19 hotspot again. She had left Wuhan just when the virus started emerging there early in the pandemic, only to see a surge in her hometown in the central Hubei province. Now, she is caught in Shanghai’s lockdown. “I’m having PTSD,” Li told Sixth Tone, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. “At home, the lockdown didn’t seem this intimidating because I was with my family and had enough food.” Li said most of her anxieties are associated with not being able to get enough food and she started to panic after learning about the lockdown. At 5 a.m. on Tuesday, she tried to order from various delivery apps but failed. “Everything was sold out in a second,” Li said, adding she was able to buy some fruit but was later told they wouldn’t be delivered due to a lack of couriers. “There was the thrill (of waiting), and then there was a huge disappointment. I can’t stand uncertainty.” So far, Li said she hasn’t tried psychological counseling. “I’m afraid of being recorded in the free hotline’s system,” she said. “I also don’t want to pay for (other) sessions. I escape reality by watching TV shows.” Meanwhile, another Shanghai resident, surnamed Yang, has been paying for weekly psychological consulting sessions for about two years, mainly to deal with intimacy and relationship issues. She had her latest session with her therapist Wednesday, where she shared how the lockdown has affected her. “Two years ago, I was most afraid of the unknown virus, but this time the secondary problems caused by the epidemic make me anxious,” the 33-year-old said. “With relationship advice, I can work on them right away and see the results, but with the (virus), I feel powerless. I don’t have the individual power to make any changes.” Cheng Qing, who lives in Xuhui District, told Sixth Tone that she started to become anxious when the number of infections in Shanghai increased to over 1,000 every day. She said she was more worried about her pet cats after reading tragic news over the mistreatment of animals in other places. “I don’t know how I would react if anything happened to my cats,” she told Sixth Tone. Amid the outbreak, many Shanghai residents have resorted to self-help support groups as well. Many, including Cheng, have turned to mental health-related apps and guided meditation.  “At least now we have all sorts of help we can get with ease,” said the 28-year-old. “It would be so much harder if this (lockdown) happened 10 years ago.” Carrie Jones, a counseling professional from the nonprofit Community Center Shanghai, whose clientele were mostly English speakers, told Sixth Tone on Saturday that there has been an increase in people seeking support recently and subsequently sharing information about free sessions on social media. “I think it’s comforting to the community just to know that this support is available, like a safety net, whether they actually utilize it or not,” Jones said. When the virus surge in Shanghai started in early March and residents were locked down in targeted quarantines — only buildings with infected patients and their close contacts were sealed — Jones said many of her calls were about relationship issues. As the quarantines got longer and with the beginning of lockdown, people were getting stressed in general, struggling with anxiety, uncertainty, fear, loneliness, a lack of reliable information, and a lack of control. She said the nonprofit organization also offered similar support in 2020 when people feared the then unknown virus, with most of them experiencing separation anxiety from families. For many, the situation in Shanghai has triggered past memories. “It comes on top of two years of many people not being able to travel home or see families,” Jones said, referring to China’s strict border control measures. “The situation is so fluid and rapidly changing.” Phone numbers for Shanghai’s mental health hotlines can be found here.

Lockdown Tests Shanghai’s Food Delivery Services,Suppliers stress the city has plenty of food. The problem is getting it into customers’ hands.,2022-04-01,"SHANGHAI — It was 9 a.m. Wednesday, and hundreds of people were queuing outside of a Hema supermarket in Shanghai’s Huangpu District. As the shop opened, they all had one mission: stock up on food before the lockdown. Due to thousands of daily new COVID-19 cases over the past week, the Shanghai government announced Sunday a two-phase lockdown measure to make its 25 million residents quarantine at home. Now, many residents are facing a new problem: food. Vegetable and meat shelves have been emptied in many Shanghai supermarkets. Residents said it’s been nearly impossible to place an order to do online grocery shopping for days. Panic buying is so widespread that a rap about it went viral last weekend. Vegetable wholesalers in Shanghai told Sixth Tone the reason for the difficulty of buying groceries is not lack of supply, but logistics. While residents in more open areas are able to get groceries relatively easily, those living in areas severely affected by COVID-19 and lockdowns are having a more difficult time. People have sought to stock up at least five days of food in preparation for a rolling lockdown, and many have sought much larger supplies in case the lockdowns are extended. A 45-year-old who gave his name as Li waited one hour to get into Hema Wednesday morning. He said it was his second trip in two days to the Alibaba-backed supermarket. Li spent over 1,000 yuan ($157) stocking up on essentials — vegetables, fruit, water, and rice — for the coming quarantine. “I came here yesterday afternoon and found the shelves empty. I was very afraid we would not have enough food for the quarantine,” Li told Sixth Tone. “It’s better to prepare well. We don’t know how long the quarantine will last.” “We have enough stock, the problem is a lack of manpower,” a representative of Hema told Sixth Tone. “The empty shelves are because we don’t have enough staff to put food out. And many of our delivery people are also quarantined.” To solve the problem, the company is using the “shared employee” strategy to hire employees from partner companies, including restaurants. Meanwhile, the Shanghai government is also giving free food to some of the residents under lockdown. According to Shanghai authorities, residents must stay at home during the citywide lockdown, with no breaks for shopping. The lockdown might extend beyond five days if positive cases are detected during the mass testing. Not everyone is as lucky as Li. Many Shanghai residents were already stuck at home due to previous lockdown measures and did not have a chance to go out for groceries after the announcement. In the east part of the city, residents had less than nine hours to prepare after the five-day lockdown was announced. Even before the citywide lockdown, residents say, delivery services were overwhelmed by demand. Jiang, who has been under lockdown for three weeks in her apartment in Minhang District on the west side of the city, told Sixth Tone that grocery delivery apps usually hit capacity limits within minutes after starting to take orders each day. “I had to rely on instant noodles for several days,” she said, adding that the situation got better after her community officials arranged group purchases for the neighborhood. Ni Qingfeng, owner of Pudong-based grocery supplier Shuyuan Planting Cooperative, told Sixth Tone they have plenty of food in stock. The problem is getting it into the city. “We do have enough vegetables and fruit, the problem is delivering them,” said Ni, who has been sleeping only three hours per day due to his heavy workload. To drive during the lockdown, vans require special permits from the city. Ni told Sixth Tone he got permits for only five vans – which were not enough to handle the influx of orders. They will need to coordinate with the Shanghai authorities to prioritize customers in need. Once they make a delivery, they’ll leave food outside an apartment complex for local staff to make door to door deliveries. Wang Fengmei, who works at another vegetable supplier in Pudong, described similar plans. She added that due to the difficulty of transportation and lack of delivery methods, they were asked to prioritize orders from Pudong, which entered lockdown first, and could deliver to Puxi beginning April 2.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010045
"Update: Portraits of Four Lockdowns, in Graphs",How four Chinese cities responded to the country’s largest COVID-19 outbreak since 2020.,2022-04-01,"On the last day of March, China added 1,787 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 5,442 asymptomatic infections. These two figures represent a huge increase from our last count, on March 16. Since we charted outbreaks in four cities two weeks ago, situations have changed dramatically. Shanghai has become the center of this outbreak. Numbers of confirmed cases and asymptomatic infections in the city are still increasing daily. Until March 28, the city relied on limited lockdowns, targeting close contacts and testing “key areas.” But as case counts soared, the city adopted a more aggressive strategy. The city is divided by the Huangpu River into two parts. The east bank has been locked down since March 28. The west entered lockdown today, and will remain closed until at least April 5.  Meanwhile, the southern border city of Shenzhen has all put this outbreak behind it. After two weeks of general lockdown, the Shenzhen government announced the city’s return to normalcy March 27. Schools, offices, and public places have reopened, and almost all anti-COVID measures have ended, with the exception of requirements for residents to take regular tests.  In the northeast, the hard-hit cities of Jilin and Changchun are holding steady at total lockdown. Local governments are now putting more attention on getting supplies to their residents.  According to the government of Changchun, by midnight March 27, a total of 44,000 vegetable kits were distributed to residents, ranging in price from 40 yuan to 300 yuan ($6.3 - $47). These packages included potatoes, cabbages, leeks, spinach, zucchini, tomatoes, eggplants, and other common vegetables. Some also contained meat, fruit, and noodles.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010044
Traders and Truck Drivers Struggle Amid Inland Transport Disruptions,"Shanghai ports continue to receive international ships as normal, but surrounding provinces and cities are rejecting container trucks from the city.",2022-03-31,"As Shanghai shuts down, one half at a time, factories across east China are facing a wave of canceled and delayed shipments. The port of Shanghai, the world’s largest by trading volume according to the World Shipping Council, is continuing to load and unload ships, but getting containers into the city is another story as many neighboring cities restrict travel from Shanghai. Truck drivers trying to leave Shanghai have described hours-long waits at health checkpoints, 100-kilometer detours, and long quarantines after journeys, among other challenges. Many said they plan to keep driving. Many exporters, however, said the delays are making the difference between narrow profits and losses. “Export shipments by sea and by air have been greatly affected by the recent lockdown in Shanghai,” Gong Peipei, a Jiaxing-based shipping agent, told Sixth Tone. “The main reason is that containers can’t be shipped out of Shanghai, factories can’t get containers to put their goods in, and bulk cargo can’t be sent to Shanghai warehouses for air transport.” She added that almost no cities in neighboring provinces are allowing trucks from Shanghai to enter them. “Logistics delays will last a long time, even after the lifting of lockdown due to the huge amount of unshipped cargo.” Many manufacturers in the nearby provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu rely on Shanghai’s ports to ship their goods overseas. Even in cities farther away, such as Yiwu in south Zhejiang, exporters rely on Shanghai’s airports for air cargo, Gong said. Container throughput at the port of Shanghai has remained at high levels — around 140,000 twenty-foot equivalent units — during the recent COVID-19 outbreak, according to the Shanghai International Port Group.  “Shanghai airports, railways, and international passenger and freight operations will be in normal operation,” authorities said at a press conference Monday, while announcing the twin lockdown plan. Staff at major ports in the east part of the city have lived on site since Monday, allowing them to continue working during a five-day lockdown. But getting shipments to the ports is a major challenge. Danish shipping company Maersk predicted that truck shipments in and out of the city would fall by 30% in a note to clients on Monday, according to Reuters. Truck drivers said it was very difficult to leave Shanghai even before the current lockdowns. “The inspection of nucleic acid reports and travel history has been extremely strict,” Liu Shengfeng, a truck driver who had been in Shanghai before the lockdown, told Sixth Tone. “If you’re missing either one, the driver won’t be allowed in.”  Liu said he picked up some goods in Shanghai and headed to Suzhou, in Jiangsu province, on March 16, and waited more than five hours at the highway exit for inspection. Upon returning home, he faced another week in his truck. Since March, Liu’s village in the eastern Shandong province requires those who came back from other cities and provinces to all go through a seven-day quarantine. He chose to stay in his truck, because if he quarantined at home, his wife and child would have to quarantine with him, he said. He’s now on the fifth day. Another driver said on video streaming platform Kuaishou March 11 that he wasn’t allowed to leave the highway on a 100-kilometer trip from a Shanghai port to Taicang. He drove another 100 kilometers to the city of Changshu before being allowed to exit the highway, then doubled back and completed his delivery.  Since the lockdown, the situation has gotten worse. As the prevention and control in other cities intensified, it has been almost impossible for truckers to leave Shanghai, four sources told Sixth Tone. “There is one way to move goods, but it will double the shipping cost and write off the profit margin,” Yiwu-based trader Tony Zhao told Sixth Tone. “It is allowed to load goods into containers at service areas on highways. So we can order one container truck from Shanghai port to a service area in the middle, and then order another truck to take goods from the factory and meet them. Not many people choose this way.” For some exporters, the delays mean canceled orders. Zheng Chuanqing, a Yiwu-based trader specializing in waterproof zippers, told Sixth Tone that the recent outbreak in Shanghai inflicted a serious blow on his export business. “My major customers are all in Ukraine. Because of the war, a lot of goods I shipped to Ukraine are now stuck in Turkey. Those goods are basically lost, as they can’t be returned. Many of my customers have not paid for the goods, so I owe my suppliers millions of yuan,” Zheng said. “Then I was about to ship some bulk cargo to Pudong airport before the lockdown. It was an urgent order from Sri Lanka. The client canceled the order as soon as I said it was going to be delayed.” “Truck drivers suffer the most,” Zhao said. “The situation was similar when COVID-19 broke out in the port of Ningbo last year. If they came to load goods in Yiwu, all the drivers would eat, drink, and use the bathroom inside the truck. The windows of the truck were all sealed with newspapers.” Nearly 100 truck drivers were investigated and punished in the northeastern province Liaoning for concealing their travel histories, Xinhua reported Wednesday. Among them, some truck drivers carried two or more mobile phones, and showed the one without “stars” when they were inspected, the report said. Despite the difficulties, many drivers are staying on the road. “COVID-19 can suspend a school or a factory, but the only one who can’t be stopped is the truck driver,” Ma Yonghui, who is quarantined in a hotel in Yichang in Hubei province, told Sixth Tone, adding he sympathized with the punished truck drivers. Ma’s health code turned yellow as soon as he entered Hubei because he had passed a high risk area in Jiangsu. He placed in a 14-day quarantine, and said he’s worried about the lost income. “I will continue to deliver goods once I am out, because I know there must be someone who desperately needs their goods transported at this critical moment,” Ma said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010033
Shanghai Counts Down Hours to Lockdown Switch,A visual story documenting the mood of the city facing its worst coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began.,2022-03-31,"SHANGHAI — Shanghai has come to a standstill. The city of nearly 25 million people is all but deserted, and is silent enough that the spring breeze can be heard. There’s a sense of foreboding as COVID-19 infections soar — from a single case on March 1 to over 5,600 on March 30 — at a dramatic rate in a city that had only logged a few hundred locally transmitted infections throughout the pandemic. As cases rose, residential complexes across the city were locked down, while those diagnosed with the virus sent to hospitals and quarantine sites. Men and women in personal protective clothing, nicknamed “big white,” are scattered everywhere, making it feel like time has been set back to 2020. Nearly half the city — the part east of the Huangpu River that splits Shanghai — has been locked down from Monday through Friday. Residents had only hours to stock up on groceries following an abrupt announcement Sunday evening. Meanwhile, the other half has had ample time to empty supermarket shelves while waiting for a five-day quarantine starting Friday. Sixth Tone sent photographers Shi Yangkun, Zhou Pinglang, and Wu Huiyuan across Shanghai’s neighborhoods in the west of the city to document the mood before they’re sealed on Friday. The photos were taken between March 28-31.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010022
Provinces Send Health Workers to Help Shanghai’s COVID-19 Response,The city of nearly 25 million is testing all residents during a two-phase lockdown.,2022-03-31,"SHANGHAI — Medical teams from two neighboring provinces arrived in Shanghai this week to offer assistance, as the city’s health system comes under immense pressure amid a rising number of COVID-19 infections. About 3,500 health care workers from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces will mostly assist in conducting mass nucleic acid tests on residents in lock down, according to local authorities. On Sunday evening, Shanghai announced a two-phase lockdown from March 28 to April 5, splitting the city in two halves to test its nearly 25 million residents. By Wednesday, the areas east of the Huangpu River and currently in lockdown had completed testing on all its residents. Around 20 million nucleic acid tests have been conducted in those areas during the two rounds of screening. Wang Weijun, coordinator for the medical team from Zhejiang, told Sixth Tone that around 3,000 health care workers have arrived in Shanghai between Monday and Wednesday. All have been tasked with supporting the work in the Pudong New Area, home to the city’s financial hub. “The teams were assembled at short notice and have worked long hours each day,” Wang said, adding that the 3,000 members have been divided into two teams. “It will be sustainable to have two teams in rotation.” Shanghai is currently experiencing its worst COVID-19 outbreak since the pandemic started in early 2020. With the city reporting thousands of cases every day — over 5,600 infections were reported on Wednesday — authorities have erected temporary “shelter hospitals” — or fangcang — and converted exhibition centers into quarantine facilities for those diagnosed with COVID-19. A nurse from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital in Hangzhou said she was notified of the assignment in Shanghai at 1 a.m. on Monday and was already in Pudong just after 8 a.m. the same day. The bus journey between the two cities usually takes about two hours. “The system here is different than in Zhejiang,” she said without elaborating, as she helped elderly residents register for the test on their smartphones. “The major challenge is to ensure that the older people get the right QR codes.” Since China started implementing digital health codes and online registrations for nucleic acid tests, many older residents have complained about struggling to keep up with the technology. Wang said the medical team returned to Zhejiang after completing their tasks for the day, as Shanghai struggled to free up spaces for the patients. He said the health workers were transported to hotels about 150 kilometers away in the city of Huzhou. “A team of 500 medical workers from Jiangsu are also helping conduct nucleic acid tests, and a 1,000-member team is expected to arrive from Anhui province,” he said. While health workers in the grassroots are spending long hours testing residents, those working at hospitals said they faced immense pressure to ensure their services weren’t interrupted. Shanghai’s health authority has asked all local hospitals to keep their emergency and outpatient services running. “We’re getting tested everyday,” a doctor at a top hospital in Pudong told Sixth Tone, declining to be named as she was not authorized to speak to the media. “There have been positive samples found in the hospital environment from time to time.” The doctor said her hospital requires a negative nucleic test report from the past 48 hours from patients and their families visiting the emergency room. Hospitals in other cities experiencing outbreaks usually have similar rules, which have led to delays in treatments and even deaths. “But this is not a must for outpatients — the hospital follows the health authority’s guideline of serving those with medical needs,” she said. “It puts us at risk, but my colleagues are risking more while taking care of thousands of positive patients in the shelter hospitals.” She said many hospital workers, including herself, were staying at work instead of going home in case of any emergencies. After a long shift, she said they pull out a folding bed to sleep in their office. “The bottom line is we have to keep working,” the doctor said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010032
Jilin Lockdowns Add Stress to Residents With Medical Needs,Many parts of the province are currently under various restrictions to curb rising COVID-19 cases.,2022-03-30,"Several cities in the northeastern province of Jilin have been shut down since the beginning of March, and some residents are getting more worried about their immediate medical needs than the coronavirus itself.  Jin Huijun’s husband suffers from chronic diabetes and is running short of the medication to manage his disease. She said the type of insulin injection — which helps regulate blood sugar — used by her husband is now either difficult to get due to the lockdown or out of stock. “We have some remaining insulin shots that are only enough for one or two days, otherwise we wouldn’t be trying to get more,” the 74-year-old told Sixth Tone, adding that their son, in a different city, had posted a plea for help on the microblogging platform Weibo. “We don’t want to cause trouble for the government. But if he doesn’t receive the injection he could die.” The couple grow flowers on a farm in the outskirts of Changchun, the provincial capital of Jilin, which has been in lockdown since March 11 as the province topped the nation’s COVID-19 infections. Other cities in the province of 24 million people were locked down in the weeks that followed. As China remains adamant in maintaining a “zero-COVID” policy, locking down cities even as big as Shanghai, to stamp out every single infection, the strategy has been gradually testing people’s patience. Jilin has been reporting the most number of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases over the past weeks. On Tuesday, the province logged 1,150 of them in addition to 1,032 asymptomatic cases which China doesn’t include in its national tally. A 25-year-old, surnamed Wang, who lives in the outskirts of Changchun told Sixth Tone that he had been struggling for a week to get fresh vegetables, as the lockdown restricted people from leaving their homes. Online shops, he said, were either closed or overwhelmed with orders. Wang said more stringent controls were imposed on his entire neighborhood after health officials confirmed a single COVID-19 case there. The area was then labeled as risky and residents were required to follow stringent measures. “Everyone seems to be having a hard time,” he said, adding that while younger people were more tech-savvy and able to find solutions, the elderly were likely to be isolated and more vulnerable. Another Jilin native, surnamed Hu, currently working in the neighboring Liaoning province, agreed. He said he was concerned about his parents who live by themselves in the city of Dehui, particularly his 55-year-old father who had ostomy surgery last year. Since the surgery created an opening in his father’s abdomen to discharge urine and other bodily waste, Hu said his father has had to rely on special medical products, but struggled to find them following the lockdown. With no immediate solution in sight, Wang said workers from his parent’s residential community offered to take the couple to another hospital in a different city that may fulfill their needs. “The hospital only provides part of what we need,” he said. “The temporary plan is to look for medical supply stores near the hospital, but my friends said they’re still not open.” Online posts calling for similar medical assistance have been growing on Weibo after several cities went into full lockdown over a week ago, said Miya Zhou, a volunteer from Chengdu who works with nonprofits to help people seeking assistance online. She said people in lockdown mostly struggled with a lack of healthcare and food supplies and depended on the communities and the services they provided. “Some of the communities are good, but some are not responsive, maybe due to a lack of staff or other reasons,” Zhou told Sixth Tone. On March 11, a 4-year-old girl with acute laryngitis in Jilin reportedly died in hospital while waiting for a negative nucleic test result required for treatment. Such tragedies — also occurring most recently in Shanghai and in Xi’an — have made headlines and triggered public uproar. Authorities have usually responded to such tragedies, vowing to prevent such instances in the future. In Jilin, provincial authorities said they have strengthened public services, including allowing patients and people with special needs to be fast-tracked. On Tuesday, Changchun officials also apologized to residents for providing an “inadequate” level of public service. The following day, Jin said she got a permit from her neighborhood committee to leave their building amid the lockdown. Their neighbor even arranged a car for her to go get the remaining insulin injections for her husband. Soon after, her son posted a follow-up message on Weibo, thanking social media users who offered help. “The problem has been solved,” Jin’s son wrote. “Hope you good guys stay safe.” But not for Hu. He is still trying to seek solutions to his father’s post-surgery needs, making calls and frantically seeking information that may ease his father’s situation. ""We haven't heard any good news yet,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009999
Shanghai’s Finance Workers Hunker Down in Offices for Lockdown,Staff are ensuring the city shutdown doesn’t disrupt operations in the country’s financial hub.,2022-03-30,"Shortly after Shanghai announced a two-phase lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 on Sunday evening, hundreds of thousands of residents rushed to stock up on groceries. But some raced to the office instead, carrying a week’s worth of clothing.  Major financial companies in the city’s Pudong New Area, where the lockdown started at 5 a.m. Monday, have adopted on-site and remote working modes with 24-hour personnel stationed at core posts during the lockdown, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. Pudong’s Lujiazui financial district is home to over 6,000 Chinese and international financial institutions, as well as the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange. Authorities in China’s financial hub had previously said it couldn’t afford a large-scale shutdown. But amid mounting COVID-19 cases, the city sealed districts east of the Huangpu River, which includes Pudong New Area, from Monday through Friday, followed by the remaining areas in Shanghai from April 1 to April 5. On Wednesday, Shanghai reported another daily record of nearly 6,000 COVID-19 infections for the previous day. To avoid economic disruptions, employees at major financial institutions have been asked to work in a so-called closed-loop system, which entails living inside their work premise for a designated time. Offices were already equipped with foam mattresses and sleeping bags before the lockdown announcement due to the city’s targeted quarantine rules that lock down office buildings with people who tested positive for the virus or their close contacts. Photos circulating on social media showed employees making their beds next to their work desks. While some were seen sleeping with an eye mask, others were staring at computer screens. As soon as Shanghai announced the lockdown, the state-run Bank of Communications called in over 500 employees to the office Sunday evening, according to Xinhua. Some 56 customs officers also rushed to Waigaoqiao, one of the city’s three major port areas. Amkor Assembly & Test, a semiconductor company in Pudong’s Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, was in the middle of a shift change when the lockdown was announced around 8:30 p.m. The company quickly mobilized the off-duty workers to stay in the factory to ensure its 24-hour production went uninterrupted. “By noon (Monday), more than 2,500 employees had stayed in the factory, which can ensure over 80% of the production capacity,” Cao Chilun, the company’s president and country manager, told Xinhua. The Shanghai Stock Exchange in Pudong has also adopted closed-loop management, dispatching key staff to its “disaster recovery base” in Jinqiao and a team of 39 employees to its office in Waigaoqiao, according to Shanghai’s financial supervision bureau. It also issued 30 “business adjustment and connection arrangements” to optimize the workflow involving stock issuance and listing review and bond business services. The situation in Shanghai has evoked familiar memories for those in the financial sector in Shenzhen, another trading center in the south. The city was shut for a week earlier this month amid rising coronavirus cases. Zhang Qianshuo, a portfolio manager at a Shenzhen venture fund, told Sixth Tone that traders, especially in bond transactions — which trade with leverage and had to carry on to secure contracts — worked under closed-loop management. He said many staff volunteered to stay in the office during the lockdown and were provided with food and daily supplies. “The bond trader who covered my business stayed in her office building for a week during Shenzhen’s lockdown,” he said. “Bond trading cannot be stopped. There are many bond investing giants in Shanghai, so the influence is huge.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1010020
"The Shanghai Lockdown Rap: ‘Get Fed, Go on Get Tested’",The city’s fight to defeat COVID-19 — and to buy fresh vegetables — now has an anthem.,2022-03-29,"“Everybody’s fighting over food.” As Shanghai works through its most wide-reaching lockdowns of the pandemic, panic buying has hit many of the city’s markets. It seems like everyone is rushing out to stock up — and if they’re not, they’re probably listening to the latest dialect rap about it. Called “Grocery Shopping” (Mai Cai), it is the work of three local rappers who told Sixth Tone they were hoping to bring some good humor to a stressful situation. Rich with local slang and performed in Shanghainese, it includes jokes about panic buying, lining up for COVID tests, and gentle urging to follow the rules. Composed and performed by CATI2, P.J, and Keyso, the song was released on the music streaming platform Netease Cloud Music shortly after the city announced its two-phase lockdown plan on Sunday evening. Areas east of the Huangpu River will be entirely shut down until early Friday morning, followed by the rest of the city from April 1 to April 5.  With the song attached, a WeChat article titled “After Three Shanghai Rappers Survived Quarantine, It Turns Out…” was viewed over 100,000 times within two hours. It’s got people humming the hook, and quoting it on social media: “get food, go on get tested.” “This song tells it as it is for the people of Shanghai. Everybody is playing it on loop,” a user on the Twitter-like platform Weibo wrote. The next day, even the elderly were playing these songs on their phone to kill time when in long queues at the grocery store checkouts, Jin Lin, a resident living in Xuhui District, told Sixth Tone. Speaking with Sixth Tone by phone, P.J, one of the creators, talks about the making of “Grocery Shopping” and the rap culture in Shanghai. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.   Sixth Tone: How did the three of you get together to create the song? P.J: We have all been locked down in our apartment complexes over the past week, and we got very bored at home. CATI2 had a vague idea for the project on Saturday, and came to me and Keyso. Thinking it was an excellent idea to use music to cheer up the people of Shanghai and dispel the negative atmosphere online, the three of us got started immediately. On Sunday, CATI2 sent us a simple melody and a hook he wrote, asking Keyso and me to work from there. We wrote the lyrics based on our own experiences and observations over the past few days, recorded our own parts, and then put them all together. The whole process only took around three hours. In my part, I describe escaping from one lockdown but getting trapped in another. Last week I was told my apartment in Changning District would be locked down at midnight. I packed my bags and ran to my parents’ apartment in Pudong District. However, just as my own apartment got unsealed, I got locked down at my parents’ place. We chose buying vegetables as the theme, because it is the challenge that sums this outbreak up the most. I’ve been to the supermarket to stock up on food many times, and each time I saw people pick the shelves clean. It was even worse than when they buy up groceries before New Year. Many times, there were no carts and I had to hold everything in my hands, dropping stuff everywhere as I walked around. That never happened to me before. Sixth Tone: Why did you use dialect to compose this song? Has Shanghai always had a Shanghainese rap culture? P.J: We started to create some songs in Shanghainese around 2014, but because it’s a dialect, these songs’ reach is limited. However, we were not making a musical piece this time but doing something to encourage people in Shanghai. It’s a natural decision to use Shanghainese. Shanghai had “speak-singing” (shuochang) as a folk genre since the ’50s but it does not have any roots in Western culture like today’s Shanghai rap. In the 2000s, Shanghai artist Huang Yongsheng’s “Jinling Pagoda” was a national hit. Many people say our music is not as good as the older generation of speak-singing, but we still want to do our best to build a style of our own. In the past few years, rap in Sichuan and Chongqing has taken off, as shown when the most successful rapper GAI got famous on TV in The Rap of China, a rap talent show. Since then, rappers across China have started to use dialect rap to represent their region. Whenever we come across an opportunity, we will do the same.  Sixth Tone: How did you get into rap? I started doing rap in high school, learning from a school mate who memorized ancient poems by rapping about them. I tried it myself. I kept recording songs based on ancient poems and found it to be a really good way to memorize things for tests. I started creating real rap songs with a friend in college and posting them to various platforms. But I never became a professional musician. After college, I’ve always had a regular day job and now I’m a sports teacher at a middle school. I participated in some rap contests, but I never had a hit. Now I’m using my spare time to run an escape room, and I am trying to blend hip-hop culture into a cartoon franchise called The Debbies. Sixth Tone: Are there other projects about COVID-19 that you would like to pursue? P.J: We will write a victory song after the lockdown gets lifted, a tribute to our medical staff and volunteers. The Debbies will also launch a series of “blind boxes,” showcasing the character Debbie in different outfits, with one in a hazmat suit.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009994
Shanghai’s Older Residents Lament Over Lockdown Woes,The city’s elderly say they face difficulties from navigating technological requirements to accessing medical services amid COVID-19 outbreak.,2022-03-29,"As Shanghai divided the city into half for a two-phase lockdown Monday, the city’s older residents have complained about a range of problems from difficulties in adapting to modern technology to keeping up with pandemic-related measures as well as ordering everyday supplies and securing their medical needs.  A resident surnamed Xiao from the Pudong New Area, which is currently in lockdown, said her 63-year-old father is an esophageal cancer patient who undergoes immunotherapy once every three weeks at a hospital on the other side of the city. They had already waited for seven days before the lockdown was announced Sunday night for the appointment and now would need to wait for at least another eight days. “Despite my father being in a consolidation therapy period, we don’t know if the half-month delay will have any impact,” Xiao told Sixth Tone. “We’re not sure whether the treatment will resume on April 5 when the lockdown is scheduled to be lifted.” Shanghai locked down districts east of the Huangpu River, which crisscrosses the city, from Monday through Friday, and will shut the remaining parts from April 1 to 5. Authorities said the move would allow them to test the city’s population of nearly 25 million , as the city reported another daily record of 4,477 infections for Monday. Authorities have been scrambling to erect makeshift hospitals and turn public venues into quarantine facilities to house the sick. But those living with other health ailments, especially older people, have added pressures to the city’s health care system — those aged 60 and above accounted for 36% of its total population with household registration as of December 2020. Another Pudong resident, surnamed Lu, told Sixth Tone that her 68-year-old grandmother is a uremic patient, and she requires hemodialysis treatment to clean her blood three times a week. But at least a dozen hospitals rejected her on Monday, citing COVID-19 cases in their community and a shortage of medical resources. The day the lockdown started in nearly half of Shanghai, a personal online post shared with Sixth Tone highlighted the plight of one family seeking medical treatment for its older members. It spoke of a grandson who ultimately sought help from the police to pass medicines bought from areas currently not in lockdown for his grandparents, both aged over 90, who lived by themselves in Pudong. Many senior residents living by themselves have often complained of difficulties adapting to technology during the lockdowns. A video of an elderly resident in Changchun, another locked down city in the northeastern Jilin province, asking a supermarket employee how to buy groceries online went viral online lately. As of December 2021, about 11.5% of the country’s over 1 billion internet users were aged 60 and above. Authorities have urged internet companies to provide senior-friendly versions of their services, though more settings need to be improved. A 65-year-old resident, surnamed Zhou, who lives alone in Shanghai’s Changning District, said she was struggling to keep up with ordering groceries online. She said it took her over 20 minutes to secure deliveries for a friend on Monday. “My hands were sore and I was sweating,” Zhou said, adding she tried to replenish her stock through online shops later that day but failed. “The price of vegetables has increased three times. But you are the lucky one if you can buy vegetables,” said another resident, Zhang Meixiu, who lives with her son in Minhang District. The 64-year-old said she was exasperated checking her phone all day long to order food and necessities. A volunteer resident, surnamed Wang, has been assisting residents during mass testing for COVID-19 in one of Pudong’s residential neighborhoods. She said her main task mostly involved helping the older residents register online through their smartphone or manually. “Older people aged 70 or 80 and above mostly don’t have smartphones, so we print out a QR code for them using their ID cards,” said the 40-year-old. “They keep saying, ‘I’m too old to figure this out, thank you.’” Shanghai authorities said on Monday that they have ensured communities and volunteers care for the elderly, especially those living alone, ensuring their meals and medical needs during the lockdowns. They also require medical institutions and communities to meet emergency medical needs of residents, especially pregnant women and patients seeking hemodialysis, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009998
"One City, Two Lockdowns: Shanghai Faces Its Toughest COVID-19 Test","After dismissing lockdown possibilities, the city adapts to the country’s pandemic control playbook to mass test its nearly 25 million residents.",2022-03-28,"SHANGHAI — At around 10 p.m. Sunday, Zhao Yuanqi rushed to her nearest grocery store just like thousands of others in the Pudong New Area to pick up whatever remained on the shelves. Across the river, in Xuhui District, Lin Meng was finishing her daily yoga session at approximately the same time, and spent a stress-free evening before retiring to bed. Both women live in Shanghai, but how they spent their Sunday evening provides a peek into how the city is fine-tuning tactics to fight its worst COVID-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic two years ago. Just after dinner time for many on Sunday, at around 8:30 p.m., the Shanghai government announced that they would enforce a lockdown in two phases. Areas east of the Huangpu River would be entirely locked down from 5 a.m. Monday until the same time Friday, while the other parts of the city with several downtown districts would be sealed between April 1 and 5. It was a surprise move — though not entirely unexpected — after the city government time and again quelled rumors about such lockdowns amid mounting coronavirus cases. Police even detained two men for starting such rumors last week. Citywide lockdowns started as a key virus-control measure since the early days of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, and have been effectively implemented in several cities including the cities of Xi’an, Shenzhen, and those in Jilin province most recently. But health experts and some officials said as recently as Saturday that such moves could prove costly for a city like Shanghai, a city of nearly 25 million people and the country’s financial hub. But the city adopted part of the central government’s playbook, announcing a two-phase lockdown to test its entire population and eliminate any possible chain of COVID-19 transmission. On Monday, Shanghai logged another daily record of 3,500 infections for the previous day — also the most cases nationally — which have put a strain on the city’s health care system. During the lockdowns, residents will be barred from leaving their homes. Public transport and ride-hailing services will be suspended, and only those in public services and essential services such as health care and food delivery would be allowed to move around. Companies and factories have either suspended manufacturing or allowed their employees to work remotely. “It was such a panic,” 28-year-old Zhao in Pudong recalled the scene after the government’s announcement Sunday. “Everyone just put whatever they could get in their bags and the line at the cashier was unbearable.” She gave up and went home. Many in the city’s locked down districts including Pudong — home to one of China’s busiest international airports and ports which authorities noted would operate as normal — said they were caught off guard by the government’s announcement, giving them little time to plan. Hundreds of thousands of residents there were already in lockdown, as officials sealed buildings with infected individuals or their close contacts. “I was worried that I might get infected in such a group of people, and I couldn’t sleep well last night,” Zhao said. But while half of Shanghai was in panic mode and stressed, those west of the Huangpu River crisscrossing the city — home to several downtown districts — scrolled online to gauge the situation and possibly what to expect. Some residents like 33-year-old Lin only woke up to the news Monday after she couldn’t order breakfast on food delivery apps due to overwhelming demand. “I wasn’t concerned about food though,” Lin told Sixth Tone. “I’m really worried about my mother who always volunteers to help residents in the compound. I’m anxious about what would happen if she got infected.” Those anxieties and uncertainties have already appeared online, just hours into the lockdown. In the non-locked down districts, reactions have been mixed — many shops were operating normally and there weren’t any signs of panic buying yet. A worker at a logistics company, surnamed Li, lives west of the Huangpu River in Baoshan District. The 23-year-old said she had stocked food and daily supplies, which were still in abundance in her neighborhood, and was hoping for the government to announce the lockdown due to rising COVID-19 infections. “I commute by subway and bus every day, and I’m very worried that I would get infected,” Li told Sixth Tone. “All I want now is the promised lockdown from April 1 because I really need a rest from work and a sense of security.” But some residents are growing anxious over the lockdown, especially those requiring medical assistance. Last week, a hospital apologized for not being able to admit one of their nurses after an asthma attack. She was referred to another facility and later died after not receiving immediate medical attention. A college student, surnamed Wang, in Pudong New Area said he was asked to do COVID-19 test amid excruciating stomach pain Saturday, just so he could visit a hospital. Most medical facilities require patients to show proof of a negative test for the virus taken within the past 48 hours for non-emergency services. He then called the hospital for an appointment only to find they had nine COVID-19 patients. The voice on the other end of the line told Wang they wouldn’t accept him even though he had a valid negative report and instead told him to look for another hospital. Disappointed and horrified, Wang decided to schedule an online appointment with a doctor who then prescribed him medication for enteritis, an inflammation of the small intestine. “All I can say is that thank God it wasn’t an emergency case or I could have died,” Wang said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009993
Half of Shanghai Rushes Into Lockdown With Unease and Uncertainty,The city reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases as officials strengthened relatively lenient virus-control measures.,2022-03-28,"Hours before nearly half of Shanghai entered a COVID-19 lockdown just before dawn on Monday, millions of surprised residents scrambled to prepare for the days ahead. At around 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, authorities had announced the city would be locked down in two phases to test around 25 million people who live in Shanghai. Areas east of the Huangpu River, which includes the financial Pudong New Area, would be entirely sealed until early Friday morning, followed by the remaining areas from April 1 to April 5. Residents would be prohibited to leave their homes and all businesses and transport suspended during the lockdowns. The decision came swiftly considering the city government had repeatedly dismissed a citywide lockdown in Shanghai as it battled its worst coronavirus outbreak yet. The morning the lockdown was enforced, the city announced a record 3,500 infections for the previous day. At the Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital in Pudong New Area, Zhang Lanlan and her husband also had a quick decision to make. She had just given birth on Wednesday and was given an option of either leaving before the lockdown kicked in at 5 a.m. or spending another five days at the hospital. “I hadn’t expected this — the pandemic has interrupted all my plans,” she told Sixth Tone, adding both her parents and in-laws were already in lockdown for the past two weeks. Authorities started sealing buildings that contain people who have COVID or their close contacts since the beginning of March. After considering multiple scenarios, including moving to their apartment and frantic phone calls to confirm their residential community’s policies, the couple decided to stay put — even if that meant spending an extra 10,000 yuan ($1,570). It was already midnight then. “I’m already lucky compared with those who are expecting their babies in the next couple of days — they have to deal with uncertainties and worries,” the Pudong native said. “Some have chosen to check into hotels or maternity care centers to avoid being locked down in their own neighborhoods.” Cai Jiaoqian was planning to end her day at 10:30 p.m. when messages flooded her messaging app WeChat. The 26-year-old fruit vendor has been delivering groceries and other daily supplies as well since the targeted residential lockdowns started early this month. “I received hundreds of orders from nearby residents last night after the phased lockdown was announced,” she told Sixth Tone. “I was taking notes from the WeChat messages and told the clients I would try to deliver tomorrow. But many responded they’re afraid I won’t be able to work the next day.” Video footage of residents crowding supermarkets, with many of them opening late, ahead of the lockdown have been widely shared on social media. “I felt they were panicking,” she said. “They’re afraid of running out of daily necessities to pull through the next few days. So I made a decision to keep working.” Authorities have ensured that they would monitor food supplies and price hikes, and would allow essential workers, including delivery drivers, to move around. Cai, who has been taking initiative on her own, isn’t a delivery worker by definition but plans to help nevertheless. She finished delivering over 300 orders by 6 a.m. Monday and then took a two-hour nap, before scrolling through the messages on her phone again. “I can’t promise anything at the moment because I don’t have much stock left,” Cai said. “And I’m not sure when my supplies will arrive. But I’ll do whatever I can.” However, not everyone has been able to order their daily groceries online — not because of lack of supplies but limited skills. Many older residents like 79-year-old Li Xinhua said they were worried over the uncertainties. He only found out about the lockdown after waking up Monday, though his residential building was already sealed for two weeks over half a dozen COVID-19 infections in the neighborhood of 5,000 residents. “I had no idea of the phased lockdown and I was not even aware that my close neighbors in the same building were confirmed positive cases three days ago,” he told Sixth Tone. “I was leaving the building to throw away garbage and pick up the vegetables my daughter bought for us. I could have been exposed to the (virus).” Li owns a smartphone but only has limited ability to use the device. He has been seeking help from the neighborhood committee from registering online for the nucleic acid tests to navigating the technological aspects associated with the country’s virus control measures. “But now the neighborhood committee staff have all been identified as close contacts of a positive case,” he said. “They’ve all been locked down in their office. Who else can I turn to?”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009992
"With Fresh Urgency, China Pleads With Seniors to Get Vaccinated",Chinese vaccines have been proven safe and effective. But older citizens remain reluctant despite a surge of Omicron cases.,2022-03-25,"In one city, health officials are going door-to-door to reach people with limited mobility. In another, vaccination sites are being opened closer to communities with many older adults. All over the country, public announcements call on seniors to reconsider their hesitancy. “All senior citizens, take action immediately and proactively answer the call to get vaccinated,” the health authorities of Tongzhou, a district in the eastern city Nantong, said in an open letter that was published along posters of smiling grandparents with their sleeves rolled up. As China’s health care system is at risk of being overwhelmed by the country’s worst COVID-19 wave since the initial outbreak, with more than 40,000 infections over the past month, older people have become the focus of a renewed inoculation campaign. Though seniors are most at risk of serious symptoms and death after an infection, their vaccination rate lags that of other age groups. While nearly 88% of all Chinese people are vaccinated, some 52 million people aged 60 and above have yet to complete a two-dose regimen. In particular, about half of people over 80 years old have not been fully vaccinated. Unlike many other countries, China’s initial vaccination campaign prioritized not the most vulnerable age groups but working-age people. China’s domestically produced vaccines had not been trialed on a sufficient number of older people, resulting in little data on their efficacy and side-effects for this age group. Though later research did prove the vaccine was safe and effective for people over the age of 60 and vaccine eligibility was expanded, the oldest people had to wait the longest. Shanghai didn’t make vaccines available to residents over 75 years old until mid-2021. This approach seems to have convinced many older Chinese that side effects remain an issue. In the capital Beijing, only 40% of senior care home residents have received their first COVID-19 shot. By comparison, about 83% of all nursing home residents in the U.S. are vaccinated. “Vaccination can provide good protection against severe illness and death,” Liang Wannian, the head of China’s COVID response expert team, said during a press conference Tuesday. “Completing the vaccine series and getting a booster shot are especially significant for the elderly.” The Chinese government began to more strongly push for seniors to get their COVID-19 shot after an earlier Omicron wave in Hong Kong showed the risk posed by a poorly vaccinated older population. In the city, some 5,000 mostly unvaccinated older adults died during the outbreak, showing that Omicron, though milder, is still deadly for people with no immunity. The COVID-19 vaccines available in Hong Kong include both the China-made inactive vaccine, Sinovac, and the mRNA vaccine made by Germany’s BioNTech. About two-thirds of people over the age of 80 who were vaccinated received the former. While the mRNA vaccine has been shown to be more effective, the Hong Kong government said on Sunday that Sinovac still significantly lowered the death rate. China’s renewed push might be too late to have much of an effect during the current outbreak, health experts told Sixth Tone. Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, U.S., said in a previous interview that the two-dose vaccine series requires about a month to complete, and it would need another week for the protection to kick in. Vaccine hesitancy could also limit the current campaign’s effectiveness. Older people Sixth Tone spoke with expressed concerns over side effects, especially whether they could worsen their existing health conditions. “I feel really conflicted about whether to get the shot,” said a 63-year-old woman surnamed Xu who lives in Zhoukou county, in central China’s Henan Province. “I have coronary artery disease and hypertension, so I don’t know what the vaccine would do to my health.” Xu told Sixth Tone that community workers had visited her home last summer to convince her to get vaccinated. But when she told them her concerns, the community workers became hesitant too. “Every time I think about it (getting vaccinated), I get this tightness in my chest. I feel awful,” she said. “So far, there’s no outbreak in my area,” said Xu, who, like other interviewees, did not want to use her full name when discussing private health matters. “But if one day the virus comes, I guess I’ll have to summon up my courage to do it.” According to China’s COVID-19 vaccination guidelines, people with chronic disease are recommended to get vaccinated if their condition is stable. But a 63-year-old woman surnamed Zhang told Sixth Tone that even her doctor couldn’t give her a firm answer on whether she can safely get vaccinated. Zhang had lung surgery four years ago. “Over the past years, I worked so hard to maintain my health,” she said. “I eat a very balanced diet, and I’m always very careful when I go outside. It’d be very upsetting if the vaccine ruins it.” Zhang lives in the northeastern city of Shenyang, in Liaoning Province. Shenyang has recorded over 300 infections since early March, and the city has suspended public transport in a bid to limit the virus’ spread. Zhang knows she’s vulnerable to COVID-19 because of her age and health condition and the active outbreak in her city, she said. “I feel like I should just get the shot, but I really don’t know.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009983
"Locals Detained for Avoiding Virus Tests, Flouting COVID-19 Rules",Authorities have expanded the list of “illegal activities” to include tampering with pandemic control measures amid a surge in coronavirus infections.,2022-03-24,"Chinese cities are conducting mandatory mass COVID-19 testing to combat a growing outbreak — and opting out from such screenings could land residents in detention. On Monday, a woman in Quanzhou was detained for five days after repeatedly avoiding nucleic acid tests in her residential community from March 14 to 20, according to a local newspaper. The city in the eastern province of Fujian carried out multiple rounds of mass testing after logging 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 13. China pursues a “zero COVID” strategy and the country has adopted several measures, including mass testing and lockdowns, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. This means anyone violating local and national epidemic control measures is subject to punishments, including detention and arrest. In the past months, residents have been detained for hiding their travel history, spreading rumors related to COVID-19, secretly fleeing from areas in lockdown, and insulting epidemic prevention personnel. But it wasn’t until recently that rejecting nucleic acid tests was also added to a list of “illegal behaviors.” On Sunday, two men in Shenzhen – the southern tech hub that lifted a lockdown earlier this week — were detained after one took a nucleic acid test for the other, according to media reports. Several people in multiple cities have also been detained or arrested for flouting virus control rules. They include two bar owners in the eastern city of Jinhua and a massage parlor owner in the northern municipality of Tianjin for secretly operating businesses in prohibited areas. In the northwestern city of Xi’an — which lifted its lockdown two months ago after containing an outbreak — police detained seven people for letting in customers at restaurants and commercial buildings without registering them. All those buildings were located in areas with COVID-19 infections, local police said Tuesday. A couple who ran a roast duck restaurant in Beijing were also being investigated for flouting COVID-19 protocols, police said Sunday. They found that 477 of the 830 people who dined at the restaurant between March 10 and 15 hadn’t scanned their mobile health code to register their personal details. Authorities later found that one of those diners, who later tested positive for the coronavirus, had infected 11 others, according to domestic media. Beijing police said they had handled 104 “illegal cases” related to COVID-19 since March 7. Meanwhile, Shanghai police on Wednesday opened an investigation into two men for allegedly spreading rumors that the city would be locked down. A man in the coastal city of Qingdao was also detained this month on similar charges.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009978
Shanghai’s Lifeline Amid COVID-19: Delivery Workers and Volunteers,"As many parts of the city are still under lockdown, residents join frontline workers to help the city battle the coronavirus outbreak.",2022-03-23,"SHANGHAI — As hundreds of thousands of residents in Shanghai are placed in concentrated community lockdowns as the city battles its worst COVID-19 outbreak, an army of volunteer groups and delivery drivers have been out in the streets providing basic services and daily supplies. Zhao Lei, from the Qingai Clinical nonprofit organization, volunteered to join a local medical team during mass coronavirus testing given her experience in handling health care-related tasks. As of Wednesday, she said she had conducted nucleic acid testing on over 1,800 people. “This is the first time I've worn protective gear,” she told Sixth Tone. “The most uncomfortable thing is that the protective glasses keep fogging up. I can’t see clearly and have to rely on my feelings to control how deep the swab goes.”  Shanghai is experiencing its worst COVID-19 outbreak, with hundreds of cases being logged daily. Since the first case was detected on March 1, the city had reported over 4,000 infections as of Tuesday. Unlike other smaller cities, the city of over 24 million people has so far refrained from a citywide lockdown and quelled such online rumors Tuesday. Shanghai has instead adopted a “grid system,” locking down and screening residential communities and other facilities where infected individuals and their close contacts may have lived, worked, or visited. Lin Zhuoying, a community volunteer at Ruihong New Town in Hongkou District, has led a team of over 30 volunteers to assist community workers coordinate testing, sort out piled-up deliveries, patrol the neighborhood, and remind residents to wear masks. “As residents’ daily routines get disrupted, it is easy for them to feel upset about the community’s management,” Lin said. “As long as the new operating system is well sorted out, it’s possible to bring out the righteousness and kindness in the neighborhood.” The community also came together to help the non-residents stuck inside, with some residents donating quilts and food, and even offering accommodation. “What touched me the most is that some trapped couriers joined our volunteer group and helped with carrying delivery packages,” Lin said. The city’s thousands of delivery drivers have also become a crucial workforce in helping residents during a critical time. Loaded with daily food and other supplies, they’re seen racing in Shanghai’s streets now devoid of traffic. Online grocers such as Dingdong Maicai said their orders have doubled in recent days but are facing logistical challenges with many staff getting locked down in their apartments. The company hired 300 additional staff and drivers across the city, Agence France-Presse reported Saturday. Zhang Zhicheng, a delivery driver from the southwestern province of Sichuan, told Sixth Tone that his job was rewarding despite the overwhelming demand. “I am not just working for money now,” he said. “I feel the city needs me. My customers all express great gratitude to me.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009959
How Omicron Is Challenging China’s Grip on COVID-19,A low vaccination rate among older Chinese is complicating the response to the current outbreak.,2022-03-18,"Two years into its aggressive and mostly successful attempt to keep the COVID-19 pandemic at bay, China has begun tweaking its approach as it faces its biggest wave of infections since the first outbreak. Fueled by Omicron and its even more rapidly spreading BA.2 subvariant, China’s current COVID-19 outbreak involves over 20,000 cases in 20 province-level areas around the country. Public health experts tell Sixth Tone that the Chinese government now faces a conundrum: Maintain its strict “zero-COVID” policy that involves rigorous contact tracing and mass quarantining, but incur a steep economic cost due to the sheer number of cases; or loosen the reins but expose the country’s older adults, whose vaccination rates are relatively low, to heightened health risks. The country’s health authorities are trying to find a middle path, recently introducing two changes to its handling of the virus. People experiencing mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, which are more commonly the result of the Omicron variant compared to earlier variants, will be centrally quarantined instead of being admitted to hospital, the National Health Commission announced Wednesday. Huang Yanzhong, a China health policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, says this change aims to free up medical resources. Many patients have mild symptoms, and healthcare workers, facilities, and medicines are better allocated elsewhere. “A major problem with the zero-COVID strategy is that it doesn’t differentiate patients,” he says. “What needs to be done is prioritize those who are really in need.” Earlier, on March 10, the country’s health authorities for the first time allowed the private use of self-test kits, more than a year after Chinese companies began manufacturing them for export. People who use a self-test kit and find out they have been infected are called on to report the result, though no enforcement mechanism was specified. Previously, only testing at hospitals and designated facilities was allowed, but the demand for laboratory-based tests is currently too big. Self-test kits yield results in minutes and have the added benefit of avoiding possible infections as people line up for mass testing, says Lu Hongzhou, the director of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital. The southern metropolis recently went into a citywide lockdown due to a surge in Omicron cases. China’s strategy for the pandemic has been to use strict measures so as to buy time for developing and administering vaccines. Though it has been effective so far in avoiding the enormous caseloads of other countries, the emergence of highly contagious virus variants that even the most effective COVID-19 vaccines fail to stop has led scientists across the globe to conclude that herd immunity is no longer achievable. “A virus like Omicron is simply unstoppable,” says Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona. A zero-tolerance approach can work when a pathogen leads to obvious symptoms, he explains. But with Omicron, many people whose symptoms are minor are spreading the virus without knowing they have been infected. “It makes stopping the spread of the disease extremely hard,” Wang says. Before Omicron hit, Chinese health authorities appeared to have been looking for ways to loosen their restrictions, with top officials and prominent public health experts speaking openly about coexisting with the virus. “Most virologists in the world now recognize that COVID-19 is an endemic virus and the world has to learn to live with this virus,” Zhang Wenhong, the infectious diseases expert tasked with managing Shanghai’s coronavirus response, wrote on social media last July. In the future, China would choose an approach that would allow borders to reopen and normal life to return, he wrote. Such messages were interpreted as signs that China might roll back some of its strict COVID-19 prevention measures, says Huang. “I had thought that after experimenting with the Beijing Winter Olympics, the authorities would gradually move to relax its rules. But the Omicron outbreak in Hong Kong certainly scared them off.” Hong Kong, whose border with the mainland has remained mostly closed during the pandemic, started to see a major uptick in cases in February. Since then, the coronavirus has infected hundreds of thousands of people and killed over 3,000 people. The surge in patients overwhelmed the city’s hospitals, leaving many waiting for treatment out on the sidewalk. Hong Kong’s mounting death toll is largely the result of low vaccine uptake among older people, to whom COVID-19 poses a bigger health risk. According to official data, people aged 80 and above account for about 70% of the city’s fatalities. The Chinese mainland faces a similar dilemma. Over 88% of the country’s 1.4 billion people are fully vaccinated. But half of all people aged 80 and above — some 17 million people — are not. “China’s strict zero-COVID strategy worked so well, so many people didn’t feel the need to get vaccinated,” Wang tells Sixth Tone. “People thought the risk of getting infected is so low, then why bother dealing with the side effects of vaccines? Even my own parents were hesitant to get the shots,” he adds. Unlike the vaccination strategy of many Western countries, China was slow in vaccinating its older citizens. For months after COVID-19 shots became available, only people between the ages of 18 to 59 were eligible for vaccination, partly due to a lack of clinical trial data from older adults. “Protecting the most vulnerable people should have been prioritized,” Wang says. “Now the virus is everywhere, any attempt to boost vaccine uptake now would be too late.” Using resources wisely could lower the cost of opening up, Wang says. “With fewer people needing to go to the hospital for testing and treatment, we can reserve vital resources for (older people).” New medicines also help, he adds. In December, China approved the country’s first drug designed specifically to treat COVID-19. The company behind the monoclonal antibody treatment says it reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by 78% if administered early enough. Last month, the country’s drug authority also approved Paxlovid, a COVID-19 antiviral pill designed by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The orally administered drug has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 89% if taken soon after the onset of symptoms. “Zero-COVID was achieved at the cost of many people’s livelihoods and being disconnected from the rest of the world,” Wang says. “With a sluggish economy, I don’t know how much more resources China has to burn in a bid to reach this impossible goal. We are no longer helpless facing COVID-19, so our strategy needs a change.” Correction: A previous version of this article said testing for COVID-19 was only allowed at hospitals. It was also allowed at certain designated facilities.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009927
Photos: Shanghai During Spring in the Shadow of COVID-19,Sixth Tone photographers capture the city’s mood amid its worst virus outbreak.,2022-03-18,"SHANGHAI — Shanghai’s spring blossoms aren’t receiving the usual attention this year. Many of the city’s parks and botanical gardens, where the city’s vibrant peach, plum, and magnolia blooms can usually be seen, have been shut due to a rise in COVID-19 cases. Sports and entertainment venues have also been closed. Hundreds of thousands of Shanghai residents — including over 100,000 university students — are temporarily locked down, too. Some of the city’s vibrant streets are nearly deserted, with malls and metros noticing a sharp drop in shoppers and commuters, respectively. But a lone dancer in the park, a solo diner at a restaurant, and couples finding a quiet space in the otherwise crowded Bund waterfront still encapsulate the city’s spirit, albeit in a different way. Sixth Tone photographers wandered around the city of over 24 million people over the past few days to document springtime in the shadow of the COVID-19 surge.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009919
How Four Chinese Cities Are Responding as Case Counts Rise,"The hardest-hit cities are in full lockdown. Shanghai and Shenzhen, with under 10 cases per 100,000, are not far off.",2022-03-17,"On March 16, China added 1,226 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,206 asymptomatic infections. They’re part of the country’s biggest outbreak since the first wave in 2020, and local governments are scrambling to contain the spread. So far, the outbreak has reached many parts of the country, including the northeastern Jilin and Liaoning provinces, the northern Hebei province, and eastern provinces including Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, as well as Shanghai. National guidelines published by the National Health Commission provide a rough playbook for containment, but each city is making its own calls about when to impose different measures. Sixth Tone selected four of the hardest-hit cities to compare prevention measures. With the majority of the country’s cases, Jilin province shut things down fast. The province’s Jilin City, which had 115 cases per 100,000 people as of March 15, issued nine citywide quarantine measures on March 6 and 7. It also conducted eight rounds of nucleic acid testing on all the citizens over 13 days. But its case numbers are still exploding, hitting 4,472 on March 15. Jilin’s provincial capital Changchun is also battling a major outbreak. From March 11 to 12, daily confirmed cases soared from 63 to 831. On March 11, the city required all residents to stay home, work online, and undergo daily nucleic acid testing. On March 14, Changchun announced a citywide lockdown. The larger cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, which have only 0.4 and 4 cases per 100,000, have taken a more flexible approach. Shanghai shut down a large number of parks and other public places starting March 5. Much of the city’s population is currently being kept at home for testing as part of what the government calls its “key areas” approach, but some shops and residential areas remain open. The outbreak in Shenzhen began earlier, in mid-February. Its response also provided an example for other cities as to how to balance the needs of everyday life with COVID-19 over a long period of time. Shenzhen’s preliminary measures have been based on the strict delineation of infected areas, with different zones defined by their perceived risk each being put under different forms of quarantine. As of now, confirmed cases in the four cities are still rising. Only time will tell whether the current measures succeed in curbing the outbreak. As more data comes in, Sixth Tone will update these charts to illustrate how cities respond — and what effect the measures have.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009916
One Hundred Thousand Students Likely Locked Down in Shanghai,"As the city battles an outbreak of COVID-19, at least 18 colleges and universities have confined students to campuses.",2022-03-16,"SHANGHAI — On Monday noon, students at Fudan University crossed campus in single file, walking to lunch between rows of monitors. They had an hour to pick up food and get back to their dorms. When the students crossed a road, volunteers held up isolation lines to guide students, each with a lunch box in hand. Security guards occasionally called out, “put your phone down!” Except for three trips a day to pick up food, Fudan’s students are stuck in their rooms, taking online classes, playing board games, and chatting with roommates while waiting out a tentative 14-day campus quarantine. The renowned university is adopting what it calls “bubble management,” as Shanghai has put at least 18 local universities and colleges in lockdown, mostly over the weekend, in citywide efforts to curb its worst COVID-19 outbreak since early 2020. With larger schools home to tens of thousands of students at a time, the lockdown likely affects well over 100,000 students. Students and staff at universities and colleges, including Fudan University, Tongji University, and East China Normal University, have been banned from leaving campuses while the schools conduct mass nucleic acid tests. Shanghai, which contains over 60 universities and colleges, recorded five “confirmed,” or symptomatic, cases and 197 asymptomatic cases on Tuesday, bringing total local infections this month to over 1,000. The megacity currently has declared nine “medium-risk area” hotspots. The Shanghai International Studies University was one of the first campuses to lock down in early March. It’s done at least seven rounds of mass testing so far. Students confined to their dormitories organized sing-alongs — first on dorm balconies, then in a virtual karaoke room in an app due to virus prevention concerns. Zhao Yao, a doctoral student at the university’s Institute of Linguistics, told Sixth Tone that over 200 students, mainly at graduate schools, sang and listened to each other online for about two hours on Monday night. “It’s been a long time since I sang. After I entered the online room, I had to wait for others to sing first, just like what we do offline,” said Zhao. “I played what other students sang the rest of time as background music… the energy of music provides relief and entertainment during the outbreak.” At least 33 infections were detected in Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Minhang District campus as of Tuesday, making it the hardest-hit campus in the city. Students there were banned from exiting the campus on March 9, and have been prohibited from leaving their dormitories since Saturday. Before the lockdown, students at Jiao Tong could freely enter and leave the campus with a digital pass, amid sporadic COVID-19 flare-ups. Several students at the Minhang campus told Sixth Tone they were caught off guard. “The lockdown came all of a sudden last Wednesday morning,” said Chen Jiaxin, a 21-year-old junior student majoring in business. “I was anxious at first, and frequently checked our school forum and an online document created by fellow students for updates.” Lin Jiayi, a graduate student who used a pseudonym for privacy, said she was panicked to see almost all instant noodles, cookies, and bread were sold out at convenience stores on the campus last Wednesday morning. “We did not have enough mental preparation, as well as enough time to stock up resources,” Lin said. Students are allowed to receive parcels, but not food delivery. Xu Zi’ang, a 19-year-old sophomore at the School of Mechanical Engineering, served as a student volunteer in the initial days of campus lockdown, helping maintain order at testing sites and prepare supplies for students. “The situation soon got worse than we expected, with more cases and close contacts detected among students,” said Xu. He was identified as a close contact of a confirmed case on Saturday and is currently in a quarantine hotel. “I can’t believe the outbreak is so close to me.” Over 30,000 students at the Minhang campus have been sealed inside their dormitories since Saturday. Faculty and staff have volunteered to deliver necessities like food and water to the dorms. Some students described a shortage of manpower on the first day of the complete lockdown. Xu said his roommates received dinner at around 10 p.m. on Saturday, though the delivery of meals was on time in the following days. After Lin’s roommate came down with a fever, Lin was taken to a classroom to wait for nucleic acid testing on Sunday afternoon. The results turned out negative Monday night, after she spent over 24 hours waiting anxiously. “The school provided a mattress and quilt, and I laid them down at the front of the classroom. I couldn’t fall asleep for the whole night,” said Lin. Meanwhile, in dormitory buildings where cases were reported, students are requested to stay inside their room, with a few student volunteers on each floor distributing packed lunches, water, and Lianhua Qingwen Granules, a Chinese medicine used as a treatment for COVID-19. “A lot of changes have taken place these days,” said Xu Yunshu, a 20-year-old junior student who serves as a volunteer. “Every day we hear sirens, and we have gotten used to it… Some students who are suspected to be COVID-positive after batch tests are quarantined in hotels outside campus.” “I haven’t showered for about six days because we have only a shared bathroom,” said Lin. “I just hope our campus can detect no cases, and we can take a bath soon.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009890
Offices Adapt to COVID-19 Rules; Factories and Delivery Sector Can’t,"As white-collar workers pivot to remote work smoothly in Shanghai and Shenzhen, many blue-collar workers want to return to in-person jobs.",2022-03-16,"As China contends with its largest COVID-19 outbreak since the first wave in 2020, the megacities of Shanghai and Shenzhen have imposed their toughest restrictions in two years. The wide adoption of remote office software has helped white-collar workers and officers brush off widespread COVID-19 shutdowns, but the service and manufacturing industries, and their workers, have been hit hard. Since Monday, most foreign companies in Shanghai required their staff to work from home, and state-owned enterprises asked workers to alternate shifts in the office, according to over a dozen residents Sixth Tone spoke to. Apartment complexes across the city will undergo 48-hour lockdowns for preventative testing on Thursday and Friday, in addition to many that are locked down following the detection of cases and close contacts. Meanwhile, in Shenzhen, where a COVID-19 outbreak has continued for over a month, authorities on Monday ordered stores and factories to shut down and all enterprises to work from home. Restaurants are still open, but only for takeout. In Shanghai, retail is a mixed picture. In some areas, almost all restaurants are closed, while in other places it’s possible to eat indoors. Zeng Xifeng, the founder of Tangtangquan, a Shenzhen-based online medical platform for Type 1 diabetes patients, told Sixth Tone that his company moved its business and operation online after 2020, and employees had already adapted to remote work before the current wave. Staff only needed to visit the office on Sunday night to take their monitors home, so they can work on a large screen at home. Zeng said that his experience was typical for those at similar companies. “This is the first citywide shutdown in two years, but I’ve seen almost no panic among companies, employees, or residents,” Zeng said, adding that orders of diabetes medications in Shenzhen hadn’t changed, as hospitals remain open. Half a dozen Shenzhen residents told Sixth Tone that supermarkets and online grocery stores did not appear out of stock over the past week. Some areas in Shanghai have seen panic buying since last Friday, according to the residents Sixth Tone spoke to. Confirmed cases and local lockdowns in Shanghai have mostly happened in residential compounds and office buildings. The hardest-hit areas in Shenzhen are mostly industrial parks and the city’s distinctive “urban villages.” On Weibo, Shenzhen residents have described seeing food delivery drivers sleeping outside to avoid being sealed in their homes in urban villages. A screenshot of a food delivery driver’s comment under a post from the Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission on messaging app WeChat last Sunday went viral online. “I hope the outbreak will end soon. Even if I have to climb nine floors, I will have no complaints. I hope to hand over the delicious food to the customer and say have a good meal. I hope everything will return to normal,” the driver wrote. He Mengze, an electronic components supplier in Shenzhen’s Bao’an District, told Sixth Tone that seven of his workers were infected over the weekend. Now, he is staying in the factory dormitory with his remaining 400 workers for centralized quarantine and daily nucleic acid testing. This will last for at least one week, He said. “A week of shutdown is a huge loss for me,” He said. On video platform Douyin, workers have been discussing how they are going to get paid as factories shut down. Some workers in small factories complained about their boss’ plans to deduct wages as the factory is closed. Lai Weinan, a lawyer based in Shenzhen, told Sixth Tone that companies in the manufacturing and service industries are not allowed to reduce workers’ wages during the business shutdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. But, “to lower costs, companies can treat these days as paid annual leave,” Lai said. Factories may also try to switch to piece rate pay with a low base wage, he added. Spas and hair salon workers, who are usually paid a low base salary and earn money from commissions, are also hit hard, especially since many such shops are located inside closed compounds. A Shanghai masseuse surnamed Chen told Sixth Tone that even if she got her basic wage this week, it’s not going to cover her daily expenses. “I don’t want to take a vacation, even if I’m given one. All I want is more customers and more shifts, and then I can afford to pay this month’s rent,” Chen said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009894
"China Updates Quarantine Rules, Treatments for COVID-19 Patients","Health authorities include antiviral pills, antibody therapy, and acupuncture in its updated guideline.",2022-03-16,"China updated its diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 after almost a year on Tuesday, relaxing quarantine and hospital admission policies for those who test positive for the virus amid a massive surge in infections over the past week. The country’s top health authority said that patients with mild symptoms will now be sent to centralized quarantine facilities instead of designated hospitals for COVID-19 treatment. Previously, individuals who tested positive for the virus were admitted to hospitals regardless of their condition. “It’s a waste of a lot of medical resources if they’re all admitted into hospitals designated to treat COVID-19,” the updated guideline from the National Health Commission said, adding the decision was made after studying recent infections that were relatively milder and required less medical attention. There were also changes in hospital discharge requirements, with the authorities reducing the cycle threshold, or CT value, a technique used to detect COVID-19, from 40 and above to 35. A CT value at 40 and above was considered as testing negative for the coronavirus, but new domestic research has now shown those with CT values between 35 and 40 were unlikely to spread transmission. The current guideline also slashed quarantine requirements for recovered patients from 14 days at home or a centralized location to seven days of at-home self health monitoring. The update also included the use of oral antiviral drug Paxlovid from the U.S. drugmaker Pfizer — granted conditional approval in China last month — and the first domestically developed antibody therapy approved in December. There were also additions to the use of traditional Chinese medicine in treating COVID-19 patients, outlining acupuncture therapies targeting specific acupuncture points for varying symptoms. Last week, Chinese authorities approved COVID-19 rapid antigen self-test kits for public use for the first time. Health experts said the method could expedite testing for certain groups, giving results in minutes compared with the lengthy nucleic acid testing. On Tuesday, China reported 3,054 COVID-19 cases compared with over 5,000 the previous day, according to the National Health Commission. The majority of cases over the past few days have been detected in the northeastern province of Jilin.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009909
Shenzhen Taxi Drivers Are Now Escorting Trucks From Hong Kong,Their job is to ensure vehicles and drivers follow a predetermined route and don’t make unnecessary stops or come in contact with locals.,2022-03-16,"Taxi drivers in Shenzhen are providing a novel service amid its COVID-19 outbreak — escorting truck drivers from across the border. Taxis in the southern tech hub follow cargo trucks coming into the city from neighboring Hong Kong, ensuring that the vehicles and drivers follow a predetermined route and don’t make unplanned stops or come in contact with local residents, financial outlet Jiemian reported Tuesday. Their main task is to ensure the truck drivers stay in “closed-loop management” — China’s bubble-like system implemented to prevent possible virus spillover. The taxi drivers turned truck “escorts” come as both cities experience a surge in COVID-19 cases. While Hong Kong has reported record-high five-digit daily cases over the past weeks, over 17.5 million people in Shenzhen were placed in a weeklong lockdown Sunday as infections climbed in the city. Official data showed that at least 17 cross-border truck drivers tested positive for the coronavirus at Shenzhen port on Sunday, adding to the total of more than 480 since Feb. 4. Trucks moving across the border are an important link between the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Shenzhen authorities said on Feb. 14 that about 8,000 cross-border trucks were engaged in the transportation of supplies, including fresh food, between Shenzhen and Hong Kong daily. It’s unclear if specific taxi drivers choose to escort the trucks or are instructed to do so by city officials. Over a dozen taxi companies and government bureaus Sixth Tone called Wednesday went unanswered or declined to disclose any information. A Shenzhen-based automobile insider, surnamed Chen, told Sixth Tone that taxis labeled as “cross-border transportation escort” wait for trucks with Hong Kong license plates at major highway intersections in the mainland city. He added that such taxis are barred from picking up passengers and receive a 500 yuan ($80) daily allowance from the government. Shenzhen strengthened its virus control measures for cross-border truck drivers in early February, instituting strict rules at port entry points, operational facilities, and accommodation sites. Shenzhen transport authorities said last month that they had punished 882 truck drivers for violating the government’s COVID-19 regulations by either suspending their exemptions from quarantining upon entry for 60 days or having them permanently canceled.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009910
"COVID-19 Cases at a Shanghai Hospital Lead to Chaos, Lockdown",Video footage from inside the emergency unit of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital shows distressed and underprepared staff.,2022-03-15,"A viral video showing chaotic scenes from inside a top Shanghai hospital as the city battles its worst COVID-19 outbreak has once again raised questions about operational challenges and access to healthcare at times when medical institutions are sealed and services are temporarily suspended. The Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital was immediately locked down on March 6 after detecting an “abnormal” nucleic acid test, with thousands of medical workers, patients, and their families stuck inside. It wasn’t until Sunday that video footage — reportedly filmed by a medical worker and posted on microblogging site Weibo — provided a glimpse from that day, with distressed nurses and others complaining of a situation reminiscent of what other cities experienced during previous outbreaks. “We’re not trained to deal with infectious diseases, and we don’t have the proper quarantine supplies to enter a highly-risky area,” a nurse from the emergency ward is heard saying in the video, refusing to move to the floors with COVID-positive patients and their close contacts. “We don’t have a safe place to bathe or sleep, and no adequate time to rest.” As part of the virus control measures, hospitals nationally usually suspend emergency and out-patient services for 48 hours for mass testing and disinfection when they detect an infected patient or a close contact. However, some medical facilities in areas with local outbreaks have required incoming patients to show proof of a negative nucleic acid test before being treated, resulting in delays in accessing health care services. Between December and January, a man died and two women miscarried after facing delayed treatment in the locked-down city of Xi’an in the northwestern Shaanxi province. City authorities then promised to do better following a public outcry over the seemingly preventable tragedies, while China’s vice premier, Sun Chunlan, demanded that hospitals “should not turn away patients under pretense during COVID-19.” On Monday, Wang Xingpeng, director of the Shanghai Hospital Development Center, which administers the city’s top-tier hospitals, said that the Sixth People’s Hospital was sealed after a patient from outside the city tested positive for the virus. He added “five positive environment samples” were found inside the hospital, but didn’t disclose the exact number of infections. “The entire facility has been disinfected, and there are enough quarantine supplies now,” he said. “People inside the hospital will be tested and separated based on the results.” As Shanghai started noticing a surge in coronavirus infections since the start of March — the city logged over 800 cases as of Monday — hundreds of residential complexes with individuals who have tested positive or close contacts have been placed on lockdown. Amid such circumstances, the city’s health authority said that it would “fully support” the needs of residents who are indoors. “There are designated hospitals to satisfy the needs of critically ill patients, pregnant women, children, and patients going through chemotherapies or hemodialysis,” authorities said. “They’ll be sent to hospitals by ambulances in a closed loop.” Some Shanghai residents Sixth Tone spoke with said though they were eventually able to visit hospitals, it wasn’t as easy as before. A few of them complained they didn’t have adequate information on ways to access hospitals during outbreaks. A 76-year-old man who developed a fever after surgery last week said many of the medical facilities in his neighborhood were under a 48-hour lockdown. Therefore, he had to call his surgeon, who directed him to a fever clinic at a downtown hospital. Wang Yi, a parent from Pudong New Area, said that she was initially unwilling to take her son to the doctor after he contracted a fever. But when the high temperature hadn’t subsided by Monday, she drove to a hospital 30 kilometers away — she waited for six hours with her sick child to get a flu medication. “If the situation was not bad enough, we wouldn’t have taken him to a hospital during such a time,” Wang said. “It’s not just my child — a few of his classmates also had a high fever. Some have chosen not to visit a doctor for fear of possible cross-infections.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009892
"With Infections in Thousands, Jilin Battles Worst COVID-19 Outbreak",Authorities say the province’s medical supplies can only last two to three more days.,2022-03-15,"China’s northeastern province of Jilin is experiencing the worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years, with daily cases exceeding over a thousand for the third consecutive day. The province reported a record 4,067 infections in total on Monday, with one-third being asymptomatic, which the country doesn’t include in its COVID-19 tally, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, a total of 5,154 cases were detected nationally. More than 24 million people living in the province — including those in the provincial capital of Changchun and the city of Jilin — have been placed on lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Zhao Qinglong, director of the emergency response office at the Jilin province Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday that the BA.2 sublineage of the highly transmissible Omicron variant was causing the current outbreak, adding that it was 30% more infectious than the previously circulating BA.1 sublineage. He said there was a “hidden transmission” due to the increase in asymptomatic infections, making it easier for the virus to spread in multiple places and clusters. “The number and scope of people affected by the epidemic in our province are relatively large because it’s characterized by hidden transmission,” he said, noting that the virus may have been spreading since late February. Changchun alone has detected more than 2,700 COVID-19 cases in the current wave, with authorities ordering a lockdown Friday. Some 9 million residents are required to stay indoors, with one family member allowed to leave for groceries and other supplies every two days. Provincial authorities emphasized Monday that the coronavirus cases were still rising, describing the situation as “severe and complicated.” Officials vowed to achieve “zero social transmission” — or no community outbreaks — in a week through rigorous testing and control measures. As of Tuesday, five temporary “shelter hospitals” — first erected during the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan — have been put into place in the cities of Changchun and Jilin to treat the influx of patients. The province has 22,880 hospital beds altogether, and officials said they only had enough medical resources for two to three days.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009893
Delayed Revival: China’s Tourism Hubs Map Road to Recovery,Continuing setbacks since 2020 have finally galvanized change across the tourism sector.,2022-03-14,"Last summer, Pan Jianxun eagerly awaited the start of the tourist season in central China’s Henan province. A photographer in the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, he dreamed of capturing on camera the lucrative influx of tourists against the backdrop of endless wheat fields. Pan is employed at “Unique Henan: Land of Drama,” a gigantic complex that boasts 21 theaters spread over 100 acres. After four years of planning and construction, and millions of yuan in investments, it finally opened to tourists on June 6, 2021. Then on July 20, disaster struck. As record rainfall from days of torrential downpours ravaged the province, one-fifth of the Unique Henan project went underwater, damaging at least five theaters. “The wheat fields were submerged under more than half a meter of water,” recalls Pan. After just 45 days in business, the project shut its doors. Instead of photographing the vast fields of wheat gently billowing in the wind, Pan could only record the choppy waters inundating his city. The natural calamity could not have come at a worse time. July marks the beginning of the summer holidays, and with it, peak tourist season. It’s why organizers chose to open Unique Henan in June.  About 700 kilometers away, on the very day the floods ravaged Zhengzhou, Nanjing in the eastern Jiangsu province reported a fresh COVID-19 outbreak. Nine cases were detected at Nanjing Lukou Airport. In the week that followed, it spread to seven areas in five provinces, infecting close to 100 people.  “Scenic areas had just prepared for a resurgence of tourism during the summer holidays, but were forced to shut again,” says Miao Wei, who works at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing’s Purple Mountain Park. Just two months prior, the pandemic had seemingly been contained across China, and tourists at scenic areas began returning to almost pre-pandemic levels. “We were very confident; we figured the crowds were finally coming back,” says Miao. But by mid-2021, after the floods and a fresh outbreak, tourist hubs in Zhengzhou and Nanjing realized they would not be able to make that triumphant comeback. Three months into 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic shows few signs of abating, and the global economy still limps back to normal. While most industries in China have struggled, tourism was, by far, among the hardest hit. People are traveling less than ever before and spending money more cautiously, leaving tourism hubs across the country struggling to cope. If 2020 was already catastrophic for China’s tourist hotspots, it has only gotten worse since. Instead of sudden outbreaks, infections now emerge sporadically, making it even harder for people to guard against it. By March 14, the Chinese mainland has reported 8,531 currently confirmed COVID-19 cases in provinces and cities from the northeastern province of Jilin to southern Guangdong. And with infections still persisting in Henan province as well as the cities of Tianjin and Shenzhen, tourist destinations stare at another bleak year ahead. Experts, however, see a silver lining: The endless setbacks over the last two years have finally compelled China’s tourism industry to reinvent itself. Stalled recovery In Henan, the floods were only the beginning. Soon after, new COVID-19 cases were detected in the province, preventing Unique Henan from reopening until Sep. 3. The most lucrative season for tourism had been rendered a total write-off. Early last November, another wave of infections shut Unique Henan again, this time for more than two weeks. “In all my 16 years on the job, this was the most venue closures I’d ever experienced in one year,” rued the complex’s head of marketing, who requested anonymity. He Xiu manages online reservations at the Autumn Harvest Uprising Memorial Park in Liuyang, a popular revolutionary site in Henan. During the pandemic, she also had to assume other responsibilities, such as checking health and travel codes, as well as reminding visitors to wear their masks. “Safeguarding the park amid the unending pandemic control and prevention regulations was no easy task,” she says. Over the last year, He Xiu noticed that more and more tourists preferred to make reservations online before visiting the park. “Because this is an educational space related to the communist revolution, it is free and open to the public. Initially, people didn’t understand why they had to make reservations beforehand. Some tourists complained that the process was very complicated. But slowly, people became more understanding,” she says. Now, she has grown accustomed to patiently de-escalating volatile situations, assisting the elderly in making reservations, while simultaneously enforcing the park’s disease prevention measures. The unease is not limited to just Henan and Jiangsu. Tourism hubs across the country currently face two simultaneous challenges: plummeting footfall and maintaining the delicate balance between management and disease prevention.  Wei Xiao’an, chief expert of the World Tourism Cities Federation and director of the China Leisure Association’s Holiday Branch, says that among all the nation’s scenic areas and landmarks, most are looking at severe losses, a minority will manage to break even, while only a handful may eke out a meager profit. According to Xin Hongye, vice-director at the Information Center of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, three facts about the pandemic so far have caught people off guard: that it has lasted for so long, that its influence has been so wide, and that it emerges again and again. “Preventive measures have become the new norm. Over the last two years, the tourism industry has been on a rollercoaster ride of shock, surprise, and fear. Now, every time things seem to be looking up, we pray it’s not an illusion,” says Xin, with a sigh. Silver lining Despite the persistent disruptions, there was an upside: the pandemic underscored the importance of reinvention. Across the latter half of 2021, China’s tourism industry shifted gears, implementing a series of fundamental transformations — providing better services, tapping into new markets, and prioritizing quality. Among the pandemic’s biggest challenges the sector had to account for were changes to lifestyles and travel habits: people were more hesitant to travel greater distances, and fewer and fewer chose to even leave their home provinces. Data from tourism platforms show that the percentage of trips over 300 kilometers significantly decreased, while trips within 50 km surged. Not only are shorter trips less expensive, but they also allow greater flexibility in terms of time management, as demonstrated by the continual increase in the percentage of weekend getaways. Many interviewees indicated that they now preferred local tourism and staycations at resorts on the outskirts of their cities, over traveling to major destinations, which require week-long holidays and mean long queues. “Currently, a lot of tourist consumption has been redirected towards urban leisure and countryside resorts,” says Wei Xiao’an, chief expert of the World Tourism Cities Federation. Pre-pandemic tourism — crammed into coaches, shuttling from one landmark to the next, taking photos, and going home — now finds little appeal among consumers, according to experts. Scenic areas no longer dominate the tourism ecosystem. Take, for example, one particular hotel in the suburbs of Beijing, which, overnight, witnessed an exponential increase in footfall. To provide better entertainment for the sudden influx of guests, the hotel temporarily installed a bouncy castle for children in its luxury 500-people capacity banquet hall. “We can’t keep believing that, after doing nothing in the lockdown for so long, we can simply return to our old models of operation and achieve the same success as before,” says Xin Hongye, vice-director at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Heihe in the northern Heilongjiang province is China’s volcano capital. Here, the Wudalianchi UNESCO Global Geopark once primarily banked on tourist traffic lining up at the “natural volcano museum” or relaxing in the hot springs. When business ground to a halt during the pandemic, the base quickly pivoted to research. It proactively forged ties with several Chinese geological faculties and scientific expedition teams, and focused on becoming a leading center for field research. Though the idea languished in the pipeline for years, the pandemic finally spurred the Geopark into action. “China is a big country abundant in natural resources. Each of its scenic areas has unique geographical, cultural, and historical advantages. This pandemic has truly provided an opportunity to do some soul-searching about our purpose,” says Xin Hongye. The reinvention marked a fundamental shift away from the traditional business philosophy, which exclusively focused on revenue from entrance fees. “The days of simply setting up a toll booth at the foot of a mountain are well gone,” says Xin. Change has now seeped into every step of the management process. Take, for instance, ticket reservations. Since this is the first point of contact for visitors, it is also a crucial step in disease prevention. The service thus demonstrates a site’s management capabilities. Miao Wei, who has worked at Nanjing’s Purple Mountain Park for over 10 years, says the park began testing an online ticket reservation system in 2017. Since the pandemic, such systems have assumed greater significance. In addition to allowing tourists to confirm their itineraries in advance, they are also a critical tool used to limit entries and bolster disease prevention. Miao explains that some out-of-town tourists did not realize that their health code information changed with sudden developments in the pandemic. This sometimes resulted in them being unable to enter the park or caused other issues with their travels. During the National Day holiday in October 2021, the Jiangsu Provincial Culture and Tourism Bureau facilitated data exchange between its own intelligent platform and other online platforms so tourists could validate their health codes before visiting the province’s many attractions. This initiative allowed Purple Mountain Park to simultaneously validate a tourist’s health code, travel code, and reservation code. To complete reservations, visitors are first required to scan a QR code to validate their health codes. To enter the park, they simply open their health and travel codes from the QR code reservation page. This prevents tourists from traveling in vain and makes park entry more convenient. “Before, we often talked about a triumphant comeback. What we’re actually experiencing now isn’t a comeback or a recovery — it’s more like a business awakening,” says Xin Hongye. Striving, not struggling As the tourism sector readies for a new year ahead in 2022, Wei Xiao’an, chief expert of the World Tourism Cities Federation, believes China’s scenic areas have now achieved a relatively stable balance of offer and demand. “There are now enough existing sites to satisfy tourists, negating the need to develop new ones on a large scale,” says Wei, adding that the high-intensity development of scenic areas over the course of the last 40 years has essentially peaked. “The two-year-long pandemic only burst the bubble. Those that need transformation and improvements must do so now. How we fare in the competition to come will depend on quality, not on cheap prices,” he asserts. Incidentally, the industry has already agreed on the need to shift from simplistic, excessive development to quality enhancement. “Fine-tuning identities and branding, honing internal capacities, redefining approaches to the market, tapping into the core value of their resources, and providing more personalized services — honestly, there’s a lot that scenic areas can do,” says Xin Hongye.  Wei Xiao’an points to Hunan province’s Mangshan National Forest Park, which he visited thrice in the past year, as a prime example. “Mangshan’s greatest merit is the way it has made alpine tourism accessible. Thanks to the park’s cableways, elevators, escalators, and wheelchairs, tourists of all ages and abilities are able to explore the mountaintop with no difficulty,” he says. At the park, Wei saw people in their 80s or 90s as well as disabled people moving up the mountain in wheelchairs. He also recommends that other scenic areas take a leaf out of Mangshan’s book. “Larger scenic areas should take into consideration their unique advantages to provide comprehensive and diverse tourist experiences, rather than purely focusing on sightseeing,” he says.  According to Wei Xiao’an, the elderly in China are a neglected demographic. “The opinions and travel habits of the elderly today differ greatly from their predecessors. Not only do they have time and resources — they’re also more willing to spend,” he says. Before the pandemic, Wei Xiao’an made annual overseas trips, where he noticed that the vast majority of tourists were senior citizens. Now, this demographic depends on domestic sites to fulfill their desire for tourism. For several years now, Purple Mountain Park has explored different paths of innovation to transition into a comprehensive holiday destination. On Nov. 30, 2021, the structure of the park’s tourist services center was completed, which will act as a hub for transfers between different modes of transport as well as provide tourist services, travel guides, and urban leisure. Even with a clearly defined concept, polished products, and equally refined services, marketing is still king. The marketing of Unique Henan made several breakthroughs that allowed the entire initiative to rapidly get off the ground. The first post on the initiative’s WeChat account, titled “I’m Not a Real Henan Native,” was written by Qin Shuo, an author and media professional from Henan. It has since amassed 300,000 views, thus creating tremendous visibility. Unique Henan also prioritized multiple channels of collaboration. When it first opened its doors, it joined hands with lifestyle influencers and social media platforms to create online content that highlighted its unique attributes. This online buzz increased footfall as well as profits. The initiative also employed multiple social media managers to respond to, and make changes based on online feedback. In fewer than six months, despite closing shop thrice — first after the floods, and then twice during outbreaks — the theater complex nonetheless accommodated more than 500,000 visitors, with its performances attracting more than three million attendees. Among the visitors, close to one-third came from outside the province. Many traveled all the way from Beijing, Shanghai, and even the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China’s northwest. In the future, thorough strategies that address the entire marketing process — from conceptualization and rebranding to promotion and reputation maintenance — will be essential to the development of any scenic area. Challenges ahead For tourist hubs, better business strategies were not the only positive takeaway over the last two years but also improved disease prevention and control, particularly since the pandemic shows few signs of abating soon.  Breakthroughs were made in the areas of ticket reservations, restricting footfall, and encouraging off-season visits. As trans-regional tourism decreases, some hubs have attempted to gain a foothold in the staycation market. Changes include membership systems to increase customer loyalty, fine-tuning branding, offering a greater range of services, and tapping into the location’s unique cultural significance. At a summit in November 2021, Liu Yanxiang, general manager of Meituan’s tickets and travel division, said the tourism industry must abandon pipe dreams and keep up with the zeitgeist: “We must strive, not struggle.” Last year, Shanghai’s Disneyland showed how. On Oct. 31, to comply with local COVID-19 orders, the park shut its doors at 6 p.m. so every visitor could be tested within one hour. Despite the daunting task ahead, the park decided to go ahead with its fireworks display. It made for quite the scene: Under a night sky lit up by a cascade of colorful sparks, tourists and locals alike lined up in an orderly fashion to get tested. That evening, Zhang Wenhong, an infectious diseases expert from Shanghai, wrote on the microblogging platform Weibo: “Thank you for today’s display of fireworks. It allowed us to witness the calm composure of humans in the face of adversity as well as their confidence in the future.” As 2022 beckons, the battle ahead for China’s tourism industry is evident. But embracing change with an open mind, doing what is difficult but right, and reinventing while still remaining true to one’s essence will make the battle just that little bit easier.

China Approves COVID-19 Self-Test Kits as Infections Spike,Health experts say it could serve as a simple and fast way to detect the virus amid higher caseload.,2022-03-14,"China has for the first time approved COVID-19 rapid antigen self-test kits for public use, as the country reports its highest coronavirus cases in two years driven by the fast-spreading Omicron variant.  The antigen tests will be added as a supplement to nucleic acid testing, and used by individuals visiting local clinics with respiratory symptoms and fever, those in isolation, and residents with needs for early detection, the National Health Commission announced Friday. Individuals who test positive for the virus using antigen tests are required to report to their residential community manager and undergo a nucleic acid test for additional confirmation, though it’s unclear how the measures will be enforced.  Until now, people could only receive nucleic acid tests at designated hospitals and testing centers, the results of which are directly transferred to the government database. Individuals can then access the results through local health cloud apps. “Recently, the Omicron variant has accelerated the spread of the virus, and we have seen a surge of cases in Shanghai and many other areas in China,” Zhang Wenhong, the infectious diseases expert tasked with managing Shanghai’s coronavirus response, told domestic media. Zhang said relying on nucleic acid testing alone could pose challenges during a fast-evolving situation, considering the logistical needs and the time required to get results. He added that antigen tests, which yield results in minutes, could substitute as a simple and fast way to detect the virus, “just like a self-administered at-home pregnancy test.” China’s drug regulator, the National Medical Products Administration, has named five domestic companies to provide such kits, state broadcaster China Central Television reported Saturday. The single-use test kit costing about 30 yuan ($5) — 10 yuan less than nucleic acid tests at public hospitals — are available online, and will reportedly hit pharmacies this week.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009883
Shanghai Slows Down to Curb COVID-19 Spread,The city of 24 million has shut schools and entertainment venues and placed thousands in quarantine as it scrambles to contain its worst virus outbreak.,2022-03-14,"SHANGHAI — Shanghai has suspended long-distance bus services, shut down entertainment venues, and placed hundreds of residential compounds, university campuses, and office buildings on lockdown as the city grapples with its most serious COVID-19 outbreak since the pandemic started two years ago. China’s financial hub has logged over 700 infections — 89% of them asymptomatic — since the first case in the current wave was detected on March 1, according to local health authorities. On Friday, local authorities admitted that management loopholes at a downtown quarantine hotel accommodating returnees from overseas had led to the local outbreak. The city of over 24 million people wore a deserted look during the weekend — traffic was sparse, and malls and metro stations were relatively quiet amid a lack of locals and tourists. The city’s epidemic control unit urged residents to limit unnecessary travels, while travelers required a negative virus test 48 hours before leaving the city or after arrival.  Shanghai’s education authority also suspended in-person classes at schools starting Saturday and ordered citywide COVID-19 tests for all students after some were found to be infected with the virus. This is the first time classes have moved online since they resumed in mid-2020 following a monthslong break at the height of the pandemic in China. “The crowd inside the school and outside the school gate when the kids were dismissed after testing was really worrying,” one father standing outside a school in the Pudong New Area told Sixth Tone. “I never felt the virus could be so close to me, not even in 2020.” Shanghai’s health authorities have attributed the uptick in cases to the BA.2 sublineage of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The city, previously touted for keeping the virus at bay with few disruptions during occasional flare ups, now has infections in 15 of its 16 districts, barring Chongming Island. As the city swiftly moves to identify suspected infections and their close contacts, authorities have placed hundreds of thousands of residents on lockdown since last week. Most residential complexes with an infection have instituted a 14-day lockdown, while those with close contacts who didn’t test positive for the virus are sealed for 48 hours.  Wang Qianwen, who lives in Pudong District, said two buildings in her neighborhood are currently sealed. She also found that nearly all businesses beside her mother’s residence in Minhang District were shut when she visited to deliver her groceries. “Buying food online isn’t convenient for elderly people,” she told Sixth Tone. “My mother is in her late 70s and lives alone, and she doesn’t use a smartphone. Currently, there aren’t enough volunteers to help in my mother’s neighborhood. I’m afraid she might have trouble accessing daily necessities.” Jia Mingming, another Pudong resident, said she had previously experienced 48-hour lockdowns in November and January, but wasn’t expecting a 14-day stay-home order after a neighbor tested positive for the virus. Though she was grateful to work from home and be with her daughter, Jia said, “losing my freedom made me upset.” Across China, tens of millions of people have been barred from movement — major cities such as the northeastern city of Changchun in Jilin province and the tech hub of Shenzhen in the southern Guangdong province have imposed citywide lockdowns amid surging virus cases. On Sunday, China reported 2,125 COVID-19 cases, of which 1,026 were in Jilin.  Many cities across the country have announced mass testing amid sporadic outbreaks, though Shanghai is yet to announce such a measure. Instead, the city had adopted concentrated testing, prioritizing residential complexes and neighborhoods with confirmed or suspected infections. “I’ve received one nucleic test daily in the past four days,” a local resident, surnamed Shen, in downtown Xuhui District told Sixth Tone. “The situation is a bit chaotic. It’s safer if all people could just stay at home for a week or two.” The rising number of infections in Shanghai have, however, spooked its neighbors, with some nearby cities announcing stringent measures to prevent possible transmissions. For example, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province requires all travelers arriving from Shanghai to undergo three-day home quarantine and 11 days of health monitoring. A district in the city of Nantong is offering 200 yuan ($30) rewards for reporting anyone arriving from Shanghai or other “medium or high-risk” areas, if they haven't already been identified by local virus prevention units. Meanwhile, health experts in Shanghai said that the current wave would not break the city’s defense system against the virus. A top virologist acknowledged the city lagged behind in its response, as it was caught off guard by the sudden explosion of the Omicron variant. “But in the long fight against the virus, we should not lose our confidence,” Zhang Wenhong, the infectious diseases expert tasked with managing Shanghai’s coronavirus response, wrote on his personal Weibo microblog Monday. “To stick to the ‘zero-COVID’ policy, Shanghai has slowed down its pace, and once the city’s pace becomes slow, the virus won’t spread fast.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009882
"China Sees Over 1,000 COVID-19 Cases for First Time Since 2020","Several cities are experiencing a surge in infections, mostly driven by asymptomatic cases.",2022-03-11,"China has reported more than 1,000 COVID-19 infections for the first time since the early days of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan two years ago, posing challenges in maintaining the country’s “zero COVID” policy. On Thursday, 19 provincial-level areas logged 1,100 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases, a surge from just over 100 infections earlier this month, according to the National Health Commission. About 64% of the cases were asymptomatic, which China doesn’t include in its COVID-19 tally. Shandong and Jilin provinces reported the most COVID-19 cases Thursday, respectively, the majority of which were asymptomatic. Shanghai also saw another jump in infections — though slightly fewer than the previous day — with the city reporting 11 confirmed and 64 asymptomatic cases.  Shanghai has reported 396 local infections — about 91% are said to be asymptomatic — since the first confirmed case in the current wave was detected on March 1. The city has so far designated six areas as “medium risk,” and has swiftly moved to curb further spread of the virus by sealing off some residential neighborhoods, office buildings, and schools. On Friday, Shanghai health officials said some of the local clusters were traced to contaminated surroundings from imported cases, resulting in local infections and transmission due to “lapses in management.” The oversight occurred at a quarantine hotel in Xuhui District, designated as one of the medium-risk areas. Local officials said the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was responsible for the surge in asymptomatic infections, adding that the city’s mass vaccination program has enhanced people’s immunity.  Amid the virus surge, Shanghai has also shut many sporting and entertainment venues — including museums, libraries, art galleries, theaters, and parks — to minimize crowd gathering. Multiple theaters in downtown Jing’an District told Sixth Tone that they were ordered to shut down Thursday until further notice. Although Shanghai has refrained from posing citywide lockdowns or curbs largely adopted by smaller cities, local officials urged residents to reduce taking public transport and avoid unnecessary gatherings. Authorities have also asked residents to undergo a nucleic acid test within 48 hours before leaving the city and after returning.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009868
Worried Pet Owners Crowdsource Info as COVID-19 Surge in Shanghai,Animal lovers band together to prevent pets from being possibly mistreated by quarantine staff.,2022-03-10,"With many Shanghai residents abruptly receiving quarantine notices amid another COVID-19 outbreak, the city’s animal lovers have started to crowdsource information on emergency pet care to prevent any possible tragedies. Spare Leash, a pet-sitting platform headquartered in Shanghai, is among several service providers that has outlined tips for the city’s pet parents in case of possible quarantine. The company said pet safety had become a valid concern after recent news of another pet being killed while the owners faced centralized quarantine. Last week, a Samoyed dog named Snowball was beaten to death by quarantine staff in the southern city of Huizhou while owners were quarantined. A similar case in the eastern Jiangxi province sparked public outrage in November. China currently doesn’t have a standardized policy on handling pets whose owners test positive for COVID-19 or are quarantined for suspected infections. In the past years, various local authorities have announced their own rules, with the city of Beijing calling for “humanistic care and warm services” while isolating pets in February.  With Shanghai reporting more than 300 COVID-19 local infections since the beginning of March, many people have found themselves in snap quarantines at homes, offices, and even malls. The city’s Noble Pet Resorts said that they had received calls from many worried pet owners this week, seeking potential help if they were to be quarantined. The owner of Noble Pet Resorts, who identified himself as Hunter, told Sixth Tone that he had rented two facilities capable of handling 10 animals each in the suburbs, offering them at reduced prices for people infected by the virus. He said he hadn’t yet received any animals from quarantined pet owners, though some were already sending their pets out of caution. He also went to feed the cats of an individual who tested positive for the coronavirus Wednesday, after receiving a call. “I’m doing this all by myself to lower the risk,” he said, adding he wears protective clothing and undergoes a nucleic acid test every day. BuddyDog, a pet hotel in Shanghai, has also received an outpouring of calls from pet parents, according to its manager, surnamed Zou. She said many of the company’s recent callers were foreigners, with some afraid of a possible tragedy. “What we do now is share experiences and offer professional advice, trying to relax the owners,” Zou said. “They are over-panicked. Owners can just put the pets in carriers before they leave for quarantine. Then we go over, pick up the pets and sanitize all the items.” A 25-year-old pet owner, surnamed Li, said she has been anxious about her pet if she would be quarantined. She said she has joined a few chat groups on messaging platform WeChat, and is relying on crowdsourced information to prepare an emergency pack for her dog. “We have to stick together and help each other,” Li said. “We are fed up with news about pets being mistreated by quarantine staff.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009862
China Reports Most COVID-19 Cases Since Early Days of Pandemic,Health authorities said the highly transmissible Omicron variant is responsible for the surge.,2022-03-07,"China has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases since the early days of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, with major cities logging an uptick in infections. The country reported 526 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases Sunday — up from 302 infections reported the day before — in 14 provincial-level areas, according to the National Health Commission. Of them, 214 were confirmed cases, and the remaining asymptomatic, which China doesn’t include in its COVID-19 tally. Health authorities said that the highly transmissible Omicron variant was driving the latest wave of infections, putting several major Chinese cities on high alert, mostly due to the surge in asymptomatic cases. In Shanghai, 45 of the 48 local cases reported Sunday showed no symptoms. The city has launched concentrated mass testing in residential neighborhoods where the infected individuals and their close contacts lived or visited, contrary to citywide testing adopted by many cities. Shanghai, with four “medium-risk” areas, has also temporarily suspended outpatient services and fever clinics in some hospitals for virus control measures. Qingdao, the coastal city in the eastern Shandong province, emerged as another COVID-19 hotspot over the weekend. The majority of the 251 cases reported Saturday and Sunday were found among students and staff of the Laixi No.7 Middle School, as well as their close contacts. Xing Xiaobo, a senior official in the Qingdao Municipal Health Commission, said during a weekend press conference that the coronavirus might have been spreading in the boarding school before infections were detected Friday. The provinces of Guangdong and Jilin in the south and northeast, respectively, have also seen a surge in COVID-19 cases. On Sunday, Guangdong, Jilin, and Shandong saw the most coronavirus infections nationally. China has been swift in quashing sporadic virus outbreaks in line with its “zero COVID” policy, which health experts and officials have touted for minimizing the number of infections and deaths. However, this has often led to snap lockdowns, disrupting local businesses. As of Sunday, China had logged 111,196 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 4,636 deaths — a relatively smaller number than other countries. Globally, some 5.9 million people have died of the disease, as the number of infections exceeded 446 million, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009833
How China’s Medical Personnel Deal With ‘Zero COVID’,An infectious diseases doctor talks about her experience fighting four coronavirus waves in Zhengzhou.,2022-02-23,"On Jan. 4, the year’s first snow fell in Zhengzhou, central Henan province, whitening roofs and trees. In the house of Liu Qing, the pink camellias were in full bloom. But just like last year, Liu wasn’t home to enjoy the flowers. Her husband sent her some photos, and asked her to make sure to take care of herself. Liu, 51, is the director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Zhengzhou People’s Hospital. She took a quick glance at her husband’s messages but had no time to reply. A day earlier, COVID-19 had reappeared in Zhengzhou, and the number of confirmed infections surged over the following days in a 17-day outbreak that would end up totaling 139 cases.  Such a caseload for a city of 12.6 million people is comparatively low. On Jan. 3, the day Zhengzhou’s latest outbreak was first noticed, similarly sized New York City was in the middle of its own COVID-19 surge and recorded 38,000 positive tests. There, as in much of the rest of the world, medical personnel have been under immense strain to deal with towering waves of infections. But despite low case figures, China’s doctors and nurses aren’t strangers to the stresses of pandemic-era health care. The country’s strict “zero-COVID” policy, which has achieved remarkably low infection figures through drastic measures, puts medical workers under enormous pressure to contain outbreaks. Any mistakes can hurt careers, including those of superiors up to the level of a city’s political leadership. Such scrutiny exacts a toll of its own. In a recent interview, Zeng Guang, an epidemiologist and a member of an expert panel advising China’s national health authority, called for a more rational approach to pandemic prevention to relieve pressure on medical personnel. “I have heard that in some places, COVID-19 patients didn’t die, but the attending staff died of exhaustion,” he said. Zeng was apparently referring to a striking contrast in China’s COVID-19 casualty statistics. Though nobody on the Chinese mainland has died from COVID-19 for over a year, medical personnel are succumbing to high workloads related to containing the virus. In January 2022 alone, a 55-year-old doctor in Zhoukou, also in Henan province, died of exhaustion, and a quarantine center worker in Xi’an, in central China, died from cardiac arrest. During outbreaks, people who live in areas with recorded infections but seek regular medical care have also suffered. Because they did not have a recent negative test result or the correct QR code on a health tracking app, two pregnant women lost their unborn children, and a man with chest pain died after being denied medical care during a recent outbreak in Xi’an.  Zhengzhou’s January COVID-19 scare was Liu’s fourth round fighting the pandemic. During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020, the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou was designated the city’s hospital for COVID-19 patients. In three later waves — in July and November of 2021, and January this year — Liu’s hospital was responsible for providing care to people living in areas with outbreaks or living in quarantine centers.  On Jan. 6, the news of the hospital “receiving 200 patients from locked-down and monitored areas within two days” was widely shared online, with social media users quick to point out the apparent difference in attitude compared to the Xi’an hospitals who had denied care. As infectious diseases doctors, Liu and her colleagues are closely involved in emergency procedures to prevent in-hospital infections. During the most recent outbreak, she was only able to rest three to four hours a day. Sometimes, she didn’t eat dinner until 9 p.m., and was still attending patients in emergency care after 10 at night. “Too busy with work, too much physical exertion,” she said during an interview, her voice hoarse on the other end of the phone. One time, she only slept for two hours. Feeling her body pushed to the limit, she experienced chest pain. “Every time I say I’ll never do that again, but every time I do it again.” Liu said, “This is my responsibility. I can’t just say I quit, and walk away, can I?”  The following is Liu Qing’s story, as told to The Paper.  On Jan. 3, 2022, a local confirmed case once more appeared in Zhengzhou. Having just experienced two waves of the pandemic in 2021, we didn’t even have time to catch our breath. We entered battle mode and knew that all the work we did before would need to be repeated. Since August last year, our hospital has been a designated hospital for people in locked-down and monitored areas, as well as for people in quarantine centers. When the pandemic was stable, patients would mainly come in with fevers or be from medium- and high-risk areas. The number was relatively low, and only one floor of the isolation ward was open. Once local cases appeared in Zhengzhou, however, not only patients with fevers but also those with various illnesses would come to our hospital. In January, the pandemic spread particularly rapidly. In the first few days, over 20 cases were added every day, and the scope of locked-down and monitored areas continued to expand. In addition, it was winter, with a high incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory, and other diseases, so patient numbers surged. The isolation ward began using 10 floors. There were many ambulances at the gate to the hospital. Last August, ambulances brought in as many as 90 patients a day, which doubled this time around. On one day in early January, 186 patients were brought in. We arranged for three doctors to receive them. The fever clinic was also crowded, with over 200 fever patients a day at most — two or three times as many as before. At present, the government requires that if a fever patient from a locked-down area does not have a negative nucleic acid report from within the last 24 hours, they must undergo a test. Before they can leave the fever clinic, we will place them under observation and wait for the results, which generally come back in a little more than two hours. In cases of acute and critical patients, we treat them first, test them simultaneously, and keep them in the emergency transition ward while waiting for the results. Doctors know that there can be no delay for critical conditions. They must not refuse to treat someone because their nucleic acid results have not come back. Recently, there were too many patients coming in every day, especially for cerebral hemorrhages (which are more common during winter). In the first few days, over 400 emergency patients were admitted. There was an old man in his 70s who came with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and shock. The possibility of rescue was very small. A CT scan found an intestinal perforation. After an emergency operation, he underwent intestinal resection and was put on a ventilator. Fortunately, we saved his life in time. There were also many pregnant women. On Jan. 4 and 5, 10 pregnant women were received from locked-down areas. The arrival of pregnant women is of great concern. We want to arrange things as soon as possible. Sometimes their water breaks and the baby is about to come out. In those cases, emergency personnel will call us while they are on the way. We will quickly contact an obstetrician and send them to an isolated delivery room when they arrive. There was a high-risk pregnant woman who had to be quarantined while she was about to give birth to her first baby. She showed up by herself, totally unprepared. The baby’s clothes and supplies were all arranged with the help of our medical staff. Medical staff also helped with nursing her baby, and putting it to bed. Every patient sent here, regardless of the severity of the illness, may be COVID-19 positive — so we have to treat each patient as if they are a positive case. Once a positive case is identified, it needs to be reported and cross-checked, and the patient needs to be transferred to a designated COVID-19 hospital.  Fear and anxiety This year is my 28th year in medicine. After I graduated as a respiratory disease major in 1994, I entered the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou and worked in the ICU of the emergency ward. In 2019, the hospital reconstituted the Department of Infectious Diseases and expanded the team of doctors. Before that, the department was very small, with only three or four doctors and few patients. Doctors here mainly looked at simple measles and chickenpox cases, and had annual incomes of only thousands of yuan (hundreds of dollars). After the reorganization, there were more than a dozen infectious disease doctors. In ordinary times, they would mainly look at unexplained fevers, infections of various systems such as in the lungs, abdominal cavity, and urinary tract, as well as manage antibiotics. Only a year after its establishment, COVID-19 broke out, and the hospital immediately opened its isolation ward. The work of the isolation ward and fever clinic has been mainly undertaken by our department. At first, we mostly received fever patients. After they arrived, we checked for COVID-19. If two nucleic acid test come back negative within 24 hours, we can transfer them to the general ward. It was relatively simple, and there were not so many patients. Since then, the hospital has gradually established a reserve team for epidemic prevention, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory, and other specialists. In the beginning, COVID-19 was not widely known to people, so fear was widespread. One colleague actually trembled when he heard that the patient he received had been diagnosed as positive. I said, “You wear protective clothing, and everything is in order; don’t be afraid.” He replied, “I know I shouldn’t be nervous, but I can’t stop myself.” This January, when he received another confirmed case, he didn’t even flinch. The patients also didn’t know much about the disease at first. They were isolated into single rooms, unlike before when they could walk around and have family visits. Thus, some developed various psychological problems and needed counseling from our medical staff. I remember a woman in her 60s who had returned to Zhengzhou from Wuhan. She was positive. She was in a bad mood initially and called me several times a day because it was the only thing that would calm her down. Later, after she recovered, she knitted a sweater for me, and always sent me greetings during holidays. Another patient and his wife came back from abroad and tested positive at the airport. He was sent to our hospital for treatment. His wife was seriously ill and, for reasons I’m not aware of, was sent to another hospital in Baotou in northern China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Unable to contact his wife, he was very anxious. We tried every means to contact the prevention and control office in Baotou to find his wife’s attending doctor, and then were able to contact his wife and learn that she was out of danger. The man’s mood improved immediately, and his condition recovered quickly.  “Everyone has cried” After becoming a designated hospital for locked-down and monitored areas in 2021, the infectious diseases team came into contact with various diseases and various acute and critical patients. The workload surged instantaneously. We couldn’t all adapt to the physical and psychological pressure it brought in the beginning. First, there was the pressure of treatment. There are risks in treating emergency patients, and some patients may not make it. In the isolated operating room, everyone wears level-3 protection, including a face shield, which makes operations more difficult. Meanwhile, there are corresponding national policies for prevention and control, some of which include red lines that cannot be crossed. For example, if a patient is diagnosed as a positive case, medical staff will have to review the surveillance to see if there were any omissions in the reception process. In terms of pandemic prevention, no one cares about winning honors — what we want is to make no mistakes. If something happens, someone may bear legal responsibility. Sometimes it involves not only yourself, but also your superiors. So that’s a heavy burden. The government’s requirements are constantly changing, and we need to be able to adjust to them in a moment’s notice. In the past, when a patient was admitted, they first saw the doctor, and then we checked their blood and administered a nucleic acid test. Now they take a nucleic acid test first, and only then can they see the doctor. Not all patients understand these policies. For example, some fever patients just want us to prescribe some medicine. According to state requirements, if a patient comes to the fever clinic, they can’t leave until their nucleic acid results come out. If someone loses their temper, they must be comforted. Some patients need to be hospitalized, but the beds in the ward can’t be arranged immediately. Some patients need radiotherapy, and sometimes that can’t be provided. Some dialysis patients come without making an appointment through the community clinic, but dialysis resources are also limited. You explain this to them, but they don’t understand and begin to yell at the staff.  In addition, since the workload is extremely heavy, there are bound to be instances where we can’t cater to a patient’s every need, and they complain. And when you wear a protective mask, you already feel suffocated. Sometimes when you see a long line of anxious patients, you’ll get anxious too. Everyone has cried, especially when the workload surged. Sometimes you feel like you’re going to collapse, but some young medical staff say they can’t take it anymore, and you need to cheer them up. When some colleagues cry, we buy them a little cake or order takeout to ease their mood. The hospital also gives us a lot of fruit. Some colleagues had to spend their birthday in the isolation ward, so we sent them a birthday cake. Colleagues who are not in the isolation ward send us homemade food. The hospital also organizes psychologists to work with frontline medical staff. For us, seeing a patient turn the corner, from being unable to eat or sit to being able to communicate with you — their gratitude and recognition give you a great sense of achievement. This harmonious doctor-patient relationship is the greatest reward for our work, and a great comfort when we are tired. Some young doctors and nurses said they were afraid to tell their parents about what happens at work, for fear that they would worry. I told them, “When you go back with honors (given in recognition for their work during a COVID-19 outbreak), your family will be proud.” There is a saying I particularly like: There is no wasted road in life, and every step counts. Once you’ve experienced it all, you’ll feel like you’ve grown up and have become more competent. We used to feel very bulky in protective clothing, but now we’re used to it. Our work experience has also increased. But this process is really painful, because there are many more physical and psychological challenges than normal. The virus changes rapidly, and many medical staff are still afraid.  Inner power During this time, I got up at 6:40 every morning and was generally busy until 9 or 10 p.m. At any time in the middle of the night, there can be work calls about patients in critical conditions, beds that need to be coordinated, newly transferred patients, and so on. You have to be able to go in at any time. We only had three or four hours to rest every day. And you can’t remember the date. I never knew what day of the week it was. The staff was on their toes all day long. Last August, we didn’t rest for the first 20 days of the outbreak, which lasted until Sept. 12. The November wave also lasted nearly a month. The first few days were full of energy. But after a while, I couldn’t bear it. I thought I had reached my limit last August. This January, the workload doubled. Each time I think, I can’t do it again. But every time I do. No matter how exhausted I was, I always went back to work like a little Superman the following day. You don’t know how much power you have in yourself. Once you get going, you feel like you have endless strength. My husband says, “take care of yourself,” every time. My parents, both 90 years old, know I’m working, and seldom call for fear that I’ll worry about them. My brother sometimes says, “If you have time, call our parents — they’re very worried about you.” Of course I know that. But when I’m in the midst of things, I can’t find time to take care of my loved ones — and anyway, they’re used to it. We counted the days with our fingers. When would the locked-down and monitored areas be unlocked and unmonitored? Zhengzhou’s outbreak was finally declared over on Jan. 29. My biggest wish is for an end to the pandemic, to just live a normal life, and to go home to rest and be with my family. A version of this article originally appeared in The Paper.

China Planning Post Covid-Zero Policy; 71 Cases in Eight Provinces Monday,Epidemiologist from China CDC says teams are studying COVID policy that is ‘not zero cases and not laissez-faire.’,2022-02-21,"China reported 71 confirmed local COVID-19 infections on Monday, as health authorities mentioned a possible change to the country’s COVID-zero strategy. The cases occurred across eight provinces and province-level regions spanning the length and width of the country, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Yunnan, and Guangdong. Wu Liangyou, deputy director of the disease control bureau of the National Health Commission, said at a press conference Saturday that the disease is still spreading locally following the Spring Festival holiday. Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a conference last Tuesday he was cautiously optimistic that the pandemic will end this year. He said that Chinese health authorities are studying a move away from the zero-tolerance approach that has largely prevented the disease’s spread at the cost of cutting off most international travel. Several teams are studying how to improve China’s existing prevention and control measures, the medical expert said, developing an approach that is neither the current “zero cases” policy nor laissez-faire. The new approach will control the pandemic and put “people first and life first,” while also integrating with the international community to resume normal international exchanges and economic development, Wu said. At the Saturday press conference, Wu Liangyou gave updates on the control of the outbreaks currently in progress around China. Gene sequencing of the cases in the northern city of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia have shown they are caused by the Delta variant and started from an “overseas import source,” Wu said. He provided no further information about the source of the outbreak. He added that the outbreak is still at an early stage with the number of cases growing rapidly, driven in part by clusters in densely crowded places like offices and wedding banquets. Liaoning province in northeast China has largely brought under control the risk of social transmission of the new outbreak, Wu said. Local authorities in Heilongjiang, another northeastern province, are carrying out further tracing and case investigation after identifying multiple transmission chains, according to Wu. The Omicron-related infections in the southern city of Shenzhen have been “basically controlled,” Wu said, while the source of successive outbreaks in southwestern Yunnan province is still unclear. Ten new confirmed highly infectious Omicron cases were reported in Suzhou, Jiangsu province Monday. Nucleic acid screening is being expanded to reduce the risk of pandemic spread, Wu said. None of the current outbreaks is associated with a large-scale lockdown.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009711
Finding Comfort in Flushing,"For Chinese abroad during the pandemic, neighborhoods like Flushing have become sanctuaries.",2022-02-14,"Some of the most vivid memories from my childhood were made during the weekends I spent with my parents in Flushing. Located in Queens, New York City, Flushing seemed to my young immigrant self the antithesis of America. Signs with Asian characters hung over storefronts and faces like mine crowded the streets. It didn’t look like America at all. I found myself rejecting this place, despite the comfort it seemed to bring to my parents. I didn’t understand why we needed to make the long drive to Queens from New Jersey just to do our grocery shopping in shabby markets with wet and dirty floors, when there was a clean and brightly lit American supermarket just down the street from our house. And I didn’t understand why my mother insisted on having my hair cut at a Chinese salon located in the back of a food court when all my friends got theirs at the Supercuts back in our New Jersey suburb. How unnecessary it was, I remembered thinking to myself, for a neighborhood like this to exist in a country like America. This past December, I went home to New Jersey for the holidays. And I found myself — just like the good old days — in the backseat of my parents’ car, making the pilgrimage to Flushing. It had been over five years since I last walked down Main Street, the neighbourhood’s busiest strip, but it seemed untouched by the passage of time. And maybe it’s the fact that I’ve been missing China, which I haven’t visited in more than two years, or perhaps it’s just the natural process of growing up and learning to embrace my culture rather than to shun it, but what once seemed so “unnecessary” all of a sudden felt like home. The past two years have been difficult for the whole of humanity, but they’ve been especially trying for Asian communities around the world. Not only have border closures, strict testing requirements, and steep travel costs severed many immigrants from their home countries, but Asians living in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere have also been subjected to a disturbing rise in racist attacks, both verbal and physical. For generations, many Asians, and especially Asian Americans, have told ourselves that, if we just keep our heads down and work hard, we can avoid racism. But no amount of hard work can shield you when your adopted country’s president publicly calls a global pandemic the “China Virus.” Neighborhoods like Flushing — along with Chinatown in San Francisco, Prato in Italy, and thousands more scattered across practically every continent in the world — are increasingly important, as both communities and sanctuaries. They’ve always offered immigrants authentic Asian food and good bargains. Increasingly, however, they’re also becoming places of solace, solidarity, and protection. On their streets, you don’t worry about looking or speaking differently from everyone else. On their streets, there’s a silent but mutual understanding that the fear, confusion, and desperation you’re feeling is shared. And on their streets, those who attack and harass the vulnerable may at least suffer consequences for doing so. Far from being unnecessary, they’re vital for the preservation of identity, solidarity, and resilience.  Perhaps that’s why, on this latest trip, Flushing seemed to transform in front of my eyes. I used to find its stubborn self-reliance embarrassing, a reflection of residents’ inability to assimilate and adapt. But now, that self-reliance signals empowerment: the shops selling all kinds of unconventional Asian delicacies, the businessowners who hardly speak any English, the streets filled with smells and sounds that cannot be found anywhere else, and the pedestrians who crowd the sidewalks like they’re back home. It’s not that they’re rejecting the host country. Rather, they’re expressing a pure form of pride. At a time when one of our homes has never felt more distant, and the other never more unwelcoming, this pride is crucial. So, the shops keep selling their delicacies, the businessowners keep speaking in their mother tongues, and the streets remain as fragrant and lively as ever, filled with people who refuse to put their lives on hold despite advice to stay indoors and out of harm’s way. On my grandfather’s very first trip to New York in 1993 for work, he was put up at a hotel in Flushing. Recently, I had the chance to ask him about it, what it was like back then. “Exactly the same,” he replied. “Nothing has changed.” During periods of uncertainty, consistency can bring relief. And this is what I felt during my last visit to Flushing. Despite all the trials and tribulations of the past two years, neighborhoods like this continue to flourish and continue to be necessary. That day in December, I relished all that Flushing has to offer. I ate the street food, I chatted with the fishmonger at the market, I even got my hair cut at that salon in the back of the food court. For a brief moment, I felt like I was back in Shanghai. But it was more than nostalgia. It was a sense of pride. I am proud of Flushing the same way I am proud to be Chinese American, of my culture and heritage, and of my newly discovered voice as a member of a minority. And the best part? For a place that takes you so far away, it’s only a forty-minute drive from home.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009641
Chinese Scientists Have Designed a 4-Minute COVID-19 Test,"Polymerase chain reaction testing is currently considered the gold standard in diagnosing COVID-19, but results usually take hours.",2022-02-09,"Chinese scientists have designed a new COVID-19 test that can give results in less than four minutes with high accuracy, according to a study published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The new technology uses a device that can detect the presence of the virus’ genetic material in the form of electric signals, said the authors of the study published Monday. They said the test was capable of finding small traces of the virus in the sputum of an infected individual. “(The tool) may be advantageous in that it offers rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, easy operation, high sensitivity and specificity, and portability,” the authors said, referring to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The team, led by researchers from Shanghai’s Fudan University, ran more than 80 nasal swab samples — from people infected with COVID-19 and the flu, as well as healthy individuals — using the device, and was able to detect all 33 COVID-19 specimens in between six seconds to four minutes, depending on the viral load. Currently, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing is considered the gold standard in diagnosing COVID-19, as recognized by the World Health Organization and health authorities around the globe. However, PCR tests usually take hours to accurately detect the virus’ genetic materials in a laboratory setting. Recently, several governments have also opted to use the more convenient, at-home rapid antigen test kits, which give results in about 15 minutes. However, these tend to be less accurate than PCR tests, as they can miss detection in samples with lower viral loads. “Assays for nucleic acid testing that are simple, rapid, and ultraprecise would contribute to slowing down the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2,” the authors of Monday’s study wrote, adding their device would help “on-site and point-of-care testing in airports, clinics, local emergency departments, and even at home.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009620
Many Chinese Are Missing Another Spring Festival Reunion,Sporadic coronavirus outbreaks and strict travel guidelines have thwarted holiday plans for the third year.,2022-01-31,"SHANGHAI — There’s a saying in China that people always return home for the Spring Festival, no matter the distance. But the pandemic has changed that for many who had no choice but to cancel plans to reunite with their family for the third year in a row. With hundreds of millions of people crisscrossing the country during the peak travel season, authorities are concerned about the possible spread of COVID-19 after multiple cities reported coronavirus flare-ups over the past months. Some local governments urged residents to stay put by offering cash and other incentives, while others mandated both centralized quarantine and home isolation for those returning from “medium- and high-risk areas.” “It’s only a seven-day holiday — if I go home and need to quarantine for 14 days, it’ll delay my return to work,” Zhang Hua, who works at a private company in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. So the 33-year-old decided to miss kicking off the Year of the Tiger with his family in the central province of Henan for the third year since the start of the pandemic. He knew he had to cancel his plans when Shanghai reported multiple infections just weeks ahead of the Lunar New Year, with residents’ mobile health codes marked with an asterisk, indicating the city had medium-risk areas. “It’s almost impossible that the asterisk would be removed, so I don’t think I’d be welcomed in Henan,” Zhang said. Henan is among the provinces to report hundreds of confirmed COVID-19 infections amid the recent nationwide outbreaks that have stretched over three months. Officials in the city of Anyang, which also reported the highly transmissible Omicron infection earlier this month, said they “earnestly hoped” that residents wouldn’t come home for the holidays. Dong Hong, the mayor of Dancheng County in Henan, was quoted as saying in a viral video clip that those violating pandemic prevention rules or who had “maliciously” returned to their hometown would be quarantined and later detained. He added the move was to “ensure the safety of the people.” County officials sent oil, quilts, and coats to locals as early as Jan. 1, urging them to discourage family members from other parts of China from visiting them for the Spring Festival. One town in the county said they persuaded nearly 1,500 people to celebrate the new year “in place” with “remarkable results.”  Few eastern cities are also tempting residents with incentives to stay put, just like in previous years: Hangzhou, which is currently experiencing a local outbreak, announced 600 yuan ($95) worth of coupons for non-local migrant workers; Hefei said out of town workers in key industrial sectors would receive 1,000 yuan of “red envelope” bonuses; and Wuxi decided to either slash or exempt one month’s rent for “qualified enterprises” that accommodate its workers. However, those who have been away from home for extended periods are turning down such offers, instead opting to see their families. Several migrant workers, who mostly get time off only during the Spring Festival, told Sixth Tone earlier this month that they decided to travel home earlier than usual, fearing possible restrictions closer to the Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 1 this year. But those not returning said they felt a sense of déjà vu, as they tick off another Spring Festival against the backdrop of the pandemic — though there was less anxiety this time. An employee surnamed Wu at a Beijing-based state-owned company, remembered the frantic days ahead of the Spring Festival in 2020. At first, she was determined to travel to her hometown in the eastern province of Anhui, scrambling to look for face masks and hand sanitizers, which were all sold out, before eventually canceling her train tickets as more news about the outbreak in Wuhan started trickling in. That year, she spent the holiday alone in her apartment, video chatting with her family, and hoped to celebrate with her parents and grandparents the following year. But in 2021, with several local governments discouraging people from traveling long distances, she once again stayed in the city and spent the Spring Festival with her sister’s family. 2022 wasn’t turning out to be any different, Wu said.  This year, she again plans to spend her New Year with her sister and brother-in-law, along with her newborn niece. She hoped to visit her elderly grandparents soon, having already missed three family reunions during the most important annual holiday. “I’m worried I won’t be able to spend the New Year with them ever again,” Wu said. “I really hope to spend the next one with them.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009583
Hangzhou Quarantines Thousands as COVID-19 Dampens Spring Festival,The surge in infections has been attributed to the highly transmissible Omicron variant.,2022-01-29,"Thousands of residents in Hangzhou have been placed in centralized quarantine just days ahead of the Spring Festival, as the eastern Chinese city reported dozens of new coronavirus infections this week. The provincial capital of Zhejiang had logged 42 infections as of Saturday afternoon since the first person tested positive for the virus earlier this week, according to local health authorities. On Friday, the city reported nearly half of the country’s 37 confirmed cases. The city’s new infection cluster was traced to a local catering equipment company, Welbilt, before it spread to the community, authorities said during a press conference Friday. They added more than 9,000 people from two residential communities near the company were currently in quarantine, adding more infections were likely to be detected in the coming days. Chen, a mother of an 18-month-old child, told Sixth Tone they waited for three hours early Friday morning to be checked into a quarantine hotel. Before the cases were detected, the 26-year-old was planning to travel home to the nearby city of Wenzhou for the Spring Festival. “It was all of a sudden … I was nervous because it’s my first quarantine experience and a bit worried about my child not adapting to living in a hotel room,” Chen said. “Now we’ll just video call other family members to celebrate the festival.” A provincial health official said preliminary virus tracing indicated that a Welbilt employee was infected “through an object” before it transmitted among other employees and then to the community. He added that four of the 11 samples collected from the company’s “unused imported goods” tested positive for Omicron. “(The quarantine) is mainly due to the strong infectiousness of Omicron and the relatively high number of close contacts in the two communities, which are commercial and residential complexes,” a local government official said Friday. On Thursday, a city official urged Hangzhou residents to stay put and minimize movement for the Spring Festival celebrations, adding “necessary travel” wasn’t, however, restricted. The holiday rush started with a tense mood, as local authorities across the country have implemented stringent virus prevention measures. The outbreak in Hangzhou has so far spread to at least four other provinces, including Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guizhou, as some Welbilt employees had returned to their hometowns after commencement of the company’s Spring Festival break on Jan. 19, according to media reports. Meanwhile, Omicron infections have been found in at least 10 other cities in China and driven the global increase in cases. On Saturday, some Hangzhou residents also found their mobile health code turned from green to orange, prohibiting access to public transportation and other services amid the possibility they could have been infected. Local officials said they would get their green health code after testing negative for COVID-19 for three consecutive days.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009579
"China to Continue Strict Border Control in 2022, Official Says",The country has been largely shut off since the start of the pandemic.,2022-01-28,"China will maintain its tight border restrictions this year but avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, with authorities suggesting some curbs may likely be loosened. Chen Jie, spokesperson for the National Immigration Administration, said Thursday that immigration agencies would in time approve entry and exit applications of those seeking to study, work, and conduct business abroad, and others coming to China for trade, science, and technology-related activities, as well as urgent humanitarian reasons. He urged people to “reduce non-urgent and non-essential cross-border movement,” as global COVID-19 cases remained on the rise. “The policies can guarantee people with necessary needs to smooth travel and help build a healthy and safe environment for the movement of Chinese people and foreigners,” Chen said during Thursday’s press conference. China largely shut its border in March 2020 amid the pandemic, though some entry restrictions have since been relaxed for resident permit holders. However, its “circuit breaker” policy — the suspension of flights carrying a certain number of passengers who test positive for the virus upon arrival — and strict quarantine measures have upended the lives of many. Chinese citizens studying, living, or working abroad have found it unusually difficult to return home, while foreigners being unable to come to China has led to a shortage of foreign talent in the country. Last year, there was an annual increase of 6.6% in inbound and outbound international travel among mainland Chinese, though that figure for foreigners dropped by a whopping 65.9%, according to the administration. Zhang Wenhong, a renowned infectious diseases expert based in Shanghai, said earlier this month that “the risk of imported cases should still be very high for the next six months,” as the highly transmissible Omicron variant was spreading rapidly across the world. China has so far reported local COVID-19 cases involving the variant in at least 11 cities, while the number of daily infections has dipped to double digits.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009575
"No Proof Foreign Mail Infectious, Chinese Health Officials Say",The possibility that overseas packages could carry COVID-19 spurred cities to order recipients to get tested.,2022-01-25,"Chinese health officials have defused the hypothesis put forth by municipal governments that recent COVID-19 cases were caused by packages sent from abroad. “So far, there is insufficient evidence of non-frozen imported items leading to infection of domestic people,” said He Qinghua, a senior official at China’s ministry-level National Health Commission, during a press conference on Saturday. “Further studies should be conducted.” On Jan. 15, just weeks before the Beijing Winter Olympics kick off, China’s capital reported a COVID-19 case of the highly infectious Omicron variant — the city’s first. Puzzling municipal officials, the person had not traveled out of Beijing or come into contact with anyone infected with COVID-19 in a fortnight. They then pointed to mail the person had received from Toronto a week earlier, samples of which tested positive for Omicron. “We do not exclude the possibility of infection with the virus through imported items,” said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, during a press conference on Jan. 17. The authority urged the public to “minimize the purchase of foreign goods” to reduce the risk of transmission. That same day, authorities in Shenzhen, in southern China’s Guangdong province, said a recently identified Omicron case might be linked to international mail. The infected person had “received and opened a delivery from North America without personal protection [equipment].”  Since then, Chinese media reported some residents in Shenzhen who had received international packages had their health QR codes turn yellow. Usually the consequence of traveling to a region with an active COVID-19 outbreak, a yellow QR code limits people’s access to stores, public transport, and other facilities. Over the following days, several other Guangdong cities, including provincial capital Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Zhaoqing, required people who received international packages to get tested for COVID-19 within three days. Internationally, the suspicions cast on foreign mail were met with doubt. Canada’s health minister called the claim that the Beijing case was caused by a package from his country an “extraordinary view.” China has been battling sporadic outbreaks in port cities linked to imported frozen food. In October 2020, authorities in Qingdao found active coronavirus that could still infect and replicate once inside a host on the packing of imported frozen cod, suggesting cold chain logistics could be a transmission route of COVID-19. There is no conclusive evidence for how long the coronavirus can remain infectious on surfaces, but scientists say temperatures and materials are factors. “The virus doesn’t last long once it leaves the host’s body under regular room temperatures of around 22 to 25 degrees Celsius,” Xie Youhua, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “But during winter, especially in northern China, the temperature in which regular packages are kept before being delivered is much lower,” Xie said. He and his team found the virus on a surface could still be infectious after a week if kept in a 4 degrees Celsius environment. “But most data so far are collected from tests run in the laboratory, meaning that they don’t fully represent what’s going to happen in reality,” he added. Xie agreed with many researchers from around the world that the risk of contracting the disease from touching non-frozen goods is still small. “Getting tested every single time after receiving a package may not be a cost-effective approach,” he said. “We can disinfect packages when they’re at the customs, and it’s always a good idea to wash your hands after touching packages.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009532
Colleague Might Have COVID-19? Time for an Office Sleepover!,"As China fights a new outbreak, office workers are being called into the office for two-day quarantines.",2022-01-20,"Two years into a global pandemic, hundreds of millions of office workers around the world have adjusted to working from home. In China, some are having to try living at the office instead. Ma Mei and many of her colleagues spent last weekend quarantined in their office in Shanghai’s downtown Jing’an District after a member of staff was identified as a close contact of a person diagnosed with COVID-19. As the country fights to sustain its COVID-zero policy in the face of the Omicron variant, an increasing number of people are being summoned for office sleepovers and testing. “If a company is rich enough, I would say it isn’t that bad,” Ma told Sixth Tone. After new COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were found last Thursday, Shanghai authorities traced one of the 37-year-old office worker’s colleagues as a close contact. That person was taken to a quarantine center. Then, at midnight on Friday, Ma received a phone call ordering her to report to the office, and to avoid public transportation. Her husband gave her a ride by car. In all, more than 200 people were called back to the office to start a 48-hour period of isolation. “I had only visited the office for a few hours, but anyone who had been there in the week prior was required to come back for quarantine,” Ma said. The company prepared supplies for them: drinks, food, even video games and mahjong sets. She and her colleagues said they’d gained weight after the first day of quarantine. But Ma said it was extremely inconvenient to share just eight toilet spaces with 200-plus coworkers. “At night, every inch of the floor space was utilized for people to sleep. You literally couldn’t move a bit during sleep,” she said. “And it’s horrible not being able to take a shower two days in a row.” Other Shanghai workers have described similar experiences online. According to China’s latest national guidelines on COVID-19 control, authorities are supposed to isolate both close contacts of patients and close contacts of those close contacts. If the first degree tests negative twice, their contacts can end observation after one week. The national document doesn’t specify the locations for seven-day observation, which are left to local governments to decide. Shanghai calls its approach “2+12”: two days of “closed-loop” management, followed by 12-days of home-based health management, during which people are encouraged to stay home but not required to do so. Four nucleic tests are required throughout the process, on the first, second, seventh, and 14th days. Ma’s company-based quarantine took place during the weekend, so the time was mainly spent having fun — watching films or playing video games, mahjong, or board games. “But everyone was anxiously waiting to return home. When we learned the local authority might not be able to arrange us nucleic tests on Sunday because so many people were lining up for the tests, many of us felt devastated,” said Ma. Ma was finally tested at 3 a.m. on Monday morning, and was able to go home the same day. She’s now working from home while under home-based monitoring. Zhang Yaling, a consultant at a Shanghai company, found herself living at work during the week. “I didn’t have much sleep on the first night of the lockdown as we slept next to each other on the floor. I could hear the sounds of people snoring, walking in the corridors, and flushing the toilets,” Zhang recalled, adding, “I felt so sleepy at work the next day.” The woman and her colleagues were quarantined in November after COVID-19 cases were confirmed in their office building. She said her company brought in bedding, snacks, and nutritional supplements, in an attempt to make its trapped employees more comfortable. The employees were able to order food deliveries and shop online while being stuck in the building. Employees were still required to work in the daytime. “The collective lockdown at the office might also spawn some fun and strengthen bonds among the employees,” Zhang told Sixth Tone. “We had a good natter with other colleagues over drinks in the office, and some started playing card games like the Werewolves of Miller’s Hollow.” The practice of company-based quarantine is not unique to Shanghai, and the length of office lockdowns varies depending on local COVID-19 protocols. In the neighboring city of Hangzhou, local media reported that 14 employees of a company underwent an office lockdown in December. Wang, one of the company’s employees, filmed a few health workers bringing in bedding and toiletries to the office. He told local media that their office lockdown was extended after an initial two days. The report did not say how long the lockdown was extended. Although they played poker and table tennis, and it felt like a team-building exercise at the beginning, Wang said in the video report that “we had been in the office for days, and every morning we wake up to work. We need some time outside this space.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009505
Migrant Worker’s Contact Tracing Info Moves Chinese Masses,The 44-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19 while looking for his missing son in the capital.,2022-01-20,"The story of a fisherman who came to Beijing searching for his missing son and tested positive for COVID-19 while working odd jobs to support his family has touched millions of Chinese social media users. The man, surnamed Yue, had arrived from the city of Rongcheng in eastern Shandong province last spring after traveling to more than a dozen cities hoping to find his then 19-year-old son, missing since August 2020. The 44-year-old father of two had worked at sea to support his family of six before embarking on his search. Yue’s plight came to light after local health authorities released his movement history from Jan. 1 as part of the routine contact tracing process, a controversial practice that has sparked privacy concerns. The information released by authorities showed his work locations, most of them visited for graveyard shifts, at construction sites of trash collection centers and office buildings across the city. On microblogging platform Weibo, many users were sympathetic toward Yue, with some noting the sharp contrast compared with another person’s itinerary in Beijing who had tested positive a few days earlier. The travel history of the latter, infected with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, indicated the individual’s relatively plush lifestyle, which included multiple trips to high-end shopping malls. Yue was taken to a quarantine facility in Beijing after he tested positive for the virus Tuesday — he planned to return to Rongcheng for the Lunar New Year holidays and took the mandatory pre-departure test the day before. That same day, Yue said he had mailed a petition letter to the authorities, calling for further inquiries into his missing son’s whereabouts, according to China Newsweek magazine. The father also accused the local police station in Rongcheng for its slack probe into his son’s disappearance. Amid the media attention, authorities in Shandong said Thursday that they would investigate the case, adding they will also examine if the local police in Rongcheng had fulfilled their responsibilities. “I have been trying my best to get my child back,” Yue told China Newsweek. “I work hard. Even if I lost my life, I would do it to get him back.” On Thursday, Yue told domestic media that he had tested negative for the virus but was still in quarantine. Meanwhile, several media outlets, including state broadcaster China Central Television, had launched appeals to help the father reunite with his lost son.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009502
Xi’an Partially Lifts Lockdown as City Sees No Local COVID-19 Cases,The city of 13 million people was entirely shut down amid a surge in coronavirus cases.,2022-01-20,"Nearly a month after Xi’an placed its 13 million residents in lockdown due to a COVID-19 outbreak, the northwestern city has gradually lifted some restrictions after no new local infections were reported for a second day Wednesday. The city partially resumed public transportation in “low-risk areas” Tuesday, while trains to megacities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou restarted service. The resumption came just a day after China’s peak holiday travel season for the Lunar New Year began, though several cities have tightened restrictions amid the Omicron scare. The relaxation of restrictions comes as the historic tourist city logged zero local cases on Tuesday and Wednesday for the first time in over a month. The city recorded over 2,000 local confirmed infections since the outbreak started early December, and still had one “high-risk area” and five medium-risk areas as of Thursday. On Sunday, local authorities said some districts, counties, and economic zones had resumed daily life and production. Lockdowns in some communities were partially lifted, allowing one person per household to go out for a limited time every two or three days. The first batch of tens of thousands of college students from low-risk areas in Xi’an, home to over 60 universities and colleges, also left for their hometowns starting Sunday, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. However, some students complained online that local authorities in their hometowns required those returning from the city to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Zhang Yiran, a 24-year-old graduate student at Xi’an Jiaotong University, told Sixth Tone that they were allowed to leave their dormitory from Saturday but had to stay on campus, as the district still has a “medium-risk area.” “I felt it had been a long time since I saw so many people,” she said, referring to when she first went outside. “I’m now looking for jobs, but the lockdown has made it difficult to do in-person interviews, and that hasn’t been good. I’ll now prepare for the spring recruitment season.” Over the past few days, coronavirus cases in other parts of China have largely tapered off. But the detection of the highly transmissible Omicron variant in multiple cities is testing the country’s “zero-COVID” strategy, especially with the Spring Festival and Winter Olympics around the corner. China reported 43 domestic confirmed cases on Thursday, mostly in the central province of Henan and the port city of Tianjin, which neighbors Beijing, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, the capital reported five new local cases involving the Delta variant on Wednesday, just days after the city found its first local Omicron infection. Chinese health officials said Beijing’s only Omicron case might have contracted the virus from contaminated mail sent from Canada, though experts have questioned the theory. Authorities have asked citizens to refrain from ordering foreign goods amid the global spike in coronavirus cases, while residents in cities such as the southern tech hub of Shenzhen found that such deliveries could change the status of their mobile health passport, restricting various services. Amid recent virus flare-ups, local authorities in several cities have discouraged Spring Festival travel for the third year since the start of the pandemic, offering cash and other incentives. However, some migrant workers have snubbed such subsidies, leaving for their hometowns earlier than usual to avert possible future restrictions.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009500
"Migrant Workers Ditch Stipends Against Holiday Travel, Leave Early","Many workers have already returned home, creating labor shortages before the Lunar New Year.",2022-01-19,"Multiple cities are introducing financial incentives to convince migrant workers to stay put for the Spring Festival amid COVID-19 clusters in different parts of the country, but many weren’t prepared to spend another year apart from their families, with some even returning home earlier to skirt possible travel restrictions. He Huanqiang, who works at a factory in the eastern city of Jiaxing is one of them. He said he started driving to his hometown 2,000 kilometers away in the southwestern Sichuan province Wednesday and would pick up fellow residents from his village along the way. “I felt relieved as soon as I hit the road,” He said. To prevent possible spread of the virus during the peak travel season, local authorities in several cities have discouraged migrant workers from traveling to reunite with their families yet another year. China’s current COVID-19 outbreak has prolonged for over three months, with the local transmission of the highly infectious Omicron variant in several cities putting authorities on high alert. Authorities in the cities of Hefei, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in eastern China announced cash incentives ranging from 500 to 1,000 yuan ($80-$160) for migrant workers to stay put during the holidays. However, only workers in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors with annual revenues over 20 million yuan, and registered to their host city’s social security scheme would be eligible for the extra stipend. Meanwhile, manufacturing hubs such as Dongguan and Foshan in the southern province of Guangdong, as well Yiwu in the eastern province of Zhejiang, planned to hand out coupons and vouchers ranging from 200 to 800 yuan, which migrant workers can redeem on items and services such as film tickets and public transportation. But such initiatives haven’t convinced those unwilling to miss the holidays for the third year, disrupting their one chance to visit home every year. Multiple business owners Sixth Tone spoke with in Yiwu, Jiaxing, and Foshan said that with workers taking off earlier than before, they experienced labor shortages before the holiday. “They are afraid that a sudden outbreak will change the travel policy,” Qian Weimin, a battery manufacturer in Jiaxing, told Sixth Tone, adding two-thirds of her workers had left before the Lunar New Year travel season began this week. “They want to make the trip when it’s still possible.” Qian added that the government’s financial incentives did little to discourage travel, considering previous setbacks. When some of her workers tried to redeem the 400 yuan vouchers online last year, she said they were instead prompted to participate in a lucky draw and received less than the promised amount. “Workers wouldn’t care about several hundred yuan,” Qian said. “Those who chose to stay are here because they have no one to visit in their hometown. Their families have moved here.” In Foshan, apart from the vouchers, authorities have also encouraged enterprises to reward workers who stay put during the holidays. However, many local companies were hesitant. “A small bonus wouldn’t work at all,” Zhao Yunhai, a garment manufacturer, told Sixth Tone, adding he already pays over 8,000 yuan in monthly salaries to his employees. “If I hand out substantial bonuses, there will be no profit margin left for me.” He added that most of his 20 workers had already left last week, so he decided to shut the assembly line earlier than usual. “I hope (the workers) will be able to return right after the holiday,” Zhao said, worrying if COVID-19 outbreaks would intensify due to Lunar New Year travel.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009489
What Life Is Like for One of China’s Stranded International Students,"The author, an international student from Malaysia, reflects on spending her first three semesters of university thousands of kilometers from campus.",2022-01-17,"Next month will mark the start of my fourth semester as an international student at Nanjing University. I’m a sophomore, a journalism major, and the vice president of the Malaysian Student’s Association — and I’ve never stepped foot on campus. Although I grew up in Malaysia, I was raised surrounded by Chinese culture, and I set my mind on studying in China while I was in high school. In November 2019, I applied to Nanjing University’s undergraduate program. It’s one of China’s top schools, but I was attracted to it just as much for its location as its academic reputation: As a history-lover and a foodie, there was something appealing about studying in the capital of six dynasties, not to mention the home of soup dumplings, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and the assorted colorful desserts known as gaotuan xiaodian. It’s a pity that I haven’t been able to try any of them yet. By the time I received my acceptance letter, the world was already in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. I was quickly notified that incoming international students would not be able travel to China. Instead, we would take online classes via VooV Meeting, the international version of Tencent Video Conferencing. Our teaching assistants and professors posted the meeting details beforehand so that we could start class on time. Clearly, it wasn’t the college life I had imagined, though I have to admit that I enjoyed this way of learning, at least in the beginning. My freshman year was primarily oriented around adapting to college, and I could sleep as late as I wanted before starting my day — provided I didn’t miss any classes. Our TAs and professors did their best to help us participate. For instance, in my modern Chinese elective course, the professor worked hard to include international students in class activities, having us recite poems in our native tongues and giving us the chance to “meet” in-person students over video calls. All of those are precious, special memories. Even though our teachers all tried their best, online learning simply isn’t an enjoyable experience. Between sudden audio and video glitches and the glare of staring at my computer screen for hours on end, it was exhausting. Not to mention, there are things that just can’t be learned online. For instance, as a journalism major, we need practical training, not just the theoretical knowledge in textbooks. We are supposed to practice conducting interviews out in the field and going out with our instructors to gather news around the city. Instead, all we can do is set up a tripod in our cramped rooms, point the lens at ourselves, and start talking. Students majoring in science and engineering have it worse: They’re not sure if they can finish their growing list of lab classes by the time they’re scheduled to graduate.  Given the situation, it’s hard not to feel anxious and depressed. I was supposed to be living an exciting college life, but instead I spend every day in antiseptic online meeting rooms where the friends I should have been making and studying with are nothing but floating heads. Desperate for any taste of the college experience, I even added my Chinese classmates on the social networking app WeChat, just to get a glimpse of their lives. I also joined the school’s Malaysian Students’ Association. Our aim is to protect the rights and interests of Nanjing University’s international students and promote the university to Malaysians who are interested in studying abroad. As part of the publicity department during my freshman year, my primary responsibilities were to manage the association’s social media accounts, including answering questions about Nanjing University or posting well wishes during major holidays. While it was a massive challenge for a novice like me, it was also a good opportunity for self-enrichment and improvement. I stayed with the club my sophomore year, moving up to the position of vice president. Each month, we plan online activities to build our members’ connections and skills such as Powerpoint and networking. Though a little burdensome, the work has allowed me to meet students from across China and Malaysia, and even around the world. Perhaps it’s because we’re all “online students” — and fellow sufferers — but it feels like everyone has banded together. All the international students in our department have a WeChat group called “Homeroom Slackers,” for example, where we can share our lives or rant about our frustrations. As I enter my fourth semester of online learning, I can’t help but think whether it would be best to take a break from school. Sometimes I think to myself that it would be more practical to use this time to earn money instead of spending it on classes I can’t even attend in person. Adding to the difficulty, there hasn’t been so much as a whisper about when we might be able to arrive on campus. China still hasn’t opened up student visa applications, except for students from Korea. The Association of Graduates from Universities and Colleges of China in Malaysia has set up a task force to “push for a return to China and campus.” It is currently in communication with Malaysian agencies like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transport about sending students back to their Chinese universities. The goal is simple: to allow students at Chinese institutions to return to campus as soon as possible, but progress has been slow. Whenever I come close to giving up, however, I manage to convince myself that I can hang in a little while longer. Perhaps applications for student visas will open again in a few months. Plus, given the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia, taking time off to work would increase my risk of getting sick. And taking a year off would mean delaying graduation until I’m 25, an age when most of my peers will already be established in their careers. Over the past two years, almost no one has been living their best life, but we can’t stop trying; we have to look ahead and keep moving forward. Life must go on. There’s an English saying I really like: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” While the prospect of returning to school remains uncertain, I have still managed to make friends. Together, we’ve been through a lot, and I look forward to the day we can finally meet. Recently, I saw a post on the Chinese question-and-answer platform Zhihu saying that international students would be able to go back in March. I checked back almost every day afterwards, hoping for an update. It was a spiritual support of sorts. Then, last week, I saw that the post had been deleted. I have no way of knowing what will happen, but I haven’t lost hope.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009375
‘Returning to China Is Like Buying a Lottery Ticket’,Dozens of international flights have been canceled as the country reports a surge in COVID-19 infections among inbound passengers.,2022-01-17,"Liang has been waking up in the wee hours of the morning for almost a month — it’s not nightmares giving her sleepless nights, but the thought of whether she can return home to China soon. The 43-year-old, who only gave her surname to speak with Sixth Tone, is currently in Sweden, where she taps her phone every day, precisely at 3 a.m., when authorities release the official daily coronavirus updates in China. She has been scrambling to board a flight to attend to her ailing mother, who has cancer, but all four flights she has booked for early January have been canceled due to the country’s “circuit breaker” policy. China implemented the policy in June 2020, reducing the number of seats or temporarily suspending flights found to be carrying a certain number of passengers who test positive for the virus upon landing in the country. With COVID-19 infections spiking globally, Chinese authorities said “imported cases” have risen significantly, with Shanghai reporting the highest number since the start of the pandemic.  As of Jan. 16, the number of seats for inbound flights from North America and Western Europe scheduled during Jan. 17-30 to China dropped 43% and 21%, respectively, compared with data released Jan. 10, according to figures from air travel intelligence company OAG shared with Sixth Tone. Reuters reported that as of Jan. 12 this year, some 70 flights from the United States to China had been canceled alone. “One night my mom texted me saying her situation had worsened … and (she) probably wouldn’t make it by the time I returned to China,” said Liang, who had visited Sweden to meet her daughter. “It made me feel awful. I told her I was looking for every means to return to China, but all the flights had been canceled.” With the Lunar New Year peak travel and the Beijing Winter Olympics just weeks away, China is on high alert to ward off any large COVID-19 outbreaks. The country has reported over 3,700 domestic infections — low by global standards but a significant tally for a country still pursuing a “zero-COVID” strategy — since the latest flare-up in the northwestern city of Xi’an on Dec. 9. The highly transmissible Omicron variant that has now been detected in multiple cities, including major international entry points such as Shanghai and Beijing, has only posed further challenges to authorities. With cases on the rise globally, the strict regulation of inbound international flights is unlikely to change anytime soon, according to experts. Zhang Wenhong, a top Chinese virologist and a leading COVID-19 expert, said over the weekend that “the risk of imported cases should still be very high for the next six months.” Amid the country’s strict policies to remain virtually virus-free, the stories of students struggling to make it to schools abroad on time or workers desperately seeking to fly home after finishing their foreign tenures show the emotional toll faced by many. Chen Qing planned to fly to China next month after visiting her boyfriend in the U.S., but she said her Feb. 14 flight had already been canceled. For now, the 32-year-old has rebooked for the following week, but she’s not hopeful considering the number of passengers testing positive for the virus upon arriving in China. “I’m spending heaps of time daily checking cancellation information on social media,” Chen told Sixth Tone, adding she is concerned that her delayed departure could affect her job at home. “But there’s just nothing I can do.”  The rigid rules and the swiftly evolving situation has made overseas Chinese anxious, with many of them sharing their experiences online. While some have started online chat groups with strangers to share their plights and update each other with travel information, others have flooded social platforms such as Xiaohongshu, where they post about their failed attempts to fly home from abroad — from ordeals involving multiple flight cancellations to soaring ticket prices. Both Chen and Liang said they paid over 20,000 yuan ($3,150) for an inbound flight to China, more than double pre-pandemic prices. Many have booked through travel agents to make sure they don’t miss their chance to secure a seat. “Returning to China is like buying a lottery ticket,” said Liang. “It’s a real gamble.” For many, prospects of flights being diverted midair has only fueled their anxiety. A Delta Air Lines flight from Seattle to Shanghai last month turned around six hours into the journey, citing how the destination airport’s new rules “require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable.” The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. refuted the claim, blaming flight cancellations on staff shortages among U.S. airlines. Last week, the U.S government criticized China’s decision to cancel a growing number of flights for being “inconsistent with its obligations under the U.S.-China Air Transport Agreement.” Meanwhile, caught in between the bureaucracy and tough border controls are thousands of people — both Chinese and foreigners — hoping to reunite with family, return to school, or their jobs. But for now, Liang and Chen said that seems like an almost impossible mission, involving a series of tasks, including securing a flight, taking various pre-departure virus tests, and weathering post-arrival quarantine. “I understand China’s strategy,” said Liang, hoping the flight she booked for the fifth time on Feb. 13 takes off without a hitch. “I just feel it’s inhumane to punish everyone based on the (circuit breaker policy).” “Sometimes I feel as if I’m the virus,” Chen added.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009463
Spring Festival Travel Muted Amid COVID-19 Worries,"Expectations are up for holiday travel this year, but many travelers are rethinking plans as cities restrict travel.",2022-01-17,"The world’s largest annual human migration is off to a slow start this year, with crowds staying away from Shanghai’s railway stations as China’s Lunar New Year travel season began. Train stations are usually mobbed in the run-up to the country’s most important holiday. But in livestream footage today from Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, the city’s main railway station, it looked like an ordinary Monday. In pre-pandemic years, as many as 3 billion trips were made during the 40 days around the Lunar New Year, a time when people traditionally travel home to visit family. The holiday will take place Feb. 1 this year. China’s railway authorities estimate that a total of 280 million trips will be made by train in the next 40 days, a year-on-year increase of 28.5%. In 2020, 210 million train trips were made during the same period, while in 2019, before the pandemic began, the number was recorded at 410 million. But amid COVID-19 outbreaks and widespread limits on travel, many people are rethinking holiday plans.  On Monday, around 174,000 people will depart from railway stations in Shanghai. This number is predicted to total 9.1 million in the upcoming 40-day travel rush, 66.5% higher than last year. Local railway authorities told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper that peak travel is expected Jan. 29, when around 450,000 travelers are forecast to leave Shanghai by train. “Migrant workers heading home to the southwestern provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, the most common destinations for migrant workers in Shanghai, have planned their travel much earlier than in previous years,” The Paper quoted authorities as saying. Some students made their way to railway stations on Monday as many local schools ended their fall semester early due to the rebounding COVID-19 epidemic. The semester would normally last until Wednesday. Travelers say that while the challenge in the past was the difficulty in securing a train ticket home, now it is the uncertainty brought about by the epidemic situation. Gong Fen was preparing to board a train at Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station this morning with her 9-year-old grandson when spoken to by Sixth Tone, heading for Lianyungang in the eastern province of Jiangsu, around 500 kilometers from Shanghai. “We decided to return home earlier, fearing that pandemic control measures might get tighter,” the 63-year-old told Sixth Tone. Lianyungang currently requires people from cities where there is a medium- or high-risk area to provide a negative nucleic test result taken in the 48 hours before arrival. Since new cases were discovered on Thursday, one location in Shanghai’s Jing’an District had been declared a medium-risk zone, and the entire city had been marked by an asterisk in the national xingchengma travel history tracking system, which is used to track COVID-19 risk based on a two-week travel history. Shanghai residents are mostly coded green, the lowest level of risk, unless they have been identified as a close contact, but many cities restrict travel for anyone who has been to a city with a risk zone.  Meanwhile, China’s train ticket booking application provides the latest epidemic control measures from all destinations. Ding Xinxin, a university student in Shanghai, may not be able to travel home, as her hometown Nanjing, also in Jiangsu, adopted strict epidemic control measures. “People who have passed by Jing’an District will be placed under 14-day centralized quarantine and then seven-day home quarantine — that means I can’t spend the Lunar New Year’s Eve with my family,” she told Sixth Tone. The rules listed in the ticket booking app say that “people who have passed by areas where there has been a confirmed patient or a symptomatic case should quarantine at government-designated accommodation for 14 days and then stay at home for further observation for another week.” Ding dined in Jing’an District on Saturday. She said her plan now is to wait and hope that the district is declared COVID-free before the new year, which will probably allow her to go directly home with only a negative nucleic test result. State railway authorities told The Paper that they’ll provide more than 10.5 million train seats per day throughout the spring migration period, a 10% increase from 2019, before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. With rules that are sometimes difficult to understand, the best solution can be talking to local authorities at home. “I’ve added community workers on my social networking app to closely follow the pandemic control and prevention measures in my hometown,” said Fu Danni, who has booked a ticket Jan. 26 for her hometown in Zhejiang province, southwest of Shanghai. Railway authorities told The Paper that once the epidemic breaks out in a certain region, they’ll suspend operations or reduce the number of trains to control personnel flow.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009465
Beijing Finds City’s First Local Omicron Infection,The highly transmissible variant has been detected in at least seven Chinese cities.,2022-01-16,"Beijing has reported the city’s first locally-transmitted case involving the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, putting the Chinese capital on high alert less than three weeks ahead of the Winter Olympics. The individual neither had travel history to provinces currently facing COVID-19 outbreaks nor contacts with any of the related cases, Beijing authorities said during a press conference Saturday. The resident of Haidian District tested positive for the virus after developing an itchy throat Thursday and a fever the following day, while two others who shared the apartment tested negative for COVID-19. The only Omicron case in Beijing so far comes at a time when the city is preparing to host the Winter Olympics starting Feb. 4. The capital had already imposed tight entry restrictions amid virus flare-ups in other parts of the country, requiring visitors to carry a negative COVID-19 test taken 48 hours before their journey. Xu Hejian, director of the Information Office of Beijing Municipal Government, said the Omicron variant posed a “greater risk” in preventing and controlling the pandemic, adding that the highly transmissible variant was spreading rapidly at home and abroad. As of Sunday, at least seven Chinese cities — including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Anyang, Dalian, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan — have detected locally-transmitted Omicron infections. China reported its first Omicron case last month in an overseas returnee in Tianjin. With peak holiday travel approaching next week, authorities in Beijing said they would strengthen health monitoring of all people entering the capital and urged residents to stay put for the Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 1 this year. This is the third year that local authorities across China are discouraging holiday travel to prevent possible spread of the virus. On Saturday, China logged 65 confirmed local cases of COVID-19, with the majority in Tianjin and Henan, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, the northwestern city of Xi’an, which is in its fourth week of lockdown, only reported one coronavirus infection.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009457
Shanghai Strengthens Post-Quarantine Rules Amid Local COVID-19 Cases,The city has seen an uptick in coronavirus infections among individuals returning to the city from abroad.,2022-01-14,"Health officials in Shanghai warned those returning from abroad to strictly comply with the post-quarantine rules Thursday after the city reported five coronavirus cases linked to an individual with international travel history. The two symptomatic individuals who tested positive for the virus worked at a milk tea store in downtown Jing’an District, according to the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission. Both were close contacts of an individual who flew to Shanghai from the United States on Dec. 21. The individual had undergone a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location and tested positive Tuesday, the last day of the weeklong self-monitoring period, health authorities said. Zeng Qun, deputy head of Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said during a press conference Thursday that the city would strengthen measures for international returnees during their self-monitoring period at home. During the weeklong isolation, such individuals are banned from using public transportation, walking around their neighborhoods, and going to crowded places such as movie theaters and restaurants. “For the very few violations of the provisions, we will take serious disciplinary measures in accordance with the law,” Zeng said. On Thursday, Shanghai also reported three asymptomatic infections — such cases are, however, not included in the country’s COVID-19 tally — linked to the same transmission chain. Local health authorities said that four of the five patients were fully vaccinated, although it’s unclear if they had received booster shots. As one of China’s busiest entry points for international arrivals, Shanghai has a relatively lenient quarantine policy compared with other cities. But health experts have called for strengthening the city’s defense against the virus, as the Omicron variant drives the global COVID-19 surge. Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease expert tasked with managing Shanghai’s coronavirus response, said there was an influx of “imported cases” in the city’s dedicated COVID-19 hospital — the highest since the start of the pandemic in 2020. “We are still at the most difficult time in our battle against Omicron,” Zhang wrote on his Weibo microblogging account on Thursday, though it’s unclear if the local cluster was linked to the highly transmissible variant. “The best strategy for China is to maintain its strategy and be patient … Eventually (we’ll) get through the pandemic with an extremely low death rate and gradually return to normal.” Amid an uptick in coronavirus cases among passengers who returned from abroad, multiple cities, including Shanghai, have canceled several international flights under the country’s “circuit breaker” policy. Some 70 flights from the U.S. to the Chinese mainland have been canceled this year alone, according to Reuters. On Thursday, China reported 143 confirmed local COVID-19 cases, with the majority in the central province of Henan and the northern port city of Tianjin. Infections in Xi’an remained in single digits, as the northwestern city entered its fourth week of lockdown.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009446
Chinese Expert: ‘TCM Will Play Greater Role in Treating Omicron’,Attention to traditional Chinese medicines renewed as Tianjin reported dozens of breakthrough infections.,2022-01-12,"Chinese health experts have reemphasized the role of traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, in combating COVID-19 at a time when several fully vaccinated people were found to be infected with Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the northern city of Tianjin. “TCM will play a greater role in treating Omicron, which is based on our previous clinical experience of treating patients overseas,” Zhang Boli, a member of an expert group at the National Health Commission and president of the Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said during a press conference Tuesday. “The patients turn negative relatively faster, and the chance of it developing into a severe disease is lower.” In a separate interview with state-run Xinhua News Agency the same day, Zhang added that authorities have also prescribed additional TCMs “targeting the new features of Omicron.” Chinese officials have promoted the use of TCM against COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic in 2020, though some experts questioned its effectiveness. Last year, authorities also said the country plans to build several “inheritance and innovation” centers to study the use of TCM in treating and preventing epidemics. Discussions on using TCM to treat COVID-19 come amid dozens of breakthrough infections in Tianjin, where fully vaccinated people tested positive for the coronavirus. Local authorities said all but one of the 80 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the city were vaccinated — while the only unvaccinated patient was a child, 76 were fully vaccinated, 20 of them boosted, and three of them had received their first shot. In the wake of an ongoing virus surge, Chinese health authorities have encouraged citizens to get their booster shots. A study published by Chinese experts in December showed booster shots — either using different technologies than the first two doses or the same kind of vaccine — could reduce severe disease and mortality caused by the highly transmissible virus, though the country hasn’t greenlighted the mix-and-match approach. However, the World Health Organization’s Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition on Tuesday said that “repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable” against the new variants. The group added that the current vaccines may need to be updated to provide continued protection against Omicron and other future variants. On Tuesday, China logged 166 confirmed local COVID-19 infections, with the majority of cases in the central province of Henan and Tianjin, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, infections in the northwestern city of Xi’an, which is in its third week of lockdown after a virus surge, dropped to single digits.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009433
Tianjin Tightens Restrictions After Finding Local Omicron Spread,The city of 14 million has partially locked down residential communities and shut schools as it plans to mass test residents.,2022-01-10,"Nearly a month after China detected its first Omicron variant of the coronavirus in a foreign returnee in Tianjin, the northern port city is facing the country’s first locally-transmitted cases involving the heavily mutated and highly transmissible virus. A 10-year-old girl and a 29-year-old woman working at an after-school center were found to be infected with the variant, local authorities announced Saturday. Tianjin logged 31 confirmed local COVID-19 cases as of Monday evening, with many of the symptomatic cases found among primary and middle school students. It’s unclear where the two patients were infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, as authorities said they hadn’t left Tianjin in the past two weeks. They were found to be infected with the BA.1 sub lineage of Omicron, different from the country’s first Omicron case reported in the city in December. The city, just over 100 kilometers from Beijing, where the Winter Olympics start next month, said Sunday it would start testing its 14 million residents for the virus. “I couldn’t test on Sunday after lining up for four hours, and finally made it on Monday,” a 25-year-old woman surnamed Xia told Sixth Tone. Amid the fresh outbreak, the Tianjin government urged residents not to leave the city, adding those who need to travel must conduct a nucleic acid test 48 hours prior to their journey and have a green health code. Authorities have also partially locked down residential communities and shut schools to prevent further spread of the virus. Zhang Ying, deputy director of the local COVID-19 prevention and control team in Tianjin, said in a press conference Saturday that the current cases indicate “the virus has been transmitting for at least three generations,” meaning the transmission might have started earlier than previously known. On Monday, the city of Anyang in central Henan province also reported two COVID-19 patients infected with the Omicron variant. Local authorities believed the infections were linked to the same transmission chain from Tianjin after a university student who returned from the northern city tested positive for the virus. China logged 97 locally transmitted COVID-19 infections on Sunday, with the majority in Henan and Tianjin, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, the northwestern city of Xi’an, which is in its third week of lockdown after a virus surge, reported 15 cases, and one infection was found in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen. This story has been updated with latest COVID-19 cases from Tianjin.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009410
"After Tragedies, Xi’an Promises Better Health Care Amid Lockdown",Chinese vice premier said she “deeply grieved” for the residents affected by delayed medical treatment.,2022-01-07,"Authorities in the northwestern city of Xi’an said Friday that hospitals weren’t allowed to turn away patients seeking medical treatment, even amid the strict coronavirus-related protocols, following multiple incidents that led to loss of lives. The municipal government said health care facilities must accept patients regardless of having a negative COVID-19 test result, apologizing for the tragedies that unfolded over the past days. Xi’an was placed in strict lockdown on Dec. 23 following a surge in infections, one of China’s worst outbreaks since the early days of the pandemic. On Sunday, a 61-year-old man died after failing to seek timely medical attention, his daughter Wang Xin told Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, using a pseudonym. After her father experienced sudden chest pain, instead of rushing him to the hospital, she had to first seek approval from her residential community and then call an inundated ambulance hotline number, before driving herself. After reaching the Xi’an International Medical Center Hospital, Wang said her father was denied medical care for over seven hours because they lived in a “medium-risk” COVID-19 zone, and he didn’t have a negative nucleic acid test result. By the time he received treatment, it was already too late. “After my dad was pushed out (on the stretcher), I just broke down, because he was a living person when he went in,” Wang told The Paper. Wang’s plight is among the multiple medical tragedies that have shocked and angered many of the city’s 13 million people, who have been placed in strict lockdown for over two weeks. Though the number of COVID-19 infections has gradually declined over the past few days, authorities said the restrictions will continue until the city stamps out the virus entirely. On Thursday, China’s Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said she “deeply grieved” for those who experienced tragedies, demanding improvements to the problems exposed in local coronavirus response, according to the state-owned Xinhua News Agency. Sun said hospitals should not “turn away patients under any pretense during COVID-19” as “the primary function of a medical institution is to provide medical care.” Since Xi’an implemented the lockdown, residents have shared their experiences, including challenges in accessing non-coronavirus-related medical services, angering locals and others. Last week, two pregnant women lost their respective children after they were barred from entering hospitals. One didn’t have a negative virus test as required, while the other couldn’t provide an eligible electronic health code. On Thursday, local health authorities dismissed several staff from the Xi’an Gaoxin Hospital, where one of the pregnant women had sought medical attention. The director of the city’s health commission also received a warning for “dereliction of duty” along with other officials.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009400
"With Another Outbreak in Henan, China Battles to Beat the Virus",The country’s latest coronavirus flare-up has dragged on for nearly three months.,2022-01-06,"As the number of COVID-19 infections in the northwestern city of Xi’an gradually declines, dozens of cases in a neighboring province have posed challenges for authorities to contain the virus surge that has prolonged for nearly three months.  Six cities in the central Henan province logged 64 of the country’s 132 locally transmitted infections on Wednesday, according to the National Health Commission. The city of Xuchang reported 50 confirmed cases, with others detected in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Zhoukou, Shangqiu, and Gushi. The infections in Xuchang were discovered just days after the city of Yuzhou placed more than 1 million residents in lockdown Monday over three asymptomatic carriers. Local authorities in Xuchang, which administers Yuzhou, had promised the latter provision of 5,000 rooms for centralized quarantine in case of a surge in infections. As of Thursday afternoon, Xuchang hadn’t announced any restrictions other than discouraging residents from leaving the city. Meanwhile, COVID-19 infections in Xi’an dropped to double digits for the fourth day Wednesday, as the provincial capital of Shaanxi province reported 65 locally transmitted confirmed cases, according to the official tally. Local authorities said the city’s new cases were only detected among people either in isolation centers or sealed-off residential areas with prior infections. “If Xi’an wants to lift the lockdown, it must first achieve zero cases in communities,” Chen Zhijun, deputy director of Xi’an Disease Control and Prevention Center said during a press conference Tuesday. Xi’an has been battling China’s worst coronavirus outbreak since the early days of the pandemic in 2020 and has placed 13 million residents in lockdown for two weeks. Over the past days, anxious residents have complained of difficulties securing food supplies and even medical services for ailments other than COVID-19. After reports of a pregnant woman losing her baby due to a delay in receiving medical attention, Xi’an authorities on Thursday ordered local hospitals not to reject patients due to COVID-19 concerns. Officials dismissed an undisclosed number of personnel from their positions at the Xi’an Gaoxin Hospital, where the woman had sought medical treatment. The Xi’an government has also suspended the director of the city’s big data center for “dereliction of duty.” The Xi’an Big Data Resources Administration was responsible for managing the city’s health code app, which crashed during the early days of the outbreak, disrupting daily activities for locals.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009387
Xi’an Residents Anxious as City Enters Day 13 of COVID-19 Lockdown,"Coronavirus infections are gradually slowing down, though there are no signs of immediate relaxation to the curbs imposed to prevent its spread.",2022-01-04,"As the northwestern city of Xi’an entered its 13th day of lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, residents shared anguished stories similar to those that emerged during the initial outbreak in early 2020. Several residents complained online of the difficulties in securing food supplies, even after local authorities promised free door-to-door food delivery on Dec. 28, five days after they were placed in lockdown. Though food delivery workers are allowed to operate, many said the food delivery platforms were either out of stock or there were no couriers available. At many of the city’s hospitals, locals with non-coronavirus-related ailments struggled to receive proper medical treatments, according to domestic media reports. As hospitals largely remain under strict COVID protocols, there were reports of kidney patients struggling to access dialysis treatment, a pregnant woman unable to find a hospital for delivery, and — via a screenshot of a now deleted social media post that went viral — a man who died of heart attack after not being able to receive timely treatment. Some stories evoked memories from the strict lockdown in the central city of Wuhan nearly two years ago. At that time, the city’s 14 million people were unable to leave their homes for 76 days, and people struggled to continue with their daily lives as authorities battled to contain the virus. Responding to complaints over dwindling food supplies, local authorities said over 3,400 tons of vegetables were sourced from neighboring provinces and cities as of Saturday, according to media reports. Xi’an officials also promised to set up community health care services and emergency hotlines to assist those requiring medical attention. After a week of logging more than 100 daily cases, the coronavirus infections in Xi’an are gradually tapering off, though the city still accounts for the majority of the national caseload. As of Monday, the historic tourist city and capital of Shaanxi province registered 1,758 COVID-19 infections since the recent outbreak started on Dec. 9. Over the past week, police in Xi’an have also arrested and fined three men for returning to their villages to evade the lockdown and save hotel quarantine costs, domestic media reported. While one of the men reportedly walked 100 kilometers through the Qinling Mountains, another biked for 10 hours in the winter night, and the third swam across an icy river. Amid criticisms over its stringent virus control measures affecting the city’s migrant workers and economically disadvantaged groups, Xi’an municipal government on Monday said they have accommodated over 200 stranded people in temporary shelters and spent around 6 million yuan ($1 million) on relief funds to help more than 8,000 people. On Monday, the city of Yuzhou in neighboring Henan province also placed over 1 million residents in lockdown after discovering three asymptomatic carriers, which China doesn’t include in its daily COVID-19 tally. The province found confirmed local infections in the cities of Xuchang and Luoyang that same day, while one case was reported in Zhengzhou, according to the National Health Commission. Meanwhile, the coastal city of Ningbo in the eastern Zhejiang province has reported 24 confirmed local cases since Saturday, including a cluster at a clothing factory in Beilun District, home to some of its busiest container terminals. Gene sequencing showed 10 factory workers were infected with a mutated Delta variant that has been widely spreading in Vietnam and was unrelated to the previous outbreak in December, domestic media reported.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009361

Xi’an Tries to Contain Surging COVID-19 Cases and Swelling Rumors,The city of 13 million has been under lockdown for nearly a week.,2021-12-29,"Authorities in Xi’an are scrambling to contain the coronavirus flare-up as the northwestern city logged more than 100 infections for the fourth consecutive day, just weeks before the start of the peak holiday season in the country. The capital of Shaanxi province has logged nearly 1,000 confirmed local cases since the first infection was detected on Dec. 9, of which 631 were reported between Saturday and Tuesday, according to the provincial health commission. The outbreak has resulted in China’s highest COVID-19 cases since the country largely stamped out the virus in early 2020 and vowed a “zero-COVID” policy. On Tuesday, all but one of the confirmed local COVID-19 cases were reported in Xi’an. The other infection was found in the eastern city of Nanjing, which also experienced an outbreak over the summer. In Xi’an, the city’s 13 million people have been placed under lockdown since the midnight of Dec. 23, similar to the measures implemented in the central city of Wuhan during the early days of the pandemic. Medical experts attributed the swift viral transmission in Xi’an to mostly asymptomatic carriers or patients with mild symptoms, delaying detection. “The recent outbreak has the characteristics of ‘hidden transmission,’” Shi Bingyin, former dean of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiao Tong University, told a local media outlet. “Most of the patients were discovered through mass testing instead of them going to hospitals after discovering symptoms.” Amid rising infections, residents have voiced dissatisfaction over the local government’s handling of the infections. While some questioned the effectiveness of disinfecting large swathes of the city, others complained about the disruption in delivery services due to the lockdown. Meanwhile, rumors that the city had set up Wuhan-like temporary hospitals and officials forced residents to join disease control-related tasks due to lack of staff had widely circulated online. Local authorities said they are actively using a dedicated website to debunk rumors and misinformation. Police have detained an unspecified number of people for spreading false information, including an individual who posted false information about the source of the current outbreak, according to domestic media reports. As of Tuesday, six people were also detained for insulting disease control personnel.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009329
"Boosters May Offer Protection Against Omicron, Chinese Study Says","Researchers said mixing COVID-19 vaccines for the third dose better neutralized the new variant, though authorities haven’t yet greenlighted the approach.",2021-12-24,"Booster shots that use different technologies than the first two doses could improve vaccine-induced immune protection against the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus, a new study by Chinese researchers suggested. A third heterologous protein subunit vaccine following two doses of inactivated vaccines could provide better protection against Omicron than using the latter as a booster shot, according to the paper published Wednesday by the National Medical Center for Infectious Diseases at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital of Fudan University. The study is China’s first peer-reviewed paper on the effectiveness of vaccine boosters against Omicron. Researchers suggested that Omicron is more likely to evade immunity than other COVID-19 strains, adding that a third shot — either using the same technology or a mix and match approach — could protect against severe disease and mortality caused by the variant. “Vaccine boosters can enhance the immune barrier, but cannot completely stop the spread of Omicron,” researchers said in a separate article Thursday. “Currently, the best strategy to form an immune barrier against Omicron worldwide is to intensify public health and social measures and get a third booster shot.” The study echoes research results from the United Kingdom and Hong Kong that suggested Omicron can escape immune response from a double-dose regimen, while a booster shot can increase protection against it. Since it was first detected in November, the Omicron variant has “raised serious concerns due to multiple mutations, reported significant immune escape, and unprecedented rapid spreading speed,” Wednesday’s study said. The variant has now spread to at least 106 countries and regions, with at least seven cases detected in the Chinese mainland as of Saturday. Meanwhile, international studies have recently found Omicron cases are less likely to result in hospitalizations compared with the Delta variant, while scientists have warned the severity of the new variant is not yet fully understood. With China detecting several Omicron cases amid prolonged waves of infections, cities across the country are urging residents to get boosted using the same type of vaccine previously administered. Authorities haven’t yet greenlighted mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines, though there have been signals that China may introduce booster shots with different technical routes to enhance immunity. “It remains to be seen whether the mix-and-match approach can be supported by more data,” an immunologist from a leading Chinese university, who requested anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media, told Sixth Tone. “Mixing vaccines would increase the kinds of vaccine ingredients we are exposed to, adding to safety concerns.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009302
Xi’an on Lockdown as COVID-19 Cases Exceed 200,The city of 13 million is the latest cluster to prolong the country’s coronavirus surge.,2021-12-23,"The northwestern city of Xi’an was placed under lockdown midnight Wednesday, as coronavirus infections climbed for the fourth straight day, causing many to experience déjà vu from the pandemic’s early days when authorities sealed off entire cities. The provincial capital of Shaanxi has reported 227 confirmed local infections since the first case in the current wave was identified Dec. 9, according to the provincial health commission. Of them, 199 infections were reported between Sunday and Thursday morning. Amid the spike in infections, authorities in Xi’an have ordered the city’s 13 million people to stay at home and avoid unnecessary travel. Only one person per household in communities with no infections is allowed to leave to purchase household goods every two days. Transportation services within the historic walled city, including long-haul buses, have been suspended. The city has canceled all domestic flights starting Thursday, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper. Residents said they learned of the lockdown from the government press conference Wednesday afternoon, giving them little time for essential shopping. Videos circulating on microblogging platform Weibo showed locals panic buying at supermarkets, with some users saying the crowds seemed “risky” considering the uptick in cases. Wang Pili, a local resident, told Sixth Tone that people inundated the supermarkets after the lockdown announcement, adding she was able to buy food supplies to last for about five days. “When we heard of the lockdown, everyone panicked at first,” Wang said. “But then we realized there are enough supplies at supermarkets … Having experienced last year's pandemic, we can basically respond calmly now.” Another Xi’an resident surnamed Wang told Sixth Tone that his neighborhood had been under lockdown since Friday after an infection was detected. He has had to rely on an individual vendor for food and vegetable delivery since. “The person now said he can’t go out after the lockdown,” the 27-year-old said. “Our only hope has vanished. What can I do?” Earlier this week, citydwellers complained that the provincial health app crashed, disrupting daily activities, as the color-coded system is required to enter almost all public and private venues, as well as board public transportation. The “One Code Pass” app was inaccessible for most of Monday, as locals flooded the system to make appointments for COVID-19 tests and view their results. Shaanxi introduced some of the strictest measures last month to prevent potential coronavirus spread. The provincial government instituted a minimum 14-day quarantine for domestic travelers entering from “medium- and high-risk” areas or places with at least one confirmed or asymptomatic infection. China’s current wave of coronavirus infections that started in mid-October after a tourist couple tested positive in Xi’an has led to multiple unrelated outbreaks across the country. The border areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Zhejiang, as well as Shanghai, have seen an uptick in cases in the past months, though they have now been largely contained.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009290
Xi’an Residents Report Health App Crashes Amid Virus Surge,The historic walled city has reported the majority of coronavirus infections nationwide in the past few days.,2021-12-22,"Residents in the northwestern city of Xi’an complained that their mobile QR codes, which serve as a virtual health passport, crashed after an uptick in COVID-19 this week, disrupting daily activities.  The sudden increase in locals accessing the “One Code Pass” app used to register and view the results of their nucleic acid tests in Shaanxi province, where Xi’an is the provincial capital, led to the system’s crash Monday morning, according to domestic media reports. The inbuilt health code, required to gain access to most public and private venues, also crashed simultaneously. Xi’an has emerged as the latest coronavirus hotspot in China, with the historic city logging 52 of the 57 confirmed local infections reported nationwide on Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission. The city has recorded 143 confirmed local cases since the first infection in the latest wave that was identified on Dec. 9. On Sunday evening, the municipal government in Xi’an ordered local residents to show proof of a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test taken within the past 48 hours to enter public venues, including their workplaces. The announcement led tens of thousands in the city of over 12 million people to line up outside testing centers in subzero temperatures Sunday night. However, they were unable to retrieve their test results when the health app crashed the next morning, barring them from taking public transport or going to work. A local resident surnamed Yang told Sixth Tone that staff at the city’s subway stations were photographing the commuters’ identity cards after the health app crashed, resulting in long lines. He added that people had to wait for hours just to enter a station. “During the special period of mass testing, we recommended the public to not open the code if not necessary,” Liu Jun, director of Xi’an Big Data Resources Administration, said at a press conference Monday afternoon. The response drew flack online, with many criticizing the local government’s evasive attitude to the self-contradictory policy, though the issue was fixed by the end of the day Monday. “Who would open the code if not requested? The main task (for the government) now is to enhance the system’s capacity,” one user wrote on the microblogging platform Weibo. The cluster in Xi’an has prolonged China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, lasting over two months so far. Though the spike in infections in other provincial-level areas, including Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, have largely been brought under control, the country is grappling to eliminate the virus as part of its zero-COVID strategy. On Monday, the National Health Commission announced new policies to prevent possible spread of the virus during the Lunar New Year travel rush starting next month. The country’s top health authority advised people from cities with medium- and high-risk areas to avoid traveling, or have a negative nucleic acid test taken within 48 hours before their journey.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009285
"China Finds Omicron Cases in Tianjin, Guangzhou",Detection of the highly mutated variant comes amid rising infections in several parts of the country.,2021-12-14,"An overseas returnee has been identified as the first individual in the Chinese mainland to be infected with the highly mutated Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which has caused concerns globally since it was first detected last month.  The Chinese national arrived in the northern city of Tianjin from the Philippines on Dec. 8 and tested positive for the virus four days later, local authorities said Monday. Gene sequencing showed the patient was infected with the Omicron variant and was transported to an isolation center at a designated hospital. On Tuesday afternoon, another overseas returnee was detected with the Omicron variant in Guangzhou, domestic media reported. The individual arrived in the southern city on Nov. 27 and tested positive for the virus two weeks later while undergoing home quarantine. Since scientists in South Africa alerted the world to the variant in late November, Omicron cases have spread to 60 countries and regions, according to Reuters. The World Health Organization said the variant poses a “very high” risk to countries worldwide, though data on the severity of its symptoms is lacking. China’s top health authority, the National Health Commission, said late last month that some evidence suggested the Omicron variant can evade vaccine protection. A non-peer-reviewed study published Friday by the University of Oxford found that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Omicron cases was “significantly lower than with the Delta variant,” though an additional third shot offered more protection against mild and severe diseases. On Thursday, Chinese pharmaceutical company Brii Biosciences said it was working with laboratories in other parts of the world to test its drugs against Omicron and will likely have results in about two weeks. Last week, Chinese authorities approved the same cocktail drug, an antibody therapy, as the country’s first COVID-19 treatment. China is currently trying to contain a domestic outbreak that has lasted for almost two months. The most recent cluster in the eastern Zhejiang province has been attributed to the AY.4 sub-lineage of the Delta variant with “higher transmission, high viral load, and stronger pathogenicity.” This story has been updated.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009202
Zhejiang Tightens Restrictions as COVID-19 Cases Exceed 100,"Just as infections gradually tapered off in the north, eastern cities have turned into virus hotspots.",2021-12-13,"A new COVID-19 cluster in the eastern Zhejiang province has further extended China’s latest wave of virus flare-ups, which has now lasted nearly two months. Over the last seven days, the cities of Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Hangzhou had reported 138 confirmed cases and one asymptomatic infection — China doesn’t include the latter in its national tally — provincial health authorities said during a press conference Sunday. The three cities logged 74 of the 80 locally transmitted confirmed cases Sunday, with most cases concentrated in Shaoxing and Ningbo, respectively. Sun Liming, deputy director of Zhejiang Health Commission, said the province will implement strict control over social gatherings, cultural events, and conferences. Officials are urging residents to limit family gatherings to 10 people, while restricting indoor entertainment venues and restaurant dining to a 50% capacity. Authorities said the infections in Shaoxing and Ningbo were largely attributed to separate gatherings, and identified as having been caused by the AY.4 sub-lineage of the Delta variant with “higher transmission, high viral load, and stronger pathogenicity.” The first 18 people to test positive for the virus in Shaoxing had all attended a funeral, while multiple infections in Ningbo were found to be linked with a moxibustion center. In the wake of the outbreak in Zhejiang, the neighboring city of Shanghai has suggested residents to avoid travel and family gatherings during the Lunar New Year, which this year falls between the end of January and early February. This will be the third consecutive year that officials have urged for a subdued celebration of China’s most important holiday, when hundreds of millions of people return home for family reunions.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009197
China Approves Its First COVID-19 Drug for Use,"The antibody therapy, which was developed by a Chinese startup, was found to reduce coronavirus patients’ risk of hospitalization and death by 78% in international trials.",2021-12-09,"A domestically developed COVID-19 drug was approved for use by Chinese authorities Wednesday, making it the first treatment for the novel coronavirus to receive regulatory approval in the country. The antibody therapy — known as BRII-196/BRII-198 — was developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Brii Biosciences in partnership with scientists at Beijing’s Tsinghua University and the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen. The drug, which is administered by intravenous injection, has been approved to treat adults and minors aged 12 to 17 with mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19, according to China’s National Medical Products Administration. During an international trial involving more than 800 patients from countries including the United States, Brazil, South Africa, and the Philippines, BRII-196/BRII-198 was found to reduce COVID-19 patients’ risk of hospitalization and death by 78%, according to Brii Biosciences. Peer-reviewed data has yet to be published. The drug uses monoclonal antibodies — lab-made molecules that bind to specific spots on the coronavirus’ spike proteins — to impair the virus’ ability to invade human cells, slowing down infection. Brii Biosciences said trials indicated BRII-196/BRII-198 was effective against the Delta variant. Global pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology have developed a similar antibody treatment known as GSK-Vir, which early-stage trial data suggests is effective against all Omicron mutations. The drug was approved for use in the United States in May. To date, China has announced no plans to import COVID-19 treatments.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009176
The West Now Has New COVID-19 Cures. How About China?,Drugs designed for the coronavirus could make infections less severe. Will they allow the country to open back up?,2021-12-08,"To China’s pharmaceutical industry, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a trial by fire. Long lagging behind Western counterparts, the greatest medical emergency of a lifetime has seen it make strides, to date producing seven COVID-19 vaccines and bringing more to clinical trials. And now that the pandemic is entering a new phase, with Western pharmaceutical companies recently receiving emergency approval for COVID-19-specific treatments that stop infections from leading to severe disease, their counterparts in China are, again, not far behind. Two Chinese drug makers say they are close to bringing intravenous antibody treatments to market, and the country’s scientists are also racing to design oral pills, with a few such drugs currently in trials.  How effective they will be — especially against the recently discovered Omicron variant and other possible future mutations — is not yet clear, but they hold the promise to significantly lower the strain on medical resources as well as the public health risks of a possible loosening of China’s strict border controls. On Saturday, Chinese respiratory expert and government advisor Zhong Nanshan listed effective drugs as one of the factors necessary for China to “return back to normal.” Up until recently, doctors treating COVID-19 patients had mostly relied on existing drugs that were originally designed to treat other diseases, testing dozens of candidates with at best limited results. In laboratory experiments, HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir were found to be able to prevent the coronavirus from replicating. They were widely used until the WHO in July announced human trials had shown they had “little or no” effect on COVID-19 patients. China too stopped recommending their use. Similarly, Ebola and Hepatitis C antiviral remdesivir enjoyed early popularity but has yielded inconsistent results in clinical trials. Seeing whether existing drugs work against a new disease is taking a chance, with the upside being you might get an officially approved treatment relatively quickly, says Ding Sheng, dean of School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Tsinghua University. “But the chance of [an old medicine] working successfully on a new disease is very low,” he tells Sixth Tone. “It’s like trying a key you already have on a new lock.”  Antibody treatments But at the same time, pharmaceutical companies around the world have worked to find a cure specifically for COVID-19. In recent months, the U.S. and U.K. have authorized treatments using monoclonal antibodies, lab-made molecules that bind to specific spots on the coronavirus’ spike protein, impairing its ability to invade human cells and thus slowing down an infection. This class of drugs includes sotrovimab, made by British GlaxoSmithKline and American Vir Biotechnology, and REGEN-COV, which is made by U.S.-based Regeneron. They have shown to be able to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by at least 70% if taken relatively soon after infection. In later, more severe stages of COVID-19, most complications arise from the body’s immune system attacking the body itself, which antibody treatments cannot alleviate. The frontrunner in China’s race for a COVID-19 cure is an antibody therapy called BRII-196/BRII-198. It is being developed by domestic pharmaceutical company Brii Biosciences and a team led by the country’s top virologist, Zhang Linqi at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Composed of two types of monoclonal antibodies, the medicine should be administered via intravenous infusion and be given within 10 days from when symptoms of COVID-19 first appear. In October, Briii Biosciences announced that in a large-scale human trial involving over 800 patients in multiple countries including the U.S., Brazil, and South Africa, the therapy reduced death and hospitalization by 78% among people who are at risk of developing severe COVID-19, such as seniors or those with preexisting health conditions. Detailed data is yet to be published in an academic journal.  The company applied for an emergency use permit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October. The team has also submitted their application to the Chinese regulator, and they hope to secure domestic approval in December. “It could happen any day now,” Zhang says. “This could be the first COVID-19 cure approved in China, so it is important both practically and symbolically.” Update: On Wednesday, Chinese authorities authorized BRII-196/BRII-198 for people aged 12 and above. The BRII-196/BRII-198 antibody therapy has recently been given to hundreds of COVID-19 patients in China under compassionate use during outbreaks in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou and eastern city of Nanjing, Zhang says. This use, outside of a clinical trial, did not give any insights into its effectiveness, however. Most patients in the foreign trials had been infected with the highly infectious Delta variant, Zhang says. In preparation for new virus variants, such as Omicron, Zhang says his lab has a stockpile of promising antibody candidates in case the current treatment needs to be updated. A Beijing-based pharmaceutical start-up, Singlomics, is working on a similar therapy in collaboration with researchers at Peking University. The treatment consists of only a single type of antibody named DXP604 that also binds to the coronavirus’ spike protein. The therapy is being tested among a small number of domestic volunteers in a phase two trial, according to Shi Qian, Singlomics’ CEO. He adds that the company plans to roll out large scale phase three trials overseas, where there are more patients. Shi tells Sixth Tone that DXP604 is highly potent and has the potential to work on “nearly all existing and future virus variants,” because it binds to a place on the virus’ spike protein that, if mutated, would also decrease its ability to bind to and enter into human cells. Detailed data has yet to be published. Zhang, the virologist working on the BRII-196/BRII-198 therapy, says that while it’s possible for an antibody to work on all variants in the lab, how well it works in humans can only be tested through large-scale clinical trials. Other researchers have also cast doubt on the feasibility of a “mutation resistant” antibody. Several worrisome virus variants, including Delta and the newly emerged Omicron, all have mutations on their spike proteins but continue to invade human cells — and possibly do so even more efficiently. Most antibody therapies solve this problem by combining two different antibodies, which also boosts potency. “It’s basically a math problem,” says Wang Jun, a pharmacology professor at the University of Arizona. “If you can have 10 or even 20 different antibodies in your drug, you’ll likely get better protection against variants, because there’s a higher chance that some of the binding spots on the virus stay unchanged and the drug remains effective.” But mixing more antibodies together requires a more complex drug design, Wang tells Sixth Tone, and the already expensive treatment would become more unaffordable. DXP604 having only a single antibody, Shi says, “could significantly lower the price.” He adds that one dose of DXP604 — enough for one treatment — costs around 1,000 yuan ($157) to produce. Sotrovimab is priced at over $2,000 in the U.S.  Antivirals Another possible way to treat COVID-19 is with antivirals. Instead of preventing the coronavirus from entering human cells, antivirals are designed to block the virus from replicating and spreading to other cells. Experts say safe and effective antiviral pills for COVID-19 would be the real game-changer, because doctors only need to prescribe the drugs to patients, who can then take them themselves at home, drastically reducing pressure on hospitals. Antiviral pills also tend to cost less to make, allowing them to reach more people. “In the vast majority of scenarios, oral antiviral pills have an absolute advantage over antibody therapies,” says Ding, the Tsinghua professor, who is also the director of Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, a non-profit research organization. On Nov. 30, a U.S. expert panel recommended the FDA to authorize molnupiravir, an oral antiviral pill for COVID-19 developed by Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, despite trial data showing the drug only cuts the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 by 30%, much lower than what preliminary data suggested.  “The efficacy of this product is not overwhelmingly good,” The New York Times quoted David Hardy, an infectious disease physician in Los Angeles who’s on the expert committee. He nevertheless voted to authorize the drug, saying “there is a need for something like this.” Last month, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced its antiviral pill, named paxlovid, cuts the risk of hospitalization and death by 89% when given within three days after COVID-19 symptoms start, although detailed data is yet to be published. Chinese drug makers are a step behind when it comes to antiviral pills, but several experimental drugs are in early stage human trials, including two candidates designed by Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. While the treatments are already being developed at unprecedented speed — usually a drug could take a decade to make — Ding says support from China’s central government is still lacking. “Novel drug discovery and development is a high-risk business,” he says. “Because you are actually exploring something unknown, you’ll run into failures on the way. So greater investments can truly accelerate the exploration process.” Purchasing unproven drugs in advance, a strategy used by several western countries, could offer great help, he adds.  Vaccines are paramount Even after coronavirus drugs become available, vaccines will remain crucial, all scientists Sixth Tone spoke with agree. Cures can’t stop the virus from spreading. “Drugs act more like a fire extinguisher which is to help when vaccines fail to provide enough protection,” says Wang, of the University of Arizona. “When you don’t vaccinate enough people, there’ll be more people who become infected and need to take these drugs. That’d actually accelerate the speed at which the virus mutates and becomes resistant to the drug.” An open and perhaps unanswerable question is whether the potential future availability of COVID-19 cures might make the Chinese government reconsider its “zero-tolerance” policy toward COVID-19, wherein it launches stringent control measures over even a single case and keeps the county’s borders mostly closed. As of Nov. 29, nearly 80% of the Chinese population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and cities across the country have launched booster programs. But the sly virus continues to break through the defense, causing sporadic flare-ups across the country. Chinese companies are developing vaccines with the same mRNA technology that made the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines highly effective. But, despite the CEOs’ ambitions and matching levels of confidence, large-scale trial data have yet to be released, a sign that getting home-made mRNA vaccines into Chinese people’s arms may still take time. All in all, it has become clear that with the emergence of highly transmissible virus variants and waning vaccine immunity over time, herd immunity, a scenario where enough people become immune to the disease either via vaccination or infection, may be unachievable. COVID-19 cures could make loosening restrictions more palatable. Tsinghua’s Zhang says the drugs will “provide confidence for gradually opening up.” “You could still get sick even if you’re vaccinated,” Zhang Wenhong, a prominent infectious disease doctor, said during a conference in Shanghai in October. “Drugs free us from the fear of dying from the disease.” He then quoted ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu: “To be victorious over the coronavirus, we shouldn’t hope that it never comes, but hope that we’ll have enough weapons when it does.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009132
Virus Surge in Border Areas Drive China’s COVID-19 Outbreak,A city in Inner Mongolia has logged dozens of locally transmitted cases over the past few days.,2021-12-03,"China’s COVID-19 cases have surged for the fifth consecutive day, as infections in border areas in the north accelerate, prompting the suspension of imports and increasing concerns of additional transmission. Manzhouli, a city bordering Russia in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has become the latest virus hotspot in the Chinese mainland, with 56 of the 80 locally confirmed cases reported Thursday. The city of around 150,000 people has confirmed over 200 local infections in just a week, leading to massive testing, school closures, community lockdowns, and strict restrictions on inbound and outbound travels. The outbreak has been traced to viruses carried by imported cargo, local authorities said. The first local infections — all initially asymptomatic, though two later became confirmed cases after showing symptoms — were detected among people working in an international freight yard dealing with timber. Authorities have since closed the port entry in Manzhouli and suspended flights and public transportation amid concerns of more transmission. Over 65% of overland freight between China and Russia passes through Manzhouli, raising fears of supply chain disruptions in the wood industry, considering the city’s significance in the trade. Since the first COVID-19 cases were reported, the pandemic has now dragged on for two years, killing more than 5 million people globally. While China effectively controlled the spread of the coronavirus in April 2020, it has reported smaller but frequent outbreaks and has vowed to stick to its “zero COVID” strategy. China is now on high alert amid the new Omicron coronavirus variant that has now been detected in some two dozen countries, though no such cases have yet been found in the mainland. Zhao Weidong, a senior official of the Beijing 2022 Winter Games, said Friday that the organizing committee is currently evaluating the variant’s impacts on the Winter Olympics to be held in February. Just months earlier, the International Olympic Committee had announced that the Games would be held under strict coronavirus-related rules and only allow domestic audiences. As of Friday, cases linked with the outbreak in Manzhouli were also reported in the northeastern Heilongjiang province, which shares borders with Inner Mongolia and Russia. Authorities in its provincial capital, Harbin, which has endured repeated outbreaks and lockdowns over the past months, is scrambling to contain the new flare-up and offering a 10,000 yuan ($1,570) reward to anyone who voluntarily takes the nucleic acid test and is confirmed positive for the virus. A Harbin resident, surnamed Xiu, told Sixth Tone that repeated outbreaks had dealt a blow to local livelihoods, and his income from the local clinic where he works has steeply declined amid the pandemic. He said his neighborhood is currently cordoned off with yellow metal fences — Xiu said he has increasingly grown accustomed to such lockdowns — after officials tracked a close contact of an individual who tested positive in the area. “I can’t stop laughing when I see the notice,” said Xiu, referring to information on community lockdowns. “Speechless? Helpless? You just know what is about to come.” China’s top health officials have said that the country will stick with strict COVID-19 protocols to prevent outbreaks. A recent study by mathematicians from Peking University — and published on the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention — estimated that China would have more than 637,000 daily new cases if it adopted laxer strategies like those found in the United States.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009122
Shaanxi Institutes Quarantine for Domestic Travelers From Risk Areas,"As China’s latest wave of COVID-19 was receding, the country has witnessed a jump in infections.",2021-11-30,"Just as countries around the world begin to guard themselves against the highly mutated Omicron variant of the coronavirus, some Chinese provinces and cities have implemented strict defenses amid domestic outbreaks that have lasted for more than a month. The northwestern province of Shaanxi has imposed some of the strictest entry control measures for domestic travelers, mandating at least 14-day quarantine — similar to international arrivals in China — for anyone coming from locations designated “medium- and high-risk” in the country, the provincial government said last week. Authorities said the policy would be kept in place from “this winter to next spring” for visitors or returning residents from areas with at least one confirmed or asymptomatic infection. Shaanxi’s strategy indicates the tough stance some local governments are taking, even going a step further than national virus control measures. The province — home to several historic sites and tourist attractions — has classified any area with a single asymptomatic or confirmed case as a medium- and high-risk zone, while the central government requires 10 or more local infections within 14 days for a location to be designated as high risk. On Monday, China reported 21 confirmed local infections, all in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to the National Health Commission. The country currently has 20 medium- and high-risk areas, including 11 in Inner Mongolia, four in the northeastern province of Liaoning, two in Yunnan province in the southwest, and three in Shanghai. Soon after the city of Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia identified three asymptomatic cases on Saturday, it immediately suspended flights and public transportation and carried out mass virus testing among residents. The autonomous region has logged one of the largest number of cases since the fresh wave of COVID-19, first detected in Shaanxi on Oct. 17. A staff at the hotline for Shaanxi’s health commission told Sixth Tone that apart from quarantine measures for domestic travelers from neighborhoods designated as risk zones, others traveling from those districts will have their green health code changed to yellow, rendering them unable to use public transportation or enter public facilities and entertainment venues. Zhang Xiaofei, a photographer based in the city of Shijiazhuang in the northern Hebei province, went to Xi’an in Shaanxi for a photoshoot on Nov. 22 but was told at the train station to either return to his point of origin or opt for a 14-day quarantine. Zhang usually works in downtown Shijiazhuang, more than 60 kilometers away from the local infection areas, which had been downgraded as “low risk” since Nov. 18. “A 14-day quarantine is so troublesome,” he told Sixth Tone, adding that he returned to Shijiazhuang after taking a nucleic acid test at Xi’an train station. He said he wasted 800 yuan ($125) on the two train rides. The entry and exit policies in Shaanxi are part of the initiatives taken to uphold the country’s “dynamic zero” COVID-19 policy, under which local officials have often been punished for lax attitude amid virus flare-ups. While the country’s top officials have indicated that China will stick with the current strategy, some health experts believe they “wouldn’t expect” zero outbreaks. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a conference Sunday that the “containment and zero COVID” strategy was the most effective way to prevent and control infections. A study by mathematicians from Peking University, published on the center’s website, showed that China could record over 637,000 daily infections if the country adopted the United States-like strategy. “(China’s policy) can keep the vast majority of the country unaffected by outbreaks, and to a maximum extent, ensure normal socio-economic situation and life,” Wu said. “We should stick to it, at least during this winter and next spring.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009086
New COVID-19 Cases in Shanghai Prolong China’s Virus Surge,"Coronavirus flare-ups could become routine in the fall and winter seasons, health experts warned.",2021-11-26,"Just as China’s COVID-19 outbreak from mid-October was trailing off, new infections in Shanghai have delayed the goal of achieving zero cases — at least for now. Health authorities in the country’s financial hub announced Thursday that the city had logged three local infections, the first since late August, leading to mass testing of people deemed close contacts and shutting of multiple hospitals. As of Friday afternoon, nine of Shanghai’s top hospitals — including Ruijin and Zhongshan — had suspended outpatient and emergency services for virus tracing purposes. Meanwhile, the neighboring city of Suzhou in Jiangsu province is on high alert after officials in Shanghai revealed that the trio had traveled to the water town before testing positive. Several scenic spots in Suzhou — including museums and its famous Zijin Nunnery — where the three tourists visited have now closed, while Shanghai paused interprovincial tourism groups to and from the city. “(Infections) in the fall and winter will probably be a normal scene, and we may encounter it again in the future,” Zhang Wenhong, a renowned infectious diseases doctor and the leading force behind Shanghai’s COVID-19 response, said at a press conference Thursday. He added that citizens should take a nucleic acid test “as soon as” they show flu-like symptoms. The three individuals who tested positive in Shanghai were fully vaccinated, authorities said. The three residential complexes where they had stayed have been designated “medium-risk areas” with strict quarantine and virus testing efforts put in place. In nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the cities of Xuzhou and Hangzhou have reported one and two asymptomatic infections, respectively, that were linked to the cases in Shanghai — however, China doesn’t include such cases in its daily COVID-19 tally. Authorities in Xuzhou have barred residents from leaving the city without a negative nucleic acid test, while the health codes of 1,565 locals who had “crossed paths” with the single asymptomatic individual have turned from green to yellow. In Hangzhou, authorities said they’d temporarily barred commuters with yellow codes from taking public transport, urging them to be aware of their health status. Many anxious residents said on social media that they’ve been frantically checking their color codes, which acts like a pass to enter public venues and restaurants. China’s daily infections Friday included four confirmed local COVID-19 cases — three in Shanghai and one in the city of Dalian in the northeastern Liaoning province. While the flare-up that started last month has largely been contained, some experts say they “wouldn’t expect” zero outbreaks, a strategy which the government has firmly upheld. The country has largely been able to achieve this goal through mass testing, snap lockdowns, and a widespread vaccination drive that has now covered over 76% of its 1.4 billion people.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009071
China Has Largely Contained COVID-19 in a Month. What’s Next?,"While government officials look at a “dynamic zero” approach in containing the coronavirus outbreaks, experts say the time could be used to build resilience for opening up.",2021-11-18,"China’s latest COVID-19 outbreaks that started in mid-October have spread to 21 provinces and regions. But in just 30 days, confirmed cases have declined to single digits, with only six cases reported in just two provinces Wednesday, compared with two weeks ago when there were 93 infections, a daily high for recent months. The remarkable feat, achieved as several countries reel from surging coronavirus cases, is the result of the country’s “zero COVID” strategy, which includes local lockdowns, mass testing, and strict quarantine measures lasting for at least two weeks to almost a month. China’s strategy has mostly worked, and top health officials have frequently emphasized the country’s determination to achieve a “dynamic zero” target. But at the local level, the restrictions have taken a toll on people’s daily lives and livelihoods. When the city of Lanzhou in the northwestern Gansu province announced a lockdown to contain the virus last month, patients with kidney failure struggled to receive regular dialysis at hospitals and had to rely on volunteers for transport. Some control measures have gone even further, with quarantine staff in the eastern Jiangxi province killing the pet dog of an individual suspected of being infected with the virus, though officials said the personnel acted without “sufficient communication.” A health care expert in the northwestern Shaanxi province told Sixth Tone that he viewed some local virus-containment measures as “chaotic” and requiring “scientific evaluation.” The performance-based assessment mechanism that stresses zero COVID risks has exacerbated the issue, with some dozen officials suspended or admonished for their inadequate response in containing local flare-ups since October. “The decision-makers then get tough — they won’t get dismissed because they failed on the economy, but they could get dismissed for this,” said the former official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Then when they evaluate making decisions, the officials will make decisions that are most beneficial to them.”  Since the first infections were reported in Shaanxi’s provincial capital Xi’an on Oct. 17, the country has logged over 1,300 local cases in a month’s time, according to data from the Nation Health Commission. It’s one of the largest number of cases — three separate clusters were reported in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning — since the initial outbreak in the central city of Wuhan was contained in April 2020, and the start of officials looking toward a “zero COVID” approach.  Chen Xi, associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health, told Sixth Tone that the country’s current strategy was a reasonable choice in the short term. When infection risks are higher, outbreaks in remote villages could pose challenges to the ill-equipped and poorly-resourced communities in such areas, which has long been a weak spot in China’s health care system. But as the pandemic drags on and sporadic flare-ups emerge time and again, residents said they are sometimes frustrated and at times simply unbothered by the local virus-control measures. Lily Guan lives in the northeastern port city of Dalian, another recent COVID-19 hotspot with over 275 infections. The first case detected was in a warehouse staff handling frozen food on Nov. 4.  Guan told Sixth Tone that a handful of residents in a community 2 kilometers away from her apartment had also tested positive for the virus, but it hadn’t disrupted her daily life — except for the four nucleic acid tests she’d received. “I don’t really feel that the coronavirus is around me,” she said, adding there were no citywide lockdowns. Though some people may have harbored a relaxed attitude amid comparatively lower caseloads and casualties in China compared with elsewhere — it has logged just four deaths among over 15,000 infections in the past 18 months — health experts advising the government say relaxing the current containment policies would be “more costly” for China given the global mortality rate. Globally, the case fatality rate from COVID-19 currently stands at 2%, significantly lower than pre-vaccination but still much higher than that of seasonal influenza. But according to Chen, the low mortality rate in China remains untested under the country’s stringent containment of any outbreaks. It will be “unreliable” to reflect the real scenario when China relaxes its approach, he said, adding the number could increase when infections surge. “If you relax it all, with such a large population in China, even a small proportion of deaths will be huge,” Chen said. For now, officials and experts say there are no signs that China may relax its strategy — especially when the country is staring at the onset of flu season, the mass movement of people during the Lunar New Year, and the Beijing Winter Olympics in February — and will instead stick to its checklist of preventive measures. This week, Beijing, which has logged over 40 infections so far amid the new outbreak, required all visitors to undergo COVID-19 testing 48 hours before entering the capital. Meanwhile, several other cities have started providing booster shots to their populations. The Chinese mainland had administered over 2.4 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Tuesday, achieving a national vaccination rate of well over 70%. However, experts like Chen worry that antibody levels — linked to the level of protection against pathogens — remain unclear among China’s vaccinated people. The lower efficacies of Chinese vaccines compared with some of those widely used in the West, as well as waning immunity over time is another concern. China needs to seize the “window of opportunity” in collecting such data, as it would allow authorities to determine the country’s COVID-19 resilience when opening up, Chen said.  In recent months, several countries have relaxed restrictions and even reopened their borders to vaccinated travelers, though there has also been a spike in infections and deaths. South Korea, for example, has been hailed for its virus containment policy without introducing harsh restrictions, all the while minimizing casualties. Other nations, like Singapore, that once followed a zero COVID strategy are loosening their policies amid large-scale vaccination rates. With many places now “living with the virus,” and the availability of new medical advancements against COVID-19, China needs to think about its exit strategy and adapt to the changing circumstances, said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. Currently, two American pharmaceutical companies are seeking approvals and authorizations in the U.S. for their oral pills to treat COVID-19 patients, while China is also developing domestically-made drug and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. “At some point in the future, I suppose that the government in China will have to think about moving away from the zero COVID strategy, but I don’t think they would plan anything now,” he told Sixth Tone. “Looking into the coming six or 12 months, I would expect the border measures to continue to minimize the risks of outbreaks, but I wouldn’t expect zero outbreaks.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008996
Chinese Netizens Angry After Quarantine Staff Kills Pet Dog,Experts are calling for a national guideline to handle pets of individuals who test positive for the coronavirus or are suspected of infection.,2021-11-15,"A quarantine staff in the eastern Jiangxi province brutally killing a pet dog owned by an individual undergoing coronavirus-related isolation at a separate facility has been condemned by both officials and the public. Officials at a subdistrict in the city of Shangrao said the on-site staff conducted “non-hazardous treatment” on the corgi without “sufficient communication” with the pet owner, according to a statement Saturday. They said the staff in question had been removed from their post and the pet owner accepted an official apology. On Friday, the staff member assigned with quarantine-related duties had reportedly entered an apartment and killed the corgi using an iron rod. In a now-deleted post that has since gone viral on microblogging site Weibo, the pet owner had confirmed with local epidemic prevention staff that the dog would be unharmed before she was moved to a quarantine hotel. “As a pet owner, this has caused me extreme psychological and physical discomfort and a strong sense of insecurity and fear,” one user commented in a different post with screenshots of the government’s statement.  In September, local authorities in the northeastern city of Harbin were also criticized after they euthanized three cats owned by a COVID-19 patient after the pets also tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, in Shangrao, the dog owner and her family had tested negative for COVID-19, and there was no evidence that the dog was infected, local media reported Saturday. Li Hui, director of the animal protection organization in the city of Yichang, central Hubei province, told Sixth Tone that it is “unacceptable” to forcefully kill pets whose owners were in quarantine at a different location. She said such actions were “cruel and inhumane.” “If pets can be killed simply under the suspicion of COVID-19 infection, should the suspicious human cases also be killed?” Li said, calling for a national policy addressing the quarantine of pets. “The epidemic prevention staff need to change the way they think about pets. The government can outsource the service of pets’ quarantine to qualified foster care and animal protection centers for appropriate treatment.” While there is no national guideline on handling pets of people who test positive for COVID-19 or are suspected of possible infections, cities have introduced local measures. While Shanghai allows residents to take their pets to quarantine hotels, Beijing has set up special quarantine facilities for pets, and Guangzhou has deployed people to feed the left-behind animals at home.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008964
Shanghai Begins COVID-19 Vaccinations for Children,"Teachers said half their class or more got shots on the first day, but some parents said they’re holding back.",2021-11-08,"SHANGHAI – Long lines formed outside the city’s schools and community health centers Saturday as many primary school students received their first shot of COVID-19 vaccines. The city began taking vaccine signups for children aged 6 to 11 on Oct. 28. Cities across the country moved to vaccinate young residents around the end of October, as a new COVID-19 outbreak infected hundreds spread across a dozen provinces. On the campus of Shanghai Minxing Road Primary School in Yangpu District, parents and their children lined up in pairs for vaccination on Saturday afternoon. Teachers across the city contacted by Sixth Tone said at least half of their class had gotten the shot, but some parents said they were holding off because they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.  At the Minxing Road school, staff in disposable blue scrubs checked the children’s medical histories. “If a child has taken medicine in the past few days, we won’t vaccinate them today,” one worker told Sixth Tone. “For safety, we advise parents to take them to the community health service center after their children fully recover.” Eight children at a time received shots in a large classroom. Televisions showed cartoons, and parents tried to calm kids by covering their eyes or patting them on their back as they braced for the shot. Students were held 30 minutes for observation after the shot. There were two cases of minor discomfort for the whole day — one student fainted upon seeing the needle, and another complained about chest tightness following the shot. In the waiting room, a parent surnamed Yuan told Sixth Tone that more than half of her child’s class came for vaccination on Saturday. “It is safer to get vaccinated, given the epidemic rebound in China,” she said. “All the adults in my family have received the shots, and none suffered any side effects.” Several other parents told Sixth Tone that they didn’t have an opinion on the vaccine, and were only “going with the flow.” A mother named Li Qiong said there’s nothing holding people back. “In China, the vaccines are for free. In foreign countries, people have to pay for it, and they don’t necessarily have access to it,” she said. “It’s of course better to get vaccinated as early as possible as you can develop immunity earlier. The vaccines are particularly essential in a big city like Shanghai, where there is a huge migrant population.” In Huangpu District, where students also received their first shots over the weekend, a teacher told Sixth Tone that as many as 85% of all fourth and fifth-graders at her school had been vaccinated. “The percentage is a bit lower in the lower grades. For instance, for the third grade, it’s around 70%,” said the teacher, declining to be named as she’s not authorized to speak to the media. “It’s completely voluntary — the school didn’t pressure any students or their families. Most parents had already received the vaccines and didn’t suffer any adverse effects, so they decided their children should go for it.” The teacher added, however, that she would be more cautious with her 5-year-old daughter, as she personally experienced a low fever and felt very uncomfortable after receiving the second shot of the vaccine. In Pudong New Area, parents told Sixth Tone that many classes saw immediate take-up of no more than half. “Many chose to wait and see, like I did,” said a mother surnamed Yang, who has a child in the fifth grade. “This is essentially an issue about health, and the kids are so young and they’re still growing. I’d rather be cautious. After all, many of those who got infected in the latest rounds of domestic outbreaks had been vaccinated.” Yang said her school didn’t pressure parents to agree to the vaccines. Another parent of a second-grader from a Pudong school told Sixth Tone that she chose to pull her son from the program because her son is allergic to milk and eggs. “Less than half of students at my son’s class went for the shots,” the mother surnamed Zhu told Sixth Tone. “Many just caught a cold in the past week. My son’s allergy has made it impossible for him to receive flu shots. Of course, I’m worried if this relatively newly-developed vaccine will be safe enough for him,” she added. In the suburban district of Baoshan, the mother of a first-grader told Sixth Tone that she found an excuse to get her child out of the vaccine. Concerned about side effects, her family took their 7-year-old daughter for a flu shot last week, knowing that it meant she couldn’t receive any other vaccines within two weeks. “The school didn’t say it’s compulsory, but did ask parents to write down the reason why if they chose not to get their child the vaccine,” she explained. “I couldn’t think of any other appropriate reason.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008905
The Plight of Chinese Workers in Cambodia Waiting to Return Home,Limited flights and exorbitant airfares have left many workers in limbo.,2021-11-05,"Thousands of Chinese workers in Cambodia are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to return amid fewer flights, high ticket prices, and strict quarantine requirements at the host and home countries, multiple people Sixth Tone spoke with said. Four workers from state-owned construction corporations and manufacturing entrepreneurs stationed in the capital Phnom Penh told Sixth Tone that one-way airfares to the southwestern city of Chengdu have skyrocketed to 60,000 yuan ($9,380) for the coming weeks. This excludes additional costs amounting to thousands of yuan associated with the mandatory 14-day pre-quarantine in the departure city and at least another two weeks after arriving in China. “We planned to visit home, but the fare is now above 60,000 yuan in the market,” an entrepreneur surnamed Shi said. “Besides, we need to pay for a quarantine hotel even before boarding.” Shi is among the tens of thousands of Chinese who moved to Cambodia, as China expanded its financial footprint with its multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in the country. Those projects have ferried not just workers at state-owned enterprises but also individual entrepreneurs who landed in the Southeast Asian nation after witnessing growing opportunities. Then COVID-19 hit. But despite the pandemic, multiple Chinese construction companies and workers remained in the country to complete the projects, according to state-run Xinhua News Agency. Shi, who invested in waste treatment plants in Phnom Penh three years ago, said many entrepreneurs left amid the pandemic, though thousands of construction workers employed with state-owned enterprises stayed. Now, either their projects are completed or their contracts up, and they want to return home. Among those urgently seeking tickets are those with China’s BRI projects in Phnom Penh, a Chinese hotel owner, surnamed Chen, in the city told Sixth Tone. He said his hotel currently accommodates around 50 employees of a Chinese state-owned construction company, all desperately waiting to return home. “Many aid projects such as highways and hydropower stations have been completed,” Chen said. “They have no reason to stay.” When approached by Sixth Tone, some employees said their company had asked them not to talk to the media.  In recent weeks, Chinese workers in Cambodia have shared their plight in online forums such as Baidu Tieba, with many complaining about steep air tickets. “I went to the hotel designated by the airline and got quarantined for 14 days, during which I had to undergo three nucleic acid tests and one blood test,” one user said on Baidu Tieba. “The journey back home is long.” Their suffering only exacerbated as Chinese airlines slashed flights due to the “circuit-breaker” policy — shutting down carriers for a limited time if a certain number of passengers test positive for the coronavirus upon arriving — over the summer. Major domestic carriers, including China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and Spring Airlines, have suspended flights to Phnom Penh until November after dozens of passengers tested positive in June and July. With only two Cambodian airlines — Cambodia Airways and Lanmei Airlines — flying weekly to Chengdu and Guangzhou, ticket prices have soared since August. Three people Sixth Tone interviewed said a one-way ticket that cost around 15,000 yuan in May skyrocketed to over 50,000 yuan by August. To avoid triggering China’s circuit breaker, Cambodian air carriers imposed a 14-day pre-departure quarantine at assigned hotels starting June. Chinese workers in Phnom Penh told Sixth Tone that such hotel accommodation costs 447 yuan per day. But the expenses and additional amenities have been so high that the Chinese embassy in Cambodia intervened last week. In a statement, it urged Cambodia’s airlines to stop raising fares amid flight shortages and shorten the required pre-departure quarantine. On Wednesday, Cambodia Airways said it was changing its quarantine policy from 14 days to four days, according to the Chinese embassy’s requirement. However, the fares remain unaffordable for many, as travel agents reportedly bought all the tickets to resell at a higher price, the Chinese hotel owner Chen said. He added tickets from Phnom Penh to Chengdu still cost around 60,000 yuan, while major online travel platforms yield no results for the trip. “Those who couldn’t afford the current market price are waiting for other airlines to resume,” Chen said. But that seems unlikely. Last month, the Chinese aviation regulator reduced scheduled international passenger flights to and from the country — from 644 weekly flights in summer to just 408 throughout the winter season ending March. Only Cambodia Airways is allowed to operate one weekly flight to Chengdu until then. Sporadic COVID outbreaks across the country have posed further challenges for returnees amid strict virus-control measures. As of Friday, China had reported over 700 domestic COVID-19 infections in at least 14 provinces and regions since a fresh wave started in mid-October, according to the National Health Commission. Many in Cambodia waiting for the three-hour flight home said the recent developments have dashed their hopes of returning anytime soon. The wait, they said, has become endless, and the possibility of a family reunion for the Lunar New Year in February dimmer. “I am lucky to have a long-term place to stay and have my business running,” Shi said. “But what about those construction workers who don’t have sustainable income?”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008882
"Ongoing COVID-19 Outbreak Hits Schools in Zhengzhou, Beijing","About a dozen students and teachers in two cities have contracted COVID-19, forcing limited school closures as China battles a new outbreak.",2021-11-05,"As China begins vaccinating children against COVID-19, the central province of Henan is battling a school-centered outbreak. By Thursday evening, the provincial capital Zhengzhou had confirmed 14 positive cases since the first patients were diagnosed on Tuesday – six of them students from the same primary school. All of the infected students are aged 6 or 7. Two students at Xingyang Donglin Shui’an Primary School were among the first three cases confirmed on Tuesday. The first case involved a 7-year-old girl who tested positive along with her father after they visited a local hospital for a fever. Her father, an English tutor, had been paying home visits to students at a few residential compounds in the previous two weeks. Home tutoring has been banned by Chinese authorities since the launch of the “double reduction” policy in late July, aiming to ease students from the burden of school homework and extracurricular training. In practice, however, many continue to operate under the radar. A university student from Zhengzhou, surnamed Zhao, told Sixth Tone that home tutoring services are popular in his home city. “It’s common in Zhengzhou that you find a home tutor through familiar connections. But this incident will definitely make people more cautious,” he said. By Wednesday, over 3,000 teachers, students, and parents associated with the school at the center of the outbreak had received nucleic acid tests, with another four positive results. The results of the second round of tests will come out later on Friday. Sixth Tone’s call to the local disease control office in Zhengzhou went unanswered on the day. Feng Jing, the mother of a fourth-grader in the city at an open school, said she’s following instructions to continue sending her son to school despite her concerns. “Nothing matters more than health,” Feng told Sixth Tone. “The situation makes us worried, but there’s nothing we can do about it – our child must continue going to school.” At the moment, Zhengzhou is also testing more than 20,000 students and teaching staff in six other local schools, citing “close contacts” with the confirmed cases. On Friday morning, the city authority ordered the closure of all tourist destinations and indoor entertainment such as cinemas, KTVs, and bars. The outbreak comes as China begins a national effort to vaccinate children, targeting children aged between 3 and 11, following emergency approval of a vaccine for young children. Zhengzhou began an effort to vaccinate its 1.52 million children Monday. The city’s Disease Control Center said it aims to complete the drive by the end of December. Schools in Beijing have also been affected during the ongoing outbreak. After cases including a primary school teacher and the teacher’s child were confirmed in the capital Monday, two schools in downtown Chaoyang District were shut, with thousands of students kept on campus into the evening for tests. Although no one has tested positive so far, the two facilities, together with 16 related schools in the district, have remained closed.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008891
Shanghai Disneyland Gets a COVID-19 Scare on Halloween,The spooky Halloween ambiance turned a bit too real for many at the theme park over the weekend.,2021-11-01,"People dressed in personal protective equipment at the Shanghai Disney Resort were not in Halloween costume Sunday but conducting coronavirus testing on thousands of visitors and staff before they exited amid a COVID-19 scare. The theme park sounded the alarm after two visitors who reportedly visited the park Saturday were identified as a close contact of an individual who tested positive for the virus. The two were informed on their train ride home to the city of Shangrao in the eastern Jiangxi province and sent to an isolation center at the nearest stop, Hangzhou — one of them later tested positive for COVID-19. On Sunday evening, Shanghai Disney announced it would temporarily suspend operations to “cooperate with the pandemic investigation request in other provinces and cities.” All visitors were required to take a nucleic acid test before leaving the park, as well as a second test after 24 hours. As of 8 a.m. Monday, 33,863 people who were at Disneyland and Disneytown over the weekend had tested negative for the virus, according to the city government. A visitor, surnamed Gu, told Sixth Tone that many people inside the park were calm, and all outdoor activities, including parades and fireworks, continued as scheduled, even after the announcement. Video footage of visitors standing in line to get their COVID test under the fireworks-lit sky has since gone viral on Chinese social media.  “The atmosphere was still festive,” said Gu, adding that the virus testing was well organized. “Most people came here for the Halloween carnival that takes place once a year. We don’t want our joy to be cut short.” The immediate mass virus testing at Shanghai Disney showcases the swift actions — and sometimes extreme measures — authorities undertake to prevent virus spillovers, as the country witnesses a fresh outbreak. On Sunday, China reported 59 local infections, most of them in the country’s north, according to the National Health Commission. Authorities have been on high alert, as at least nine provinces and regions, including Beijing, have reported over 400 cases since the latest outbreak started in mid-October. Officials in the Chinese capital, which witnessed a surge in coronavirus infections over the past two weeks, said no local infections were reported Sunday. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, people lined up in droves outside hospitals past midnight on Sunday after the city mandated compulsory coronavirus testing for all who had visited Disneyland over the weekend. They were also required to immediately notify their residential committees, companies, and schools. Shanghai Disney Resort and Disneytown will be closed Monday and Tuesday “in order to follow the requirement of pandemic prevention and control.” The theme park was last closed for over three months starting January 2020 in the initial days of the pandemic.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008843
A Border City Offers a Peek Into China’s “Zero COVID” Strategy,"To prevent any COVID-19 flare-ups, Ruili in Yunnan province has adopted strict virus control measures, which residents say are taking a toll.",2021-10-29,"A small border city in the southwestern province of Yunnan has experienced multiple local COVID-19 outbreaks since the first infections were reported in March. Now, residents say the prolonged virus control measures put in place since have disrupted daily life and livelihoods. Social media posts from people who identified as Ruili locals have gone viral over the week, with many sharing their plight from the persistent lockdown-like situation. They say the local government’s “extreme measures” to prevent COVID-19 in the community have made it difficult for people to work; they need permits from local governments to leave the city; and students have been subject to just virtual classes for months now. “Persistent lockdowns have disrupted our livelihood,” read one post that has been shared over 500,000 times on microblogging platform Weibo.  Ruili, a city of some 200,000 people that sits on the Myanmar border, offers a snapshot of smaller cities determined to keep the virus at bay in line with the national strategy — while local officials fear punishments for failing to upkeep the virus-free status. Many places have become even more alert with a fresh wave of infections sweeping across China. Ruili residents Sixth Tone spoke to said they feel closed off and isolated. They said most entertainment venues and retail businesses are still closed, resulting in unemployment. “We feel isolated without entertainment,” said a 24-year-old local, surnamed Xu, who works at a state-owned enterprise. “I want to go out, maybe to a big city. My life was plagued with persistent lockdowns and mass testings, which almost drove me crazy.” Sixth Tone’s phone calls to Ruili’s local government to verify the claims made by residents were transferred to the city’s COVID-19 control unit, though phone lines were busy until the time of publication. Since last year, Ruili has reported four sporadic local COVID-19 outbreaks — the city was cleared of the latest local infections in mid-September — resulting in subsequent lockdowns, while authorities continue to report and monitor cases among returnees from Myanmar. On Wednesday, the city government reiterated that it would strengthen its already strict entry-exit rules — unlike other places in China, residents in Ruili are required to undergo pre-departure quarantine and COVID-19 tests before traveling domestically. “I couldn't even go to my grandmother's funeral because local officials denied me a travel permit,” one resident, surnamed Zhao, told Sixth Tone.  Ruili attracts numerous migrants and traders, and its porous border makes it “a hotbed for cross-border transmission of COVID-19,” the city’s mayor said in July. Local authorities were so determined to prevent any virus flare-ups that they introduced a surveillance system equipped with facial recognition technology to track and trace its residents. Such surveillance isn’t unique to Ruili, as Chinese cities continue to conduct mass tracing — and also snap lockdowns — amid coronavirus flare-ups, testing tens of millions of people multiple times within a few days. The approach has mostly worked in China’s favor — though the more contagious Delta variant has added further challenges — with virus outbreaks usually cleared within a few weeks. But as the pandemic prolongs, there are questions as to how long the country plans on extending its zero COVID approach. Once adopted by the likes of New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, those countries have gradually replaced the method with a decision to co-exist with the coronavirus. However, Chinese officials have been cautious about fully reopening borders — travelers into the country are now subjected to strict quarantine measures — with some health experts saying China can’t abolish the restrictions that guarantee normalcy while the rest of the world still grapples with the virus. That same debate exists in Ruili, too, with residents agreeing that testing and quarantine measures were helpful. However, many argue that prolonged curbs on the movement of people could cost the community economically, even when the country’s economic growth is growing, albeit at a slower pace. A local resident, surnamed Dong, said it’s been difficult to keep up with the restrictions. Prior to the pandemic, like many others in Ruili, he said he was engaged in cross-border trade. Now, with his businesses operations halted, he has no job or a steady income like many others in the city, and his savings are quickly depleting. “Some firms are on the edge of collapse,” Dong said. “Apart from restaurants, most industries have shut down.” On Thursday, Ruili’s former vice-mayor, Dai Rongli, penned a poetic and heartfelt letter addressing the issues the city faced. He said the multiple outbreaks have “looted the city,” and its people were “waiting in hope, and feel the endless torture and suffering in the waiting.” The vice-mayor added that the local government was aware of people’s suffering and urged the state to provide financial support to the city. “The key to survival is self-help,” Dai wrote. “It’s imperative to resume production and trade under strict measures … Please pay attention to this beautiful border city. Please give this city a promising future.” That same day, the secretary of Ruili municipal party committee, Mao Xiao, acknowledged the outbreaks have “severely affected” businesses and people’s lives, and the public opinion had “fully exposed” the shortcomings in ensuring their livelihoods,” according to domestic media. Local authorities also pledged millions of yuan in subsidies for people with economic hardships, including those affected by COVID-related restrictions.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008823
China’s ‘Zero COVID’ Strategy Puts Several Cities on Lockdown,"With the Beijing Winter Olympics less than 100 days away, the country is on high alert to halt the coronavirus spread.",2021-10-27,"Several Chinese cities are enforcing strict lockdowns after the country reported its highest daily locally transmitted COVID-19 infections in over a month and authorities scramble to stamp out the virus surge that started mid-October. There were 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 Tuesday, with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region logging more than half of the infections, according to the National Health Commission. The current wave of infections has spread to Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu province in the northwest, the southwestern province of Guizhou, Shandong in the east, as well as the capital Beijing. In Gansu’s provincial capital of Lanzhou, authorities sealed off residential neighborhoods citywide Tuesday, reminiscent of the lockdowns previously imposed in the cities of Wuhan, Urumqi, and most recently, Nanjing. The city’s 4 million residents were asked to stay indoors, while most taxis, bike-sharing services, and public transportation were suspended. “There are no people on the streets now,” a local surnamed Xue told Sixth Tone over the phone, adding residents can apply for entry and exit passes to residential community groups for mobility. Xue, who works at a hotel in the downtown Chengguan District, said the property is not accepting guests and currently only housing officials on virus-prevention duties. Tourists stranded in the city, however, can leave with a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within 48 hours before their trip. Meanwhile, restaurants remained open but mostly to fulfill deliveries, according to another Lanzhou resident, surnamed Li, who works at a fast food chain. She told Sixth Tone that she had done three COVID-19 tests after Lanzhou reported its first infections last week. As of Tuesday, Lanzhou had reported 42 cases of COVID-19 since the latest wave of outbreak started earlier this month. After a tourist couple tested positive for the virus in the northwestern city of Xi’an on Oct. 16, the infections that have been attributed to the more contagious Delta variant have swiftly spread to at least nine regions and provinces, infecting over 170 people. Since China lifted its first and strictest lockdown in the central city of Wuhan last April, the country has largely remained virus-free while other countries have been inundated with infections. Authorities have put greater emphasis on prevention and control of the virus and adopted a “zero COVID” approach — a strategy countries like Australia and Singapore also adopted, but later readjusted — to avert large-scale infections. However, sporadic outbreaks have raised questions over the virus-free strategy. But with the Beijing Winter Olympics less than 100 days away, Chinese authorities are becoming even more cautious, enforcing strict control measures to contain the spread of the contagion. While Beijing is conducting stringent virus tracing of the close contacts of residents who tested positive after returning from trips to northwest China, several other cities are in lockdown mode. Some 1 million residents in the city of Zhangye in Gansu, as well as Erenhot and Ejina Banner in the sparsely populated Inner Mongolia, have barred people from leaving their residential compounds, prohibited inbound and outbound travels except with official clearance, and launched massive virus testing drives to stop its spread. As of Tuesday, Zhangye had logged seven local COVID-19 infections, while Ejina Banner reported 84 cases. Some half a dozen officials, including Ejina Banner’s party chief have either been punished or removed from their posts for their “slack response” against the virus surge. Meanwhile, Ruili, a small city in the southwestern province of Yunnan that borders Myanmar, has faced some of the strictest virus prevention measures amid sporadic outbreaks since last year. In July, the city of 200,000 people also installed a surveillance system with facial recognition to track residents and stop infections. Local residents have taken to social media to complain about mandatory quarantines in sparsely furnished and unhygienic rooms, adding that the persistent lockdowns have disrupted their livelihood. “People in Ruili want more attention and support,” read one Weibo post from a user who identified as a local resident. “You can’t just go straight into lockdown once there are new infections and offer limited explanations.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008806
Chinese Provinces Limit Tourism as COVID-19 Cases Surge in Gansu,Lanzhou residents say life remains normal after the city finds 30 cases in three days.,2021-10-25,"Five Chinese province-level regions are on alert amid a cluster of COVID-19 cases, as the city at the epicenter says it seeks to test all tourists. Over the past three days, five cities in northwestern Gansu province have reported 40 infections, of which 30 were discovered in the provincial capital Lanzhou. Authorities attributed the outbreak to the Delta variant. The Gansu provincial government carried out mass tests after two members of a Shanghai tourist group tested positive for the virus on October 17 in the historic city of Xi’an in neighboring Shaanxi province. On Sunday, local authorities in Lanzhou said that the city would shut down all tourist attractions starting the following day and requested that all tourists stay where they until receiving two negative COVID tests over two days. The suspended national tourism destinations include Dunhuang’s Mogao Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Meanwhile, large-scale gatherings such as banquets are prohibited, to help contain the spread of infections. Despite the recent restrictions, local residents in Lanzhou have reported that their lives mostly continue as usual. “Things have remained normal, with people continuing to frequent restaurants and shopping malls,” a restaurant owner in Lanzhou told Sixth Tone. At least four other regions suspended cross-provincial tour groups the same day, including Beijing, Guizhou, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. As of October 25, two locations — in Beijing’s Changping District and Inner Mongolia — are classified as high-risk areas and 14 as medium risk. People who have been to these areas in the past two weeks may be asked to quarantine or be refused entry into public places when traveling elsewhere. China’s central government announced Sunday plans to provide vaccine booster shots in response to recent outbreaks, and issued specific instructions on who can get them. Wu Liangyou, deputy director of the National Health Commission for Disease Control, told The Paper, Sixth Tone’s sister publication, that anyone who is 18 years or older and who received a Chinese-developed vaccine at least six months ago is eligible for a one-dose booster shot.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008785
China’s New COVID-19 Outbreak Spreads to Multiple Provinces,At least 28 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in seven locations since the first infection was reported Sunday.,2021-10-20,"Just weeks after China stamped out its latest COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern Fujian province, the country is grappling with new infections that now have spread to more than half a dozen locations nationwide. Since a tourist couple tested positive for the virus Sunday in the historic city of Xi’an in the northwestern Shaanxi province, six other provinces and municipalities, including the capital Beijing, have reported at least 28 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in the past three days. The northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reported 10 cases — the largest so far in the current wave — along with the provinces of Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The latest wave of COVID-19 infections was reported just after the country’s weeklong National Day holiday, when hundreds of millions of people traveled across the country. However, no infections linked to the holiday travel have been reported, and the source of infections in Xi’an remains unclear. Xi’an, which is home to major tourist sites such as the terra-cotta warriors, are mandating citywide testing and curbing mass gatherings to contain the spread of infections. Other areas with new infections have also started mass testing, with some locations suspending schools and public transportation. So far, officials haven’t disclosed if the infected patients have been vaccinated against COVID-19. China has so far administered over 2 billion vaccine doses against the coronavirus, with at least 78% of its population fully vaccinated, according to the country’s top health authority.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008747
"After Corona, Can We Get Our Data Back?",The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an arsenal of monitoring and surveillance technologies in China and around the world. But no state of emergency lasts forever.,2021-10-18,"Although it’s become common to think of our world in terms of “Before Corona” and “After Corona,” the vast majority of the planet is still years from leaving the pandemic in the rearview mirror. In the nearly two years since the first cases were identified, the number of recorded infections worldwide has passed 200 million, and over 4 million have died. Even in countries with high vaccination rates like Singapore, a return to “normal” has proven elusive. In China, which has recorded only sporadic outbreaks over the past 18 months and where life has largely resumed, the emergence of just a handful of new cases in a region will typically trigger a host of strict preventative measures, including traffic controls, mass screenings, and lockdowns. Even in areas without active outbreaks, mask-wearing, temperature checks, and health passports remain widespread, and with the Winter Olympics looming early next year, there are few signs that this will change anytime soon. Still, just because there’s no end in sight doesn’t mean it’s not important to plan for what “After Corona” might look like. Over the past two years, countries around the world, including China, have responded to the current public emergency by rolling out vast new surveillance and data collection apparatuses in the name of disease control and prevention. What happens to that information — and the bureaucracies that have sprung up around it — once COVID-19 ceases to be a major threat? COVID-19 isn’t the first time a major outbreak has forced China to reevaluate its regulatory and legal approach to public health and safety. It was the 2003 SARS epidemic that finally pushed lawmakers to establish the legal framework for a more robust and elaborate emergency response system. That April, the central government drafted new regulations outlining state responses to public health emergencies. Less than a month later, the regulations were passed and implemented in one of the fastest legislative processes in modern Chinese history. The next year, lawmakers reworded the section of China’s constitution on martial law, replacing the term with “state of emergency” to give themselves greater latitude in such situations. Over the ensuing decade and a half, China continued to enact and revise legislation in response to a series of crises, including a chemical spill in the Songhua River in 2005 and the devastating Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. These disasters repeatedly forced different levels of government to produce contingency plans which — together with the aforementioned laws and the Ministry of Emergency Management established in 2018 — became the foundation of China’s current emergency response system. The COVID-19 pandemic has likewise ushered in changes and tweaks to this system. In particular, technology and private firms are playing an increasingly significant role in emergency response work. As early as February 2020, the Hangzhou-based tech company Alibaba began working with that city’s government to launch a “health code” system: a kind of digital passport that records and tracks users’ identity card numbers, phone numbers, addresses, travel itineraries, and other information to produce a dynamic, colored code specifying their transmission risk. A green “low risk” assessment grants access to public spaces like train stations, airports, or hospitals, while yellow or red indicate a potential public health risk. Soon, other local governments across China launched their own health code services, often in cooperation with Alibaba or another tech firm, Tencent. Compared to traditional epidemiological survey work, digital tracking systems like health codes have numerous advantages. They collect personal information and update risk assessments in real-time, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of transmission. The swift rollout of the health code system helped China’s businesses to reopen relatively early in the pandemic. Countries like Korea, Singapore, and Israel have all implemented their own digital trackers, each tailored to local needs. Yet the question remains: What happens to all this data — and the invasive methods being used to collect it — after the pandemic? Indeed, despite almost no recorded instances of local transmission in much of the country over the past 18 months, some cities have floated preserving and even expanding the health code system moving forward. For instance, Hangzhou has contemplated using big data assessments to assign “health indicators” to residents, neighborhoods, and companies in the future, while the nearby city of Suzhou tested a “civility code” system monitoring citizens’ traffic violations and volunteer service records. The fact that much of this data is collected in cooperation with some of the country’s biggest tech companies also raises questions.  The bulk of local health code expansion plans went too far for residents and ended up fizzling away in the face of vocal opposition. Yet for all the detailed emergency response legislation enacted in China over the past two decades, the decision to return to normal and suspend the emergency measures that laid the groundwork for them remains at the discretion of officials. This is not a new problem, or even a technology-specific one: Traditional emergency management systems like requiring visitors to sign in before entering residential neighborhoods have also persisted long after the danger of COVID-19 receded. Still, digital tracking systems could prove particularly hard to quit. Governments and companies alike are often reluctant to part with the new powers they gain under a state of emergency, and they may see the personal data and user profiles collected and produced by these systems as a potential asset. Even now, after the central government established its own unified national health code system to alleviate public concerns about the patchwork, ad hoc, and potentially insecure nature of the first, locally developed generation of passports, many regions continue to require residents show their local codes. For those looking to minimize the risk that the privacy violations currently being undertaken in the name of public health outlast the present emergency, there are at least two worthwhile options. The first and most immediate is to set higher privacy standards for the collection, revelation, and use of personal data. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been multiple instances in which an infected person’s information has been leaked or otherwise exposed. Technologies such as anonymous Bluetooth-based contact tracing and other privacy-first tracking tools can help protect citizens’ privacy while still enabling effective disease control and prevention work. The second and more long-term solution is to legally require that all data collected is erased once it is no longer needed after the pandemic. China has actually taken steps in this direction. Borrowing from the European Union GDPR’s “right to be forgotten” mechanism, lawmakers included a clause in this year’s Personal Information Protection Law stating that personal data should be deleted once “its processing purpose has been achieved, can no longer be achieved, or (the data) becomes unnecessary for achieving its processing purpose.” Set to take effect on Nov. 1, this law applies to both public platforms and private internet companies alike. While not explicitly related to the health code system, there’s no reason to carve out an exception for these platforms after the pandemic has passed. Technology has played an important role in China’s efforts to combat the current pandemic. Spurred by public demand, officials have moved to increase the accessibility of online public service platforms and health services. At the same time, however, we should also acknowledge that the current emergency response measures are conditional, and the authority given to officials under the state of emergency doesn’t automatically legitimize them after the state of emergency has passed. If any of the extraordinary measures adopted over the past two years are to be incorporated into everyday governance, it must be done with the informed consent of the people.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008729
Chinese Official Touts Effectiveness of Inhaled COVID-19 Vaccine,China has not yet approved any inhaled vaccine against the coronavirus.,2021-10-13,"SHANGHAI — An experimental inhaled COVID-19 vaccine could provide stronger protection than injectable shots, even with a lower dosage, a provincial health official said during a biopharma conference Tuesday. Zhu Fengcai, the deputy head of the Center for Disease Control in the eastern Jiangsu province, explained how inhaled vaccines work directly at the virus’ point of entry, giving them the advantage of inducing an immune response at the mucosal surfaces of the nose and mouth, where the coronavirus is most likely to invade the body. “It’s like drinking a coke,” Zhu said, speaking at the International Biopharma Industry Week in Shanghai, showing an illustration of a person covering their mouth with a plastic cup. “But instead of a liquid, you take in gas. It’s that easy.”  While discussions on nasal sprays and inhaled vaccines for use against COVID-19 have gained momentum, such methods have yet to take off globally. Though China hasn’t approved the inhaled vaccine, it has green-lighted the injection version of the shot developed by domestic vaccine maker CanSino Biologics — dubbed Ad5-nCOV — for emergency use. Two small-scale human studies of the inhaled vaccine in China have shown promising results, with one study published in the British medical journal, The Lancet. Some 300 adults who took the inhaled vaccine, which had a fifth of the dosage contained in the injection version, induced a similar immune response. However, the effectiveness of CanSino’s inhaled vaccine in preventing COVID-19 remains unclear, as it has yet to be tested in large-scale phase III trials. “Vaccines alone can’t stop the spread of (COVID-19),” Zhu said, referring specifically to the outbreak that started from the city of Nanjing and spread to several places over the summer. “The most important use of the vaccine is to prevent severe disease and death. We still need to wear face masks and practice social distancing.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008692
Harbin Euthanizes 3 Cats After Testing Positive for COVID-19,The cats were likely infected by their owner who was quarantined last week after contracting the virus.,2021-09-29,"Local authorities in northeastern Heilongjiang province euthanized three cats owned by a COVID-19 patient after the pets also tested positive for the virus, The Beijing News reported Tuesday. The cat owner, surnamed Liu, was quarantined at a hospital in Harbin last Tuesday and had asked staff from her residential community to check on the pets, according to the media report. Liu said she received a notification from her residential community Monday, saying all her furry friends tested positive twice for the virus after undergoing anal swabs. “Because there is no precedent for treating pets, they said that my cats would be euthanized, and that I needed to write a consent form, which I didn’t agree to,” Liu said, adding the animals should be given a chance to recover. However, the cats were put to rest Tuesday in line with measures stipulated by the country’s prevention and treatment of infectious diseases law. The guideline states that wild and domestic animals and fowls that have contracted viruses may be culled to prevent the spread of the infection. Earlier this year, Chinese scientists published a paper identifying at least 44 species, including dogs and cats, susceptible to contracting the coronavirus. However, experts state that though animals in close contact with infected persons may contract the virus that causes COVID-19, there is no evidence that says they can transmit it to humans. Nevertheless, a leading disease control expert told The Beijing News that if the cats subsequently tested positive, they should be euthanized to stop possible risks of COVID-19 transmission. Yang Qiqing, director and chief veterinarian of Shanghai Companion Animal Hospital, told Sixth Tone on Wednesday that while “culling” is used for measures taken when infectious diseases involve poultry and livestock, humane euthanasia is widely used for pets, such as dogs and cats. He suggested pets that test positive with no symptoms could be reunited with their owners once they test negative for the virus. “However, since there is no such policy yet, it’s up to the health commission to make a decision based on the pandemic situation,” Yang said. On the microblogging platform Weibo, many users expressed their shock, anger, and grief over the euthanization. “These cats are like the owner’s children. It’s not difficult to quarantine cats, so why not give them the chance for treatment?” asked one user. “I’m sure there’s a better way to do it, but some people just don't want to waste their time on small animals. If more pets are infected later, do they all have to be euthanized?” another user commented. As of Tuesday, Harbin reported 67 new local confirmed cases in a fresh outbreak that started last week, according to local health authorities. City officials described the outbreak as having an “unclear origin, rapid spread, and complicated case trajectory.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008617
"To Fight COVID-19, District Rewards Outing Untested Neighbors","With a fifth round of testing coming up, a district of the Chinese city Xiamen wants people to tattle on hold-outs.",2021-09-24,"A district of the eastern city Xiamen, currently struggling to contain China’s latest COVID-19 flare-up, has promised to pay people for reporting anyone who has yet to get tested for the coronavirus this month. People whose tip-offs could be verified will receive 1,000 yuan ($155), Tong’an District said in an announcement Friday, a day after ordering the fifth round of district-wide testing in just 10 days. Since Sept. 10, when the first case of the current outbreak was discovered in Fujian province, where Xiamen is located, there have been 453 local COVID-19 cases. The outbreak, attributed to the delta variant, is mostly dying down, but Tong’an District still registered 10 new cases on Thursday. It is the only area in the city categorized as “high-risk.” Residents have been ordered to stay indoors since the first local case. Some Xiamen residents agreed the severity of the situation means such “tough measures” are appropriate. “Although the nucleic acid tests scheduled by residential communities or companies are convenient enough for people to get tested, I’ve noticed that people still have different mindsets on the measures and that many are still too lazy or unwilling to take the test,” a Xiamen native surnamed Wang told Sixth Tone. The Tong’an District government requires informers to provide the names of themselves and of the person they are reporting on, saying the privacy of both tipper and hold-out would be protected. But that promise might not be strong enough for some residents. A government worker who answered the tip-off hotline told Sixth Tone that there have been two calls since the announcement was made, but that in neither case the person had been willing to provide the name of the person they wanted to report. “Such information didn’t exactly help our screening process,” said the worker, who wished to remain anonymous. “Residents might mostly want to report on people who are close to them, so they’re afraid to reveal their real names.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008584
Chinese Schools Discourage Holiday Travel Amid COVID-19 Surge,"While some students must get school approval, others need to undergo 14-day home isolation before returning to class.",2021-09-23,"Schools in several cities are tightening measures to control the spread of COVID-19, with some canceling in-person classes and others prohibiting holiday travels amid local outbreaks that have affected many children. In the northeastern city of Harbin in Heilongjiang province, all kindergartens, primary, and middle schools suspended classes for a week starting Wednesday amid a surge in local infections. At least 11 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the first case was reported Tuesday, according to local authorities. Schools across the country have been on guard following the recent outbreak in the eastern Fujian province, where dozens of children had contracted the virus. Two students in the city of Putian tested positive for the virus on Sept. 10 in the fresh wave of infections that is said to have links with a local student’s father who may have been infected during quarantine. As of Wednesday, Fujian had reported around 440 positive cases, according to local health authorities. As many as 92 were children under the age of 14 have been hospitalized, with the youngest being less than 4 years old. To prevent any possible virus flare-ups during or after the upcoming seven-day National Day holiday, several schools have asked parents and students to refrain from long-distance travel lest they want to be subject to quarantine upon their return. Education authorities have routinely discouraged school staff and students from leaving their cities for holidays during local outbreaks. One parent from Shanghai said their child’s school had demanded that students who travel during the holidays must complete 14-day home isolation before they return to school. “It’s literally banning travel outside the city during the holiday,” said the parent, who declined to be named. “It’s a bit extreme because that means my family’s travel plans will again fall flat along with our summer vacation, which was ruined by the domestic outbreak triggered in Nanjing.” Another school in Shanghai requires students to provide a negative COVID-19 test report within 48 hours of returning to school after their travels, according to another parent. Students must also first get travel approval from their class teacher before leaving the city. In the eastern city of Nantong in Jiangsu province — which recently contained its COVID-19 outbreak — some schools have asked students and teachers not to travel during the holiday, according to one teacher. “The school is trying to reduce the risk to zero,” said the teacher surnamed Yu. “But many students’ parents still frequently travel for business. I wonder whether the tight control over teachers’ and students’ travel alone is secure enough.” Meanwhile, in Beijing, some parents said the majority of schools have only asked students not to travel to areas designated as medium- or high-risk. However, parents are required to inform schools of their travel plans before leaving the city. Earlier this month, following the outbreak in Fujian, the country’s top education authority had encouraged all teachers and students to stay put for the holidays, including during the just-concluded Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday that starts Oct. 1.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008569
COVID-19 Outbreak Puts Shoe Industry Town on Unsteady Footing,"Due to lockdowns, Putian’s many footwear factories are running out of materials.",2021-09-21,"In Putian, a city in eastern China’s Fujian province that is among the hardest hit in the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, companies in the shoe industry, a pillar of the local economy, say they are close to suspending operations. Since Sept. 10, when the current outbreak began, more than 190 people in Putian have tested positive for COVID-19. Besides at schools, many infections took place in footwear factories. At one local company, dozens of employees tested positive. Putian has some 4,200 shoe companies which together employ over half a million people. They produce 1.26 billion pairs of shoes yearly, almost 10% of China’s total footwear output. But with strict lockdowns in place, these companies are finding it hard to continue operations. An employee of footwear company CRMTO, which produces foam parts used by major international footwear brands such as Nike, Adidas, and New Balance, told Sixth Tone that the company is running out of supplies. “Due to the travel restriction many materials can’t be shipped to our factory anymore,” said the employee, who requested anonymity because she wasn’t authorized to speak with the media. Zhang, the administrative director at Putian Aidu Footwear, a company that specializes in outdoor shoes, told Sixth Tone that although the company still has materials in stock, it only has enough to finish its current orders. To get its outbreak under control, Putian has tested all of its 3.2 million residents, suspended indoor activities, and moved school classes online. Over 1 billion people in China are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, health authorities said on Thursday. But the highly contagious delta variant has nevertheless caused several outbreaks. In Quanzhou, another Fujian city, 11 people who recently tested positive had completed their vaccination regimes. Last week, two Chinese provinces announced they would start giving people in certain high-risk groups booster shots to improve their immunity.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008551
Chinese Provinces Seek COVID-19 Booster Shots Amid New Outbreaks,"While the central government hasn’t officially announced plans to administer additional vaccine doses, Zhejiang and Henan will provide them to “key groups.”",2021-09-18,"At least two Chinese provinces have announced they will administer booster shots against COVID-19 to specific target groups, amid growing calls worldwide for further protection against the coronavirus in the form of an additional dose. On Friday, health authorities in the eastern province of Zhejiang said they would start giving booster shots to fully vaccinated adults between the ages of 18 and 59 in “key groups.” Those eligible for the extra shot include health care workers and customs officials. Xia Shichang, the deputy head of Zhejiang health commission, said the move was part of a national plan set to begin late September to offer an additional COVID-19 shot to fully vaccinated individuals. However, China’s central government has yet to announce a plan on providing additional vaccine doses to its population. Zhejiang’s announcement came just a day after authorities in the central Henan province became the first to announce a booster shot program, though details were scant. Both provinces haven’t disclosed which of the seven COVID-19 vaccines — fully approved or for emergency use in China— would be used for the booster shot. In recent weeks, several high-income countries — including Israel, Germany, the Czech Republic, and the United States — have either kicked off or announced plans to start booster shot programs, despite the World Health Organization’s call to halt them over growing vaccine inequity. As of Wednesday, China had fully vaccinated over 1 billion people, more than 70% of the country’s population, according to Lei Zhenglong, a senior official with China’s National Health Commission. While the coverage is among the world’s highest, the highly contagious delta variant has repeatedly broken through the country’s defenses against the virus. Just weeks after China contained one of its largest outbreaks that started in the eastern city of Nanjing, the country is facing another COVID-19 surge in the coastal Fujian province. The province has reported more than 200 infections since the first cases were identified among two school children last Friday. While the source of the outbreak remains unclear, experts said a returnee from Singapore may have contracted the virus during his quarantine. The man is said to be the father of one of the infected students. The Fujian provincial government hasn’t released the vaccination status of the infected patients, though authorities in the city of Quanzhou said 11 of the 18 infected patients discovered there were fully vaccinated. Most of the initial cases found among airport workers in Nanjing were also fully vaccinated, according to a top doctor at a city hospital. Experts say that breakthrough infections — when a fully vaccinated person becomes infected — are expected, as no coronavirus vaccine is 100% effective in combating the disease. In particular, the Chinese vaccines are about 50% to 78% effective against COVID-19, relatively lower than the efficacy of several Western vaccines. “The move (to provide booster shots) is likely because the disease season is around the corner,” Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist at Wuhan University, told Sixth Tone, adding that winter is peak time for respiratory pathogens, including the coronavirus, to spread. “But whether a booster shot can actually offer more protection — and if so, how you do it — are scientific questions that need data to answer,” he said. According to a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper published in July, Chinese researchers found a notable drop in people’s antibody levels six months after becoming fully vaccinated with the vaccine developed by Beijing-based Sinovac — one of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines in China. The level of antibodies in the blood is generally linked to the level of protection against pathogens. The study also showed a third shot six months after the designated two-dose regimen could increase antibody levels by at least threefold. Nevertheless, the current Chinese-developed vaccines — including one from Sinovac — can significantly reduce the disease’s severity even in case of breakthrough infections, an international panel of scientists concluded in a recently published paper. The panel, therefore, didn’t recommend booster shots for the general population for now, suggesting instead to give vaccine supplies to unvaccinated populations in other parts of the world.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008538
"With Fresh Cases in Fujian, China Faces Another COVID-19 Outbreak",Dozens of people in multiple cities in the eastern province have tested positive for the coronavirus just weeks before the country’s holiday season.,2021-09-13,"Just weeks after China contained one of its worst COVID-19 outbreaks since last year, the country is once again on high alert, with dozens of local infections reported in eastern Fujian province. Over the past three days, the city of Putian had logged 64 COVID-19 cases — half of which were confirmed cases — as of Sunday, according to the city’s health authorities. The nearby city of Quanzhou — recently enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site — reported six confirmed infections, while two people tested positive for the virus in the popular tourist town of Xiamen. ​​The infections in Fujian were first identified in Fengting Town, an hour’s drive from Putian’s city center, after two students tested positive for the virus during a routine testing Friday, according to local authorities. However, officials said the infections could be traced back to one of the student’s fathers who had returned from Singapore on August 4 and tested negative for the coronavirus during quarantine. On Sunday, authorities in Putian said they were carrying out mass testing among the city’s 3.2 million residents. The city has suspended all indoor entertainment and recreational activities and closed cultural sites, while schools have been ordered to conduct online classes and vaccinate all students and teachers before Wednesday. Putian has also implemented strict highway control measures, with residents only allowed to leave after showing a negative coronavirus test result, according to authorities. The infections in Fujian arrive just weeks after the country controlled one of the largest COVID-19 surges since last year. The outbreak that started from the eastern city of Nanjing in July spread to nearly 30 cities, infecting more than 200 people. Putian authorities said cases in Fujian have been attributed to the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Meanwhile, in Xiamen, local authorities have asked residents in Tong’an and Siming districts, where the two positive cases were found, not to leave their residences unless in the case of an emergency. The fresh outbreaks in Fujian also come when millions of people are planning to travel over the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday next week and the weeklong National Day holiday in October. Davina Zhou, a Xiamen native working in Shanghai, said she is worried that the virus surge may thwart her plans of going home next month. Xiamen is about an hour’s train ride from Putian. “There are no travel restrictions now, but no one knows what changes may happen before the holiday,” she told Sixth Tone.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008490
Follow-Up Study in Wuhan Shows Lingering COVID-19 Health Effects,Researchers find some 50% of recovered patients experience at least one persistent symptom a year on.,2021-08-27,"Nearly half of COVID-19 patients discharged from one of the major hospitals in Wuhan, the provincial capital of China’s central Hubei province — where the coronavirus was first reported — experience persistent symptoms one year after recovery, according to data from the largest follow-up study of its kind. More than 800 of the 1,300 recovered COVID-19 patients treated at Wuhan’s Jinyintan Hospital experienced at least one persistent symptom, such as fatigue, difficulties sleeping, or loss of hair, smell, or taste, the study published Thursday in British scientific journal The Lancet said. The proportion, while significant, is lower than the 68% of patients who had reported similar conditions six months after testing negative for the virus. While millions of COVID-19 patients globally recover without developing any health issues, an unknown number continue to exhibit related symptoms weeks or months after they are declared virus-free, a condition now referred to as long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. However, the proportion of so-called long-haulers in Wuhan was much higher compared with some earlier international studies, which estimated around 10% to 30% of COVID-19 survivors suffer from persistent symptoms. Some 20% of recovered patients in The Lancet study said they still experienced fatigue or muscle weakness one year after testing negative for COVID-19. Those ailments were reported as the most common lingering symptoms. The study’s researchers noted that patients who were critically ill from COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from persistent symptoms and prolonged lung damage. Over a quarter of the patients studied also suffered from anxiety or depression a year after leaving the hospital, which “could be driven by a direct effect of virus infection,” the study said. “Additionally, indirect effects including reduced social contact, loneliness, incomplete recovery of physical health, and loss of employment could affect psychiatric symptoms,” according to Thursday’s study. Scientists are still unclear why some patients recover fully from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, while others suffer various ongoing health conditions. However, similar long-term effects have also been observed in patients who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and West Nile fever. An immunologist, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media, told Sixth Tone that some symptoms, such as fatigue and loss of smell could be due to neurological injuries resulting from low oxygen levels in the brain while the patients were sick. “We also can’t rule out the possibility that psychological conditions might play a role in causing these symptoms,” he said. “The study highlights the need to pay attention to patients’ mental health even after they’ve recovered.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008376
"To Get Shots in Arms, Officials Compete For Unvaccinated","Seemingly to boost vaccination rates, all kinds of questionable schemes are being cooked up across China.",2021-08-27,"As China strives to increase the COVD-19 vaccination rate among its population, a tug of war is playing out between different governmental departments, with unvaccinated people being lured from neighboring areas ostensibly to boost local inoculation figures. Authorities in Xinshao County, in the central Hunan province, issued a notice on Sunday that said they would “strictly punish” anyone involved in organizing and transporting local residents out of the county to get vaccinated elsewhere. People reporting such schemes would be rewarded, it said. It might be a case of “it takes one to know one.” A Xinshao elementary school teacher surnamed Xiao told Sixth Tone that she recently received an order from the local education bureau saying each teacher should arrange for at least one person from outside the county to get vaccinated in Xinshao. “If you fail, your merit evaluation will be canceled,” Xiao quoted the order as saying. District governments in Handan, in the northern Hebei province, have also called on people to stop taking local residents to get vaccinated elsewhere. Police in Handan’s Qiu County punished a man for recruiting people on social media to get COVID-19 shots in neighboring towns. On social site Weibo, posts by people from a variety of areas claim to offer pick-up services and cash rewards for any unvaccinated people willing to get their shots. China pursues a zero-case strategy, keeping borders largely shut and adopting aggressive outbreak control measures in the hope that a high enough vaccination rate will allow the country to open up safely. No local vaccination quotas have publicly been announced, but officials’ decision-making suggests they are under pressure to have as many people as possible vaccinated against COVID-19. It has led to another intra-governmental struggle about how much coercion can be applied to convince people to get shots. In July, the country’s highest health authorities reiterated that vaccination is voluntary after local governments across the country had announced that unvaccinated people would lose access to facilities such as hospitals, malls, and public transport. Nevertheless, such initiatives keep popping up. Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper reported Wednesday that low-level officials in the northwestern Qinghai province had warned that families with an unvaccinated member would have their welfare payments suspended. A worker at the residential community in question told The Paper that services wouldn’t really be suspended and that the warning was only meant to scare people into getting vaccinated. During a press conference on Friday, a senior official from the central education department once more criticized schools that continue to insist students can only return for their upcoming fall classes if they, as well as their immediate family members, have received COVID-19 vaccines. As of Thursday, China had administered more than 2 billion shots of mostly two-dose COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008373
"While COVID-19 Kept People at Home, China’s Plants Grew Greener","Plant life thrived amid the pandemic’s cleaner air, researchers find.",2021-08-26,"Animals around the world seem to enjoy themselves when people are locked down due to COVID-19. Like the mountain lion found strolling through downtown San Francisco last year, they are suddenly free to roam without being disturbed by human activity. Now, new research has shown that plants also thrived during the unique period of the early COVID-19 outbreak, which scientists have called the “anthropause.” In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers found China’s plants were much greener much earlier in the year than in previous years, mainly due to improved air quality. The team, led by scientists at Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, analyzed the atmospheric levels of nitrogen dioxide — a pollutant linked to burning fossil fuels — and aerosols including dust and smog. They found their concentrations were significantly lower than average during the first four months of 2020, the period when China implemented nationwide lockdowns.  Using satellite images, the researchers also measured the changes in vegetation’s leaf coverage — or greenness — in China. They found that, with fewer pollutants in the air in early 2020 and sunlight better able to penetrate the atmosphere, China was about 18% greener in the spring of 2020 compared to the past five years’ average. The “greenness level” they defined as the start of spring was reached eight days ahead of schedule. “Despite the obvious negative impacts of COVID-19 on human well-being, we traced substantial positive impacts on atmospheric optical clarity that subsequently enhanced vegetation growth,” the authors wrote in the paper. “Reducing human activity not only affects climate change over the long term but may also have a more short-term impact that, with appropriate public education, can help to raise awareness of the positive effects of pollution control.” Richard Houghton, an ecologist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, told Sixth Tone he wasn’t surprised that a decrease in human activity would benefit plants, but that he wasn’t convinced by the paper’s argument that more direct sunlight led to increased photosynthesis. “My understanding is that diffusive radiation, as opposed to direct sunlight, may increase photosynthesis,” he said, referring to sunlight scattered by aerosols and molecules in the air which previous research found more beneficial to plant growth. Houghton also reckons the finding’s implications for climate change are probably limited. By the end of 2020, global carbon dioxide emissions had climbed back to levels higher than seen before the pandemic. “At that rate, any effects of reduced emissions have been very short term,” he said. “We really have no alternative to lowering emissions as fast as we can.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008346
Will mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Be China’s Ticket Out of Isolation?,Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna developed the most effective coronavirus shots. Chinese startups are chasing their title.,2021-08-23,"JIANGSU, East China — When the first speaker finally finished clambering over conference attendees on his way to the microphone, he apologized for his lateness. Going by the number of seats, the organizers had expected just a few dozen attendees willing to spend their day pondering RNA therapeutics — a long overlooked niche in biomedical research that concerns itself with using genetic technology for disease treatments. But the field has attracted an explosion of attention globally after two COVID-19 vaccines that use messenger RNA (mRNA) — genetic material that carries instructions for cells — were designed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech with astonishing speed and exceptional success. And so, during a recent, sweltering summer morning, over a hundred people filled the modest conference room, spilling out into the aisles and anywhere else there was space. The speaker, Ying Bo, is the CEO of China’s hottest biotech startup: Abogen Biosciences. Just two years old, the company is one of at least five Chinese hopefuls in the quest to develop a highly effective home-grown mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Abogen’s shot, dubbed ARCoV, is the furthest along. It uses the same core technology as the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, training a person’s immune system by delivering pieces of mRNA into the body that instruct cells to create proteins that are harmless but similar to those of the COVID-19 virus. And while those Western vaccines remain unavailable in China — for reasons experts can only guess at — all eyes are on Abogen and its competitors. Their success won’t just establish China’s biomedical industry as among the global best, but also has the potential to change the course of the pandemic in China and in the many countries around the world that rely on China for vaccines. The country’s race to develop a coronavirus vaccine is entering its second lap.  A Harder Road to Herd Immunity Already, China’s COVID-19 vaccine development has been a success in many ways. So far, within a year and half of the initial outbreak, at least seven different shots have secured emergency or full approval in the country. Domestically, more than 1.9 billion doses have been administered as of Saturday, and, amid limited global availability of Western-made shots, more than a hundred countries have used Chinese vaccines to inoculate medical workers and other groups. The two most-used Chinese vaccines, made by pharmaceutical firms Sinopharm and Sinovac, have received emergency approval from the World Health Organization. They use the more established technology of training a person’s immune system with inactivated COVID-19 viruses. But the Chinese vaccines, while effective at staving off severe disease and death, have proven less effective at preventing COVID-19 cases outright, compared to the two mRNA shots by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. The latter appear to better stimulate the body’s immune system to create virus-defeating antibodies, Shi Jinjun, an RNA therapy researcher at Harvard Medical School affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital, tells Sixth Tone. The Western shots have both shown over 90% efficacy in clinical trials and real-world use, compared to 50% to 78% for the Chinese vaccines. This is one reason why the Chinese government has kept its border tightly shut ever since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The country initially adopted a strategy of strict zero-case policies combined with an aggressive vaccination drive, in the hope that reaching a high enough level of immunity in the population to extinguish any outbreaks — herd immunity — would in time allow the country to reopen its borders. From the outset, reaching that goal posed a formidable challenge. And the emergence of highly contagious virus variants like Delta that reduce the efficacy of current vaccines might have put it out of reach entirely. The math for herd immunity, in essence a combination of vaccination rate and vaccine efficacy, is getting harder to square. Even if China’s entire population were inoculated with the country’s most effective shot, it might no longer be enough to protect against further outbreaks. Although the Chinese government has assured the public that the domestic vaccines are “still effective” against the Delta variant, “not releasing any actual data to me seems that they may not be really confident about it,” Huang Yanzhong, a China health policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, tells Sixth Tone. Currently, China is on the downslope of its largest outbreak of cases in over a year. Authorities say it began when fully vaccinated airport workers caught COVID-19 from cleaning a plane that had arrived from Russia with an infected passenger. The virus spread to at least 13 provinces in the country and officials reinstated lockdowns for thousands of people. The outbreak has put China on alert, and sparked debate over whether the country should change its approach. Like other countries with high vaccination rates, some argue China should gradually open up while dealing with a small number of cases. “China’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy against COVID-19 will only get more costly as the fight drags on and variants emerge,” Huang says. “It means the policy needs to change, but it doesn’t seem that China has the condition for such adjustment.” A more effective vaccine based on mRNA technology, on the other hand, may allow China to hold the course, inoculating itself out of isolation while maintaining its zero-tolerance approach to new cases. As such, the country’s vaccine race continues, for a stronger shot that can fend off a trickier virus. “We must pay attention to mRNA vaccines,” Gao Fu, the head of Chinese Center of Disease Control and Prevention, said during a vaccine conference earlier this year. “[We] shouldn’t ignore the mRNA vaccine just because several COVID-19 vaccines are now available in our country.”  The Shots Heard Around the World The two Western mRNA vaccines are a true scientific triumph. The first-ever shots to use the technology, they proved far more effective than most vaccines for other viruses, and were developed at an unprecedented pace. “Without the pandemic, we probably wouldn’t have had an mRNA vaccine for another five years,” says Huang Linfeng, an RNA biotechnology researcher at Duke Kunshan University in eastern China. They also quickly became entrepreneurial legends. Moderna was founded just 11 years ago and, before the pandemic, had no approved products. But its COVID-19 vaccine has earned it billions of dollars and has sent its stock soaring. Chinese investors and pharmaceutical companies were quick to take note. So far, at least five companies — mostly startups founded around 2019 — have announced they are working on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. On Thursday, Abogen said it had raised over $700 million in its latest funding round. Two months ago, StemiRNA, another Chinese mRNA firm, received $200 million in new financing. “The entire mRNA field is going through exponential growth right now,” Abogen’s Ying said at the RNA therapeutics conference. “In China, the industry is just about to take off.” Abogen is in pole position. Its vaccine, ARCoV, is slated to soon enter a phase 3 clinical trial, in which thousands of volunteers in China and Mexico will receive the shot to test its efficacy against COVID-19. The company is collaborating with a domestic vaccine maker, Walvax Biotechnology, that has years of experience working with China’s regulators. If the vaccine is approved, the two companies say they will together be able to produce over 150 million doses a year. “The one product, the COVID-19 vaccine alone, has brought more than $69 billion in market growth to the (global mRNA) industry,” Ying said. “The amount of financing in the whole field is now in a rapid growth mode, including from venture capital to public bonds.” But to some, the Chinese startups’ investors are blinded by visions of steep profits without heeding the challenges that lay ahead. “We are now seeing that this field of mRNA drugs is actually a dysfunctional situation,” says Huang Linfeng. “Just because the U.S. has this great technology, everyone here starts to flock to it — mostly chasing after the money. Honestly, without accumulation of technology and know-how from years of experience, not everyone can make a good mRNA vaccine.” While designing an mRNA vaccine is a relatively straightforward process whereby all scientists need is a virus’ genetic sequence, “it doesn’t mean they are easy to make at all,” Harvard Medical School’s Shi says. “Moderna and BioNTech have more than a decade of experience in mRNA drug research and development, so they had many things ready when the pandemic hit.”  Roadblocks For nearly four decades, scientists dreamed about using mRNA to develop drugs and vaccines. The scheme of RNA therapeutics is revolutionary. Unlike traditional drugs that are synthesized in a factory, RNA drugs essentially move the factory inside the human body by instructing cells to create the necessary proteins. But for a long time, scientists failed to turn this tantalizing theory into a working product. One roadblock — previously considered insurmountable by some — was that mRNA is fragile. Without a protective shell, the molecule would disintegrate before reaching its destination. It wasn’t until several years ago that researchers successfully designed a wrap of tiny fat bubbles, called lipid nanoparticles, that functions as a safe shuttle for the mRNA molecules. A potential barrier for Chinese and other drug makers hoping to develop mRNA vaccines is that most technological breakthroughs related to RNA medicine are protected by patents owned by companies or researchers in rich, Western countries. Many argue that these patents prevent lower-income countries that may not be able to afford the existing mRNA vaccines from developing their own. In late 2020, India and South Africa proposed to the World Trade Organization that intellectual property (IP) protections on COVID-19 vaccines and other related technologies be waived so that developing countries could also manufacture the life-saving shots. Many wealthy countries, including the U.K. and Canada, voiced their opposition, arguing that manufacturers without experience in this field would produce substandard vaccines while competing with established firms for raw materials. But, this May, the U.S. government said they backed the proposal and pledged to participate in the WTO negotiations. The Chinese government expressed its endorsement as well. “China supports the WTO’s proposal on IP exemptions for anti-epidemic materials such as the COVID vaccine to enter the text consultation stage,” Reuters quoted China’s Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng as saying during a press conference in May. But it’s unclear which patents are under discussion, Gu Xiaoman, a medical IP lawyer at GEN Law Firm in Beijing, tells Sixth Tone. “The move by the Biden Administration is more of a political act, and its practical implications may not be as significant as the gesture,” she says. The term “waiving” is also vague, Gu adds. “It doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll publish their recipe. It could end up being something like ‘we are not going to sue you for using our recipe if you can find out what it is yourself.’” Until the October WTO negotiations take place, it’s unclear if Chinese companies could benefit from the IP exemption. They haven’t commented on the issue. The most disputed patents concern the lipid nanoparticles (LNP) that protect mRNA molecules. Abogen, for one, claims to have created its own LNP technology. During the conference, Ying said semi-jokingly that, “LNP patents aren’t the barrier to enter the industry. Knowing how to get around this patent is the true barrier. If you want to know how to do it, come talk to us, or find a better patent lawyer.” China also has another route to an mRNA vaccine. Shanghai-based Fosun Pharma struck a deal with BioNTech early last year to sell its mRNA shots in mainland China and Hong Kong once local regulators gave their approval. In May, Fosun also announced that the two firms would form a joint venture to manufacture the mRNA vaccine in China. While their shot was approved for emergency use in Hong Kong in January, mainland regulators have yet to give the nod. “I recently heard rumors that the Chinese regulator will approve the shot this month, but also I’ve been hearing that every month,” says Council on Foreign Relations’ Huang Yanzhong. While it’s unclear why the decision is still pending, several Chinese public health experts have suggested giving people a third shot to boost their immunity, and that using a vaccine different from their first two shots would have the biggest impact. “To me, that sounds like a signal for accepting an imported, more effective vaccine,” Huang says. “But it’s not going to be easy to convince the government, as well as the public, to approve a shot made with a new technology.” Some suspect Chinese regulators are moving slowly because they are simply complete strangers to mRNA pharmaceuticals, compared with authorities in the West that have been dealing with experimental products for years. “The Chinese government is very conservative,” says Huang Linfeng, the RNA researcher. He explains that a tiny minority of mRNA vaccine recipients have reported adverse reactions, such as heart inflammation, that scientists don’t yet understand and might give regulators pause. “The technology is just so new,” Huang says.  Rushing Ahead The office of Zhang Jiguo, StemiRNA Therapeutics’ chief financial officer, shows just how fast the industry is moving. He occupies a corner on the second floor of a nondescript building on the outskirts of Shanghai, half of which is empty space with unpainted concrete walls and bare floors. The set-up doesn’t look like it’s part of a company worth billions of yuan. “Not everyone is in here,” Zhang tells Sixth Tone while walking down the building’s narrow hallway. “Our CEO works in the next building, and our research team is upstairs.” Founded in 2016, the mRNA drug-maker only had about 30 people on staff until about a year ago, when it quickly expanded to more than 250 employees. StemiRNA’s vaccine is China’s second mRNA COVID-19 shot to have begun testing in humans. A phase 1 trial just finished, involving fewer than 80 participants at a private hospital in Hangzhou. Zhang also claims that, for people who have already received two doses of an inactivated vaccine, the company’s mRNA vaccine has proven more effective as a booster shot than a third such dose. The results of both trials are yet to be published. The company is looking beyond the typical next step — a phase 2 trial — and is instead hoping to get clinical trials approval for its second generation vaccine. It was designed using the genetic information of the Beta variant, which shares some mutations with its Delta cousin. The hope is that it will prove effective against the most contagious COVID-19 strain to date. “I think it’s the best COVID-19 vaccine in the country, and among the top in the world,” Yao Weiguo, the company’s Senior Vice President, tells Sixth Tone in his office on the equally sparsely adorned third floor. Both he and Zhang received injections of StemiRNA’s experimental second generation vaccine. Yao says he had no noticeable side-effects. Zhang says he experienced only a mild fever after the second shot, and felt fine otherwise. Besides StemiRNA and Abogen, three other Chinese mRNA startups are still testing their COVID-19 vaccines in test tubes or on animals. There is no guarantee of success. CureVac, a German mRNA company with over 20 years of experience in the field, reported in June that clinical trials had shown its mRNA vaccine was just 47% effective in preventing COVID-19, falling short of the 50% efficacy approval threshold set by the WHO and the drug regulators of several countries.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008308
China’s Top Virologist Zhang Wenhong Cleared of Academic Misconduct,Fudan University investigated the doctoral dissertation of the country’s leading COVID-19 expert after accusations of plagiarism surfaced on social media.,2021-08-23,"China’s top virologist Zhang Wenhong, a prominent face in the country’s COVID-19 response, has been cleared of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation weeks after accusations swirled online. Shanghai-based Fudan University said Monday that its academic standards committee found “irregular writing” in the appendix summary of Zhang’s PhD thesis, but that they won’t affect his result and the overall dissertation as they do not constitute academic misconduct. “We confirm that the doctoral thesis of Zhang Wenhong met all the criteria for a qualified doctoral thesis as required in that year,” the committee wrote in a statement. Zhang became a familiar face and a household name in 2020, following his candid advice to combat COVID-19 in the early days of the outbreak. He is often compared with American infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci for his public health explanations and suggestions to stop the pandemic. However, Zhang faced a barrage of criticism online earlier this month after he said China should coexist with the virus, which many believed contradicted the country’s zero-tolerance approach. His comments came amid the recent outbreak that spread from the eastern city of Nanjing last month. Soon after Zhang’s comments, social media was flooded with unverified posts claiming he had plagiarized parts of this thesis from a paper written by a professor from the eastern Shandong province. Last week, Fudan University said that it would investigate the accusations against its former student. Zhang received his doctoral degree in 2000 from Fudan University, where he researched tuberculosis gene mutations. The 52-year-old doctor currently heads the center of infectious diseases at the Fudan University-affiliated Huashan Hospital in Shanghai.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008316
‘Coexist With the Virus’: Chinese Man Detained for COVID-19 Comment,Authorities said the teacher’s remark was “inappropriate” and had caused “adverse social impact.”,2021-08-13,"A teacher in eastern Jiangxi province has been detained for 15 days after commenting on a news article saying the country can “coexist with the coronavirus” amid a new wave of COVID-19 infections in several parts of China, according to local authorities.  The teacher, surnamed Zhang, commented on an article about the outbreak in the city of Yangzhou, which has become the latest coronavirus hotspot in Jiangsu province. The story, which included details on the city’s containment efforts, was published Tuesday on news aggregator platform Toutiao. “How about giving up strict epidemic prevention and experimenting with coexisting with the virus in Yangzhou, a small city without a large population, to provide a reference for the country,” a screenshot of Zhang’s now-deleted comment showed. “Just a suggestion — don’t get mad.” Yangzhou, a city of just over 4.5 million people, has so far reported more cases than Jiangsu’s provincial capital Nanjing, where the latest outbreak started on July 20. Local authorities have strictly curbed the movement of people in the city and have tested millions of people for the virus seven times so far. Local authorities on Wednesday said Zhang had commented on the recent COVID-19 flare-ups “in an inappropriate manner” and caused “adverse social impact,” though they didn’t specify if it had violated any cyberspace-related regulation. The authorities added the teacher deleted his comment upon realizing his “mistake.” Zhang also apologized that same day for his “hurtful” actions, saying that he will abide by laws in the future. Online, some Yangzhou residents slammed Zhang for failing to empathize with people affected by the virus and the restrictions, while others argued that authorities shouldn’t constrain citizens from expressing their opinions freely. Legal experts say Zhang’s comment hadn’t disrupted social order in a way that required police to step in. “The punishment imposed by the local police violates the principle that rules and penalties related to civil rights must be specific with clear and stable meanings and boundaries,” Zhu Xiaoding, a lawyer at Beijing Cailiang Law Firm, told Sixth Tone. While many parts of the world have been grappling with massive surges in COVID-19 cases since last year, China has largely controlled the virus, apart from several sporadic outbreaks. The country’s “zero tolerance” containment approach includes testing entire populations in affected areas, imposing snap restrictions on movement, as well as strict quarantine measures for anyone entering the country from abroad. Some experts have said that countries need to adapt to containment measures and learn to coexist with the virus, which is likely to linger. Last month, top Chinese virologist Zhang Wenhong wrote that the Nanjing outbreak “reminds us of the ever-present virus” and “there will always be risks in the future.” However, many online said the doctor’s idea contradicted with the country’s zero-tolerance strategy.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008252
Yangzhou Becomes Another COVID-19 Hotspot as Cases Surge,The city has tested millions of residents for the coronavirus seven times and imposed strict restrictions to contain its spread.,2021-08-12,"Another city in eastern Jiangsu province has become the latest COVID-19 hotspot in China, as the country tries to contain a new wave of infections that started from Nanjing three weeks ago and has since spread to at least a dozen provinces and regions. Yangzhou has reported 448 confirmed local cases after identification of the first infection on July 28, local health authorities said Wednesday. Officials said the outbreak in the city was “complex and severe,” with infected patients ranging from 1 to 90 years old. The city of just over 4.5 million people now has more infections than the provincial capital of Nanjing, which has logged 234 confirmed cases since the outbreak began from an airport cluster on July 20. Authorities said the latest outbreak started when nine workers contracted the virus while cleaning an inbound flight from Moscow carrying an infected passenger. On Wednesday, Yangzhou also reported 37 of the 61 confirmed local cases in the Chinese mainland, according to authorities. The outbreak in Yangzhou has been traced to a 64-year-old Nanjing resident, surnamed Mao, who had traveled to the city on July 21 without informing relevant authorities. Before testing positive for the virus, she visited multiple public places, including restaurants and crowded mahjong parlors. Her sister, who Mao was staying with, also tested positive for the virus. Mao now faces detention for concealing her travel history, though details about the punishment are unclear. Authorities said one of Yangzhou’s nucleic acid testing sites was also responsible for a new cluster. At least 35 people who received their COVID-19 test in the city’s Guangling District on July 29 tested positive for the virus. Wu Zhenglong, governor of Jiangsu province, said Tuesday there were still weak links and loopholes in controlling the outbreak, urging local authorities to take “more decisive and robust” actions to contain the virus. Yangzhou is mass testing its residents for the virus for the seventh time to find possible infections and break the transmission chain. Residents told Sixth Tone on Thursday that the city has been increasing COVID-19 tests for communities, while curbing gatherings and public activities. A university student surnamed Zhao said she was about to get her seventh COVID-19 test Thursday afternoon, and movement in her residential compound has been limited. “We were tested every two days, but I’m not sure if it will become every day,” she said. “The basic rule is that the test must be done within 20 minutes of queuing. We are also not allowed to gather and chat in the compound, and you hardly see anyone on the road.” Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases in Nanjing have been declining over the past few days. On Wednesday, the city logged only one new case of local transmission, while there were no confirmed infections on Sunday and Tuesday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008236
Nanjing Woman Faces Detention for Hiding Travel History,The woman had flouted virus-control measures by visiting Yangzhou without informing the relevant authorities — and tested positive for the virus days later.,2021-08-04,"Police in the eastern city of Yangzhou said a 64-year-old woman will face detention for not disclosing her travel itinerary, which they said may have contributed to the recent COVID-19 flare-up, domestic media reported Tuesday. The woman, surnamed Mao, had boarded a long-distance bus from Lukou sub-district in neighboring Nanjing a day after the city found nine workers had tested positive at the city’s international airport, according to the media report, citing the police. The woman had left for Yangzhou discreetly without informing relevant authorities after the virus-control measures had been put in place. Six days later, on July 27, Mao visited the hospital in Yangzhou after developing a cough and fever. She tested positive for the virus, along with her sister, who she had been staying with. Yangzhou police said Mao is suspected of violating anti-epidemic and disease prevention regulations, as she didn’t report her itinerary to local community authorities. She also frequently visited several public places, including mahjong parlors and restaurants — trips that have been attributed to a rise in infections. Mao has been transferred to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Nanjing, though details of her detention are unclear. Yangzhou had 126 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday, and the situation remains “severe,” according to local health authorities. The city has reported more daily local infections than Nanjing over the past four days. Meanwhile, a woman in southwestern Sichuan province was detained for 15 days for disrupting COVID-19 control measures, according to media reports. She reportedly slapped a community staff member and threw her mobile phone after the latter asked her to remove her parked bike from the sidewalk to prevent obstructing people’s movement.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008173
Wuhan Finds COVID-19 Cases as Delta Variant Drives China’s Outbreak,"More than two dozen cities in at least 12 provinces and regions have reported infections, two weeks after the first cases were identified in the eastern city of Nanjing.",2021-08-02,"Wuhan, the provincial capital of central Hubei province and where the first COVID-19 cases were identified in China, has reported seven infections since the city was declared virus-free in April 2020. The new infections come as China tries to contain the latest coronavirus surge that has spread to at least 29 cities. As of Sunday, more than 300 people had tested positive for the virus in some 12 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions following a local outbreak that started in the city of Nanjing in eastern Jiangsu province, the state-run Beijing Youth Daily reported. Several cities, including Chengdu and Chongqing in the southwest, the popular tourist town of Zhangjiajie in the central part of the country, Dalian in the northeast, Yinchuan in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as well as the capital Beijing, have reported cases locally. Most of the COVID-19 cases in the latest wave of infections have been reported in Jiangsu, while its spread has been attributed to the highly contagious Delta variant. The outbreak began after workers at Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the virus after cleaning a flight from Moscow carrying an infected passenger, according to authorities.  Nanjing has suspended all outpatient services at the city’s hospitals, operating only emergency medical services, local authorities said Sunday. The city has also suspended all domestic flights and shut sporting and entertainment venues indefinitely to curb the spread of the virus. Yangzhou, a tourist town and home to just over 4.5 million in Jiangsu, has become another COVID-19 hot spot. Many of the city’s 56 infections — including asymptomatic carriers — have been traced to a local mahjong parlor visited by an individual from Nanjing who later tested positive for the virus. Xue Yiyan, a 45-year-old Yangzhou resident, told Sixth Tone that the mahjong parlors are a ubiquitous part of the city and a popular pastime for many elders. He said such places are crammed with hundreds of people at any given time. “Now the pandemic has brought the entire city back to the emergency status like it was in early 2020,” he said, referring to the closure of several public spaces and entertainment venues. New cases have also been reported in the city of Zhengzhou in central Henan province that was ravaged by deadly floods in recent weeks. More than half the total asymptomatic cases reported from across the country on Sunday were in Zhengzhou, with the outbreak traced to a designated COVID-19 hospital. Anyone leaving Zhengzhou is now required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Meanwhile, Beijing has suspended all flights, trains, and buses from regions experiencing local outbreaks regardless of the number of cases. The capital city reported four confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday. While sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks occur frequently, China has largely managed to keep the virus at bay, with strict testing and quarantine procedures for international arrivals since last March. The current outbreak is China’s largest yet in terms of its geographical spread, and includes several regions across the country.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008154
China Strengthens Virus Control Measures Amid COVID-19 Flare Up,"The outbreak that began in Nanjing has since spread to several cities in multiple provinces, as local governments impose restrictions of movement and travel.",2021-07-30,"Several regions in China have rolled out strict measures to control the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak that started from the eastern city of Nanjing last week, as part of the country’s “zero-tolerance” approach to controlling the pandemic. As of Thursday, 185 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu province, in a fresh outbreak linked to the city’s airport cluster, according to the city’s health authorities. The virus linked to the city has now spread to at least eight provincial-level regions — including Anhui, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Guangdong — as well as the capital Beijing. On July 20, nine workers at Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus during a routine checkup. The infections were traced to workers who had cleaned an inbound flight from the Russian capital Moscow carrying an infected passenger, local health authorities said during a press conference Friday. Nanjing is testing its over 9 million people for the third time since the start of the latest outbreak, attributed to the highly infectious Delta variant. The city has shut down entertainment venues — including theaters — and advised residents to work from home, if possible. On Friday, the head of Nanjing’s transportation bureau said all domestic and international flights to and from the city had been suspended until further notice. All long-distance passenger buses have also been suspended since last week. Several cities are implementing strict preventive measures to curb the further spread of the virus as infections linked to the Nanjing cluster spill over to other locations. In Beijing, a residential community where a family of three tested positive for COVID-19 has been under “sealed management,” health officials said Thursday without elaborating. More than 400,000 people in the community and nearby residential compounds have also been ordered to stay put. The three people who tested positive for the virus in Beijing had traveled to Zhangjiajie — a major tourist city in central Hunan province — which has reported cases linked to the Nanjing airport cluster. At least 17 people who had returned from the mountainous tourist hot spot to their hometowns in the past week — including Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan province and Dalian in the northeast province of Liaoning — have been infected. On Thursday, local authorities in Zhangjiajie said the city would shut down all tourist attractions starting the following day, while indoor entertainment venues such as movie theaters and museums were closed immediately. Over 10,000 tourists were still in the city as of Thursday night, according to a city official. In the wake of the recent outbreaks, several cities with no COVID-19 cases have also been advising residents to avoid traveling outside their municipal and provincial borders, and encouraging vaccine uptake. Some cities like Shanghai now require domestic travelers coming or transiting through high-risk areas to have two nucleic acid tests for the virus and quarantine for 14 days at government-designated facilities. In an op-ed in financial outlet Caixin Global, Zhang Wenhong, director of the National Center of Infectious Diseases, said that the infections from Nanjing haven’t led to a large outbreak in other cities and provinces, which “indicates that the outbreak is still controllable.” He added that the city’s preventive measures could help reduce the infections in the coming weeks. “The latest outbreak in Nanjing once again reminds us of the ever-present virus,” he wrote. “Whether we like it or not, there will always be risks in the future. Each country is trying to find its own answer to the question — how will the world be able to live with the virus.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008139
"Study Favors Third Sinovac Shot, as China Faces COVID-19 Surge","A new study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, said an additional dose of the domestic-made vaccine could increase antibody levels to fight the coronavirus.",2021-07-29,"Chinese scientists have suggested an additional shot of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by domestic pharmaceutical company Sinovac could prove beneficial in the fight against the coronavirus. A third dose of the vaccine, dubbed CoronaVac, could increase antibody levels in fully vaccinated individuals by at least threefold if administered six or more months after receiving the recommended two shots, experts said in a new paper. The study was published Sunday as a preprint, meaning it hasn’t been vetted by independent experts. The small-scale trial involving 540 participants in China found a notable drop in their antibody levels six months after vaccination. Although the level of antibodies required to prevent COVID-19 is unclear, a higher antibody count is generally associated with stronger protection against viruses, according to an immunologist, who requested anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the media. “More antibodies circulating in the blood to fend off the virus means even if people get infected, they tend not to have symptoms, lowering the risk of spreading the virus to others,” the immunologist told Sixth Tone. The suggestion for a booster shot comes when China is facing a local outbreak in the eastern city of Nanjing, which experts have attributed to the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19. Since the first cases were identified among workers at the city’s international airport last week, the virus has now spread to at least 13 cities, including the capital Beijing. Many of the airport workers in Nanjing were said to be vaccinated, though it’s unclear which of the five approved vaccines they had received. Medical experts said the chance for infected patients to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms was “significantly lower.” CoronaVac is said to be about 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 and 86% in preventing COVID-19-related deaths among individuals 16 years or older, according to real world data from Chile. While Sunday’s study didn’t reveal if CoronaVac’s efficacy would change over time, data from other COVID-19 vaccines suggested diminishing protection over time. For example, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of the world’s most effective shots, fell from 96% to 84% over six months, a preprint published Wednesday revealed. As countries around the world battle recurrent surges in COVID-19, compounded by new variants, relaxed restrictions, and the waning efficacy of vaccines, governments in some high-income countries such as the United States and United Kingdom are weighing in on the need for booster shots. However, representatives at the World Health Organization (WHO) oppose the idea of booster shots, saying there isn’t enough evidence to suggest fully vaccinated people would require one for months. “It may well be that you need boosters after a year or two years,” the WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said earlier this month. “But at this point, at six months after the primary dose, there doesn’t seem to be any indication.” While discussions on a booster shot are gaining momentum in some countries, the disparity in access to vaccines continues to become more apparent. Only 1.1% of the population in low-income countries have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to Our World in Data.

Nanjing COVID-19 Outbreak Attributed to Delta Variant,Experts say most of the infected were vaccinated and the likelihood of developing severe health complications was “significantly lower.”,2021-07-28,"Authorities in the capital of eastern Jiangsu province are on high alert after the city logged more than 100 COVID-19 infections linked to a cluster at the city’s airport first identified last week. Nanjing had recorded 153 local confirmed cases as of Tuesday, with local authorities saying that infections in this new wave were “large and still increasing.” Officials have attributed the surge in cases to the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant. On July 20, nine people working at the Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the virus during a routine inspection. While the early confirmed cases were among the airport workers, infections have since spread to many other residents, including university dormitory administrators, teachers, and taxi drivers, authorities said. After two rounds of citywide testing within a week, Nanjing is to test its entire population of over 9 million residents for the third time since the airport cluster was identified.  Guo Guangying, a 55-year-old Nanjing resident who lives 20 kilometers from the airport, told Sixth Tone that she became anxious about the situation after a residential area nearby her parents’ apartment was sealed off as part of virus control measures. She said it was time to step up preventive measures once again. “It was noisy and hot, so many people pulled down their masks while waiting in the line,” she described of the scene at the COVID-19 test site. “Even now, old people sitting and chatting in the neighborhood without a mask.”  In the wake of the current outbreak, city authorities in Nanjing are intensifying their response to control the further spread of COVID-19, including mandatory negative virus tests for passengers using air, train, and ground transportation networks. This week, the city also suspended eight long-distance passenger buses, as well as shut karaoke venues, cinemas, and gyms. Medical experts said most of the infected individuals in Nanjing were vaccinated — China has only approved domestically manufactured vaccines for public usage so far — and the majority of cases only had relatively mild symptoms. They said the probability of the patients developing severe COVID-19 was “significantly lower.” Meanwhile, infections that originated in the Nanjing cluster have since spread to nearby cities Suqian and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, as well as at least four other provinces. Several cases have been reported in the provinces of southern Guangdong, southwestern Sichuan, and Liaoning in the northeast.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008110
"Nanjing Tests 9 Million Residents, Again, After 88 COVID-19 Cases",The latest outbreak has been linked to a cluster at the city’s airport.,2021-07-26,"The eastern city of Nanjing is testing its population of over 9 million people for the second time in a week after dozens of people were found infected with COVID-19, according to local authorities. As of Sunday, the capital city of Jiangsu province had logged in 88 COVID-19 cases in a fresh outbreak that has been linked to an airport cluster discovered last week, authorities said. The city tested its entire population for the virus after workers at the Nanjing Lukou International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday during a routine check. At least 57 people tested positive after the first round of the coronavirus tests, according to authorities. “People who have been infected don’t always immediately show symptoms. Some people are completely asymptomatic,” Yang Dasuo, deputy director of the city’s health commission, said on the need for another round of tests. An additional infection has been reported in the city of Suqian in Jiangsu, while four other provinces — Anhui, Liaoning, Guangdong, and Sichuan — have also logged cases linked to the Nanjing airport cluster. While cities such as Wuhu in Anhui province plan to test their entire population — a go-to method for many places as part of China’s zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 — and prohibit large social gatherings, some locations in Liaoning and Guangdong are only testing residents in high-risk areas, as well as close contacts of infected individuals. Meanwhile, in Nanjing, authorities have suspended all venues from hosting sporting and cultural events in the city’s Jiangbei New District until the outbreak is controlled. While China has largely controlled COVID-19, sporadic outbreaks often put authorities on high alert, leading to mass testing of communities. Most recently, Guangdong reported 153 confirmed cases in a new outbreak that started in late May, taking weeks for the province to stamp out the virus.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008088
China’s Health Authorities Criticize Bans on the Unvaccinated,"Amid a mounting backlash to harsh local vaccination rules, the National Health Commission has called for a pullback.",2021-07-17,"China’s top health authority criticized a series of coercive local vaccine mandates on Friday, stressing that inoculation against COVID-19 should be “voluntary.” The decision to get vaccinated should be “informed, consensual, and voluntary,” officials from China’s National Health Commission told state broadcaster CCTV. The NHC’s warning comes after a week in which local governments around the country announced harsh new restrictions on unvaccinated residents, including banning them from public spaces or, in the case of government workers, warning them that their vaccination status could affect their paychecks. Counties in several provinces declared that students — and in a few places, their entire families — must be fully vaccinated before the fall academic term. The mandates have triggered a backlash online, as social media users question whether the drive to boost China’s vaccination rates has gone too far. Experts, too, have criticized the policies, noting that banning students from school for not being vaccinated could violate Chinese law. Local officials are under intense pressure to prevent further outbreaks. A county-level education official told the Beijing News that they had been following orders from the local prevention and control authorities when they linked students’ access to school with their family’s inoculation records. “We have to do what the higher-level authorities tell us to do. Virus prevention and control is the most urgent current task,” the anonymous official was quoted as saying. Even prior to Friday’s CCTV report, several localities had already backtracked on their vaccine mandates. In Tanghe County in the central Henan province, for example, local government employees had been warned that not getting vaccinated could result in missed paychecks. Officials there now say they are “discussing” the policy among themselves, according to the Beijing News. China began offering domestically developed COVID-19 vaccines to its citizens for free last December. After a slow start, the vaccination drive, which is primarily reliant on two-dose vaccines, passed more than 1.4 billion shots Tuesday. In June, the central government estimated 70% of the population would be inoculated by the end of the year, or roughly 988 million people.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008018
"At Some Chinese Schools, Unvaccinated Students Are No Longer Welcome","More sticks and carrots have been announced, imploring people to get inoculated against COVID-19.",2021-07-15,"Hoping to boost local vaccination rates, more counties around China have announced restrictions for people not yet inoculated against COVID-19. While earlier moves targeted unvaccinated adults by banning them from public buildings such as hospitals and shopping malls, more recent announcements have said teenagers will need to be vaccinated to be allowed back to school after the summer. Pingxiang county, in the northern Hebei province, and several counties in the eastern Anhui province announced Wednesday that only fully vaccinated students aged 12 to 17 years old will be able to return for the new semester starting in September. County governments in four other provinces — Jiangxi, Guangxi, Henan, and Shaanxi — have said only students whose family members are all vaccinated against COVID-19 will be allowed to attend the fall semester. In another variation of such measures, counties in a different set of provinces — Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi — have said workers on government paychecks who won’t complete a full two-shot vaccination regimen as soon as possible will be held accountable along with their superiors. Some districts even included retired government workers among the people who will need to get inoculated or face consequences. Tanghe county, in the central Henan province, went as far as to say unvaccinated government employees could be suspended without pay unless they have a medical reason not to be vaccinated. In contrast to such penalties, other localities in the provinces Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi have proposed that vaccine recipients are rewarded with discounts at restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets. China has faced only relatively minor outbreaks of COVID-19 over the past year owing to mass-testing, centralized quarantine, and other strictly-enforced measures. The country’s vaccination campaign, using mostly two-shot COVID-19 vaccines, passed 1.4 billion shots on Wednesday. Tang Yao, assistant professor at the School of Administrative Law at Southwest University of Political Science and Law, told Sixth Tone that he thinks the announced policies are too strict considering that China’s vaccination rates are steadily rising. Though he added, “Their intentions are definitely applaudable.” Tang didn’t want to elaborate on the legality of some of the proposed measures, as he suspects officials are mostly just trying to scare people into getting their shots. “Personally, I don’t think they will be as strictly enforced as stated,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007997
Small Study Finds Mixing Chinese COVID-19 Vaccines Boosts Immunity,"Skepticism remains over whether combining vaccine technologies has any notable effect, and over whether it is safe.",2021-07-14,"JIANGSU, Eastern China — Mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines that use different technologies generates better immune responses than administering two shots of the same vaccine, a Chinese scientist said at a biomedical conference held in Suzhou on Sunday. The Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention is leading small-scale clinical trials where different vaccines are used together that, so far, have delivered promising initial results, it’s deputy director Zhu Fengcai said. Such research is important in part because some people have already received a mix of vaccines due to supply issues. It could also point to more effective ways to both inoculate people and reach herd immunity in populations. “It’s crucial to figure out how to [mix vaccines] scientifically,” Zhu said. Out of the four COVID-19 vaccines approved in China, two — those by Sinovac and Sinopharm — are made with an inactivated form of the virus and require a two-dose regimen. Another approved vaccine, dubbed Ad5-nCoV, requires only one shot. Ad5-nCoV elicits an immune response by delivering a viral particle into the body using a different and harmless virus as a vector — a technology similar to the one used by the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Based on the registration information of the Jiangsu center’s clinical trial, the study planned to enroll 100 volunteers who had received only one dose of an inactive vaccine. Half of them would then receive a second inactive shot, and the other half would get a dose of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine. Zhu said at the conference that people in the latter group had higher antibody levels than those who received two inactive shots. In addition, his team also found that participants who completed a two-dose inactive vaccine regimen and then received an additional Ad5-nCoV shot also had higher antibody levels than people who got a third inactive vaccine shot. A University of Oxford study looking into mixing Western-made COVID-19 vaccines that has yet to be peer-reviewed also found this can sometimes provoke a stronger immune response than standard regimens. An immunologist, who requested anonymity because he had been told by his university to not accept interviews, said that mixing COVID-19 vaccines developed with different technologies is risky and should not be promoted. “All the COVID-19 vaccines we are using worldwide are newly developed,” he told Sixth Tone. “We don’t even fully understand the safety of inoculating a single type of COVID-19 vaccine at the moment, not to mention mixing different ones.” He added that the stronger immune response from mixing inactive vaccines with Ad5-nCoV might not be due to the sum of both vaccines being greater than their parts. Rather, he suggested, it might be because the one-shot Ad5-nCoV carries more active ingredients than a single dose of a two-shot vaccine. While Chinese authorities haven’t recommended the mix-and-match approach, some countries, including the United Kingdom, are allowing people to get a different vaccine as the second shot if the original shot administered isn’t available, primarily due to supply bottlenecks. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also received two COVID-19 shots made with different technologies. Due to a lack of scientific evidence, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan warned individuals against mixing and matching different vaccines during an online news briefing Monday. “Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited - immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated,” she later wrote in a tweet. “I don’t think the Chinese study goes against the WHO recommendation,” Xie Youhua, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “There is a lack of data on mixing different vaccines, and with this study we may get some data.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007979
Chinese Counties to Ban Unvaccinated Adults From Public Facilities,"Soon, only people with at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine will be able to visit hospitals and take public transport.",2021-07-13,"Adults not vaccinated against COVID-19 will soon lose access to certain public buildings — including hospitals, schools, and shopping malls — as well as public transport in several eastern Chinese counties. Beginning on Friday, various local governments in the provinces Jiangxi and Zhejiang announced dates after which anyone aged 18 and over will need to show proof of having received at least one vaccination shot when entering public buildings. The earliest deadline for at least one shot, in the Zhejiang county Qingtian, is set on July 21. A month later, two shots will be required. People unable to take the vaccination because of medical reasons will be exempt. In certain counties in Shandong province, unvaccinated people showing up to public buildings will have their information recorded and told to get inoculated. Access to venues ranging from shopping malls and cinemas to airports and train stations across China already requires people to show a health QR code on their phone, proving they have not been to areas with known outbreaks. In May, Shandong added a golden trim to its provincial health code to indicate a person’s vaccinated status, at the time saying it was meant to encourage people to get inoculated. China is currently in the midst of a country-wide vaccination drive. As of Sunday, over 1.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines — many of which require two doses per person — had been administered. The Chinese government has set the target of fully vaccinating 64% of the population by the end of the year, and lower levels of government have been told to prioritize vaccinating as many people as possible. In many places, groceries such as rice and cooking oil are being gifted as encouragement. After China brought the initial outbreak in Wuhan under control, the country has only experienced sporadic and relatively small outbreaks, leading some people to question the necessity of getting vaccinated. Local infections were most recently reported this week in the southwestern province of Yunnan, and last month in Guangdong province, in southern China. On social media, people responded to the new measures with anger and confusion, calling them too rigid and abrupt. “In the beginning, they said (vaccination) was voluntary,” wrote one user of microblogging site Weibo. “Turns out it’s mandatory after all.” “I’m all for the measures,” wrote another Weibo user. But they said more clarifications were needed. “Will the health codes show when someone has a medical contraindication against getting vaccinated?” Jin Lifen, who lives near Qingtian county, told Sixth Tone she is concerned about the measures since she has not yet been vaccinated. A mother of two, she worries she won’t be able to bring her daughters to the doctor or to kindergarten. “I just heard the news, and now I’m anxious,” Jin said. “I guess I better go get vaccinated.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007976
"To Halt COVID-19, Chinese Border City Turns to Facial Recognition","Ruili, located across from Myanmar, hopes to curb coronavirus infections by closely tracking its more than 267,000 residents.",2021-07-12,"Ruili, a Chinese city on the Myanmar border currently trying to bring its fourth COVID-19 outbreak under control, says it has installed a citywide surveillance system that uses facial recognition cameras and other technological measures to track residents in an effort to stop further infections. At a press conference Saturday, the city’s COVID-19 prevention and control work command center said they had deployed a system linking each person to their facial data and a unique QR code so they can be tracked as they enter and exit residential areas and certain crowded facilities. “Digital security facilities such as facial recognition cameras, door locks, and road barriers have been put in place in key areas including transportation hubs, residential compounds, produce markets, and supermarkets. Everyone who comes in and out needs to have their [health] code and face scanned to pass,” a press release from the event said. QR health codes as well as facial recognition technology are already widely used in China, but the press release suggests Ruili has linked systems to form what it calls “one database, one code, one platform.” Ruili, which is located in southwest China’s Yunnan province, went into its third lockdown on July 5. By Sunday, citywide testing in Ruili had discovered 148 symptomatic cases, some of which were caused by viruses “highly homologous” to the more transmissible Delta variant. The source of the current outbreak is unknown, but Ruili’s mayor said Wednesday that the city’s long border with Myanmar makes it “a hotbed for cross-border transmission of COVID-19.” Nearly half of the new cases reported over the past week were Myanmar nationals, according to the daily health reports from the Yunnan Provincial Health Commission. The first case during an earlier COVID-19 outbreak in Ruili last September was a Myanmar national, according to Chinese authorities. Myanmar is currently experiencing a wave of COVID-19 infections. On Saturday, the country counted 4,377 new confirmed cases, a new high for the medically under-equipped nation that is also dealing with political unrest. Though the border is officially closed, crossings still take place. On Friday, media reported that over a dozen suspects were detained in Yunnan for smuggling Chinese nationals into Myanmar. In June, Ruili authorities announced they had detained an individual who had dug a tunnel to cross the border. Ruili has reportedly mobilized more than 7,000 police officers, militia, and local officials to oversee its nearly 170-kilometer-long border. China has also placed a barbed-wire fence along parts of the Yunnan side. It is unclear whether the newly announced surveillance database includes information about Myanmar nationals.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007957
"Sinovac’s COVID-19 Vaccine Found Safe for Children, Study Suggests",The trial showed that 3- to 17-year-olds had an immune response against the virus after the two-dose shot.,2021-06-29,"A Chinese COVID-19 vaccine has shown to be safe among children as young as 3, according to the result of a clinical trial published in the medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Minors who received a two-dose regimen of the Sinovac vaccine produced an immune response to fight against the virus that causes COVID-19, said the paper published Monday. The trial involved more than 500 minors between the ages of 3 and 17, none of whom reported serious adverse effects after vaccination. Earlier this month, Chinese authorities approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use in children and adolescents, though it didn’t specify which of the five approved shots would be used. However, Sinovac said that its shot, dubbed CoronaVac, has been green-lit for use among younger groups. Though some countries have included adolescents in their COVID-19 vaccination drive, China is the only country in the world to inoculate children as young as 3. Inoculation of China’s younger individuals, who account for a large share of the population, is therefore a critical step for the country to achieve herd immunity. According to The Lancet study, researchers plan to monitor the vaccinated group for at least a year to determine the shot’s long-term safety. China started using the Sinovac shots for adults in February, and it is the second Chinese-developed vaccine in the World Health Organization’s list of approved COVID-19 vaccines. CoronaVac is said to be about 51% effective in preventing COVID-19, according to a large-scale clinical trial in Brazil. Meanwhile, a real-world study in Chile showed the shots to be 67% effective.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007859
China’s Overseas Students Unsure How to Boost COVID-19 Immunity,"As university students head back abroad for the fall, they wonder whether to get booster shots months after first getting vaccinated.",2021-06-23,"Like many Chinese students heading back to countries with high COVID-19 infection rates, Chen Manqi wanted to get vaccinated before her anticipated return to Northwestern University in the U.S. for spring classes. In January, weeks after China approved Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine, the incoming third-year student from Shenzhen got her first of two shots. After a change of plans, Chen now looks to return to the U.S. in September, when Northwestern University, located in the state of Illinois, resumes in-person classes. However, unsure whether those shots from nearly half a year ago will still protect her, she and other Chinese students now face a conundrum. Though clinical trials have proven COVID-19 vaccines from various manufacturers to be safe and effective, it is mostly unclear how long they will provide protection because they have been in use for a relatively short period of time. Sinopharm Chairman Yang Xiaoming told state news agency Xinhua in January that their vaccines offer at least six months of immunity. As one of the first groups of people in the world to be vaccinated, Chen and her peers wonder when they will need to boost their immunity against COVID-19 and whether they can safely do so with a vaccine from a different manufacturer. Sinopharm and other Chinese vaccines are currently unavailable in the U.S. Chen told Sixth Tone she might get an antibody test before she leaves and a third Sinopharm shot if necessary. She added that she does not want to receive booster shots of a different vaccine. “I don’t think there has been any solid research or conclusion reached about the impact of mixing different vaccines, and I’m concerned that there might be side effects,” Chen told Sixth Tone. Health experts say mixing different vaccines should not be a problem but also stress that not enough clinical trials have been completed to prove its safety. “There is very little information about mixing the Chinese vaccines with those currently approved in the U.S.,” Northwestern Medicine cardiologist and geneticist Elizabeth McNally told Sixth Tone. The situation is further complicated because Chinese and American COVID-19 vaccines use different technologies, McNally explained. The former use inactivated viruses to train the body’s immune system; the latter use mRNA, a molecule carrying genetic information, to instruct cells to create specific proteins and achieve a similar effect. Incoming second-year student Xu Mingyang told Sixth Tone he received two shots of Sinopharm around March, and that he might get a third shot of Sinopharm in China before he leaves to continue his studies at Cornell University, in the state of New York. “I will not take the U.S. vaccines because I do not trust the potential cross-reactivity between two functionally different vaccines,” Xu said. Xu added that Cornell — like many schools in the United States — requires students to be vaccinated before returning to campus. Sinopharm is accepted by his university because the World Health Organization recognizes it, he said. Despite sharing these concerns, some Chinese students decided to get additional vaccinations in the U.S. Incoming Yale University fourth-year student Zhou Huahao told Sixth Tone that he got Sinopharm vaccines in January before he was due to travel to Connecticut, where COVID-19 infection rates were high at the time. After Zhou returned to the United States in May, he decided to get two shots of the Pfizer vaccine after testing for antibodies. “Nearly four months had passed since my Sinopharm shots, and it seemed my antibody level had dropped,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007801
Students Fret as Guangzhou Postpones Entrance Exam Over COVID-19,"More than 90,000 students have been affected by the decision to delay the “zhongkao” to an unspecified date.",2021-06-16,"Tens of thousands of students in Guangzhou preparing to take the high school-entrance exam next week will be required to wait a little longer, as the city has postponed the tests amid its COVID-19 outbreak. Gu Zhongpeng, deputy director of the city’s education bureau, said Monday that the zhongkao had been deferred for safety reasons to reduce people’s movements and avoid large gatherings given the area’s ongoing virus outbreak. He added that authorities will decide on the exams’ exact dates depending on the city’s epidemic response. “Due to infrastructure limitations, most junior high schools are not equipped to manage centralized on-campus living conditions,” Gu said. Over 90,000 students from nearly 500 schools in Guangzhou were scheduled to take this year’s zhongkao between June 20 and 22, according to local authorities. An additional 12,500 supervisors and test administrators were tasked with overseeing the students across over 156 exam sites citywide. The decision to postpone the exams has baffled many students and parents, as the city allowed over 53,000 students to sit for the college-entrance examination, or gaokao, last week while imposing strict health measures, including mandatory COVID-19 tests. “I still fell apart emotionally when I first heard the decision,” a student surnamed Yan who was preparing for the zhongkao told Sixth Tone on Wednesday, adding she felt she had “lost all momentum.” Though the gaokao is considered grueling and usually determines students’ entrance into the country’s elite higher education institutions, the zhongkao is an equally nerve-wracking series of tests that determines future academic prospects. “The zhongkao has an even higher elimination rate than the college-entrance exam,” Yan said. “If I can get into a top-tier high school, I’ve won half the battle of getting into a university. If I don’t get into a high school, the only choices left are vocational schools or ending my academic journey.” Since the city reported its first COVID-19 infection in the current outbreak on May 21, Guangzhou has counted 147 locally transmitted cases as of Monday, according to the local health authority. With infections on the decline, the city is gradually lifting several restrictions, including lockdowns that had been imposed on 11 areas across five districts.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007758
Hunan Man Detained for Flouting COVID-19 Quarantine Rules,The 47-year-old changed his phone number to book another train ticket so he could avoid staying indoors for another 14 days.,2021-06-10,"A man from the central province of Hunan was detained for five days after breaking COVID-19 quarantine rules, just as China is experiencing sporadic outbreaks. The man, surnamed Yin, deliberately changed his train booking using a separate phone number without informing the authorities to evade a second quarantine in his hometown of Hengyang County, local police said Wednesday. The 47-year-old had completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arriving in Guangzhou from Cambodia on May 12. China has enforced the mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated facilities for all international arrivals since the early days of the pandemic. However, local authorities in several locations have instituted their own rules, requiring people returning from abroad to spend additional time indoors after their initial quarantine. Upon finding Yin had skirted the virus-control policy in Hengyang, the 47-year-old was sent to a designated quarantine facility before being detained, according to local police. His family members were also tested for the virus to rule out any possible infections. In March, China passed a law making it a criminal offense to hide travel histories or hinder virus-control efforts, with violators facing up to seven years in prison. Last April, a man in the central Henan province was jailed for 18 months for breaking quarantine rules in the country’s first such case. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, police in the southern Guangdong province — currently witnessing a COVID-19 outbreak — said at least a dozen people had been either detained or arrested for flouting pandemic-control measures. They were held accountable for various reasons, including going fishing and visiting infected parents, ultimately breaking the rules.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007726
"China Approves COVID-19 Vaccination for Children, CCTV Says","While the government plans to inoculate 3- to -17-year-olds, there is no definite timeline yet.",2021-06-08,"China has approved a COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use among children and adolescents, days after a senior government official suggested the country was considering such a move. An unnamed official from China’s COVID-19 vaccine development task force told state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) Sunday that the inoculation drive will include children aged 3 to 17, and the vaccines will be administered from eldest to youngest. However, it’s unclear which of the five approved shots has been greenlighted for use among children and teens. The approval would make China the only country to vaccinate children under 12, though it’s unclear when the inoculations will start. Several countries, including Canada, the United States, and Chile, have approved the use of COVID-19 vaccines for adolescents in recent months. Last week, chairman of Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac told CCTV that their COVID-19 vaccine had received government approval for use among 3- to 17-year-olds. China’s drug regulator, however, hasn’t made any such announcements yet. Sinovac has conducted a small-scale human trial of its COVID-19 vaccine in minors, involving about 500 participants between the ages of 3 and 17. The study, published as a preprint yet to be vetted by independent experts, has shown the vaccine to be safe and able to elicit an immune response in recipients. But the shot’s effectiveness, usually determined in large-scale human studies involving thousands of volunteers, remained unclear. Research shows children are less likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19. However, including that demographic in the vaccination program could raise the country’s currently low vaccine coverage, as the group accounts for a sizable share of China’s population. As of Tuesday, China had administered over 790 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, but under 20% of residents are said to be fully vaccinated.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007699
China Mulls Vaccinating Children and Teenagers Against COVID-19,A senior government official said young people would be next in line in the country’s inoculation drive.,2021-06-04,"China is considering giving COVID-19 vaccines to children and adolescents — despite the country having not yet released detailed data involving the target population — as the country ramps up its vaccination drive amid sporadic outbreaks that have put authorities on high alert. Feng Zijian, a deputy director-general at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said authorities were now working on the next phase of inoculating the under-18 population without giving a specific timeline, domestic media reported. Currently, China’s inoculation drive mostly involves people aged 18 to 59, with some cities vaccinating those over 60. “Right now, the government is very seriously, actively, and cautiously researching the next stage of its inoculation plan, policies, and services,” Feng said during a conference held in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Wednesday, adding that the authority would start inoculating adolescents and children, after the elderly. While COVID-19 vaccines developed in China haven’t been granted approval for adolescent use, the United States has authorized its Pfizer vaccines for use in those aged 12-15. Feng’s remarks come as China faces a fresh outbreak in the southern Guangdong province. As of Thursday, the local health authority had reported over 50 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases since the outbreak began late May. Research suggests children under 14 are less likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19, but the group makes up about 18% of China’s total population. They are an essential demographic for the country to achieve herd immunity, a scenario where at least 70% of the population has become immune to the virus either through infection or vaccination based on current estimations. By Thursday, China had administered over 700 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with less than 20% of the population fully vaccinated, according to Zhang Wenhong, an infectious disease specialist heading Shanghai’s coronavirus response. State-owned pharmaceutical companies Sinovac and Sinopharm said that their vaccines — which are now approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use in those aged 18 and up — have shown to be safe in children and can elicit immune responses. A small-scale clinical trial of the vaccine in 500 children aged 3-17 showed the vaccine to be safe and capable of eliciting an immune response, a researcher with Sinovac said during a conference in March, without releasing detailed data. Meanwhile, Sinopharm’s chairman told state-run Xinhua in January that they have “solid clinical trial data that shows (the COVID-19 vaccine) can be given to people from 3 to 17 years old with no safety issues.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007675
Sinovac Becomes Second Chinese COVID-19 Vaccine to Get WHO Approval,The approval of another shot is likely to accelerate vaccinations in countries lagging in their inoculation rates due to limited supply.,2021-06-02,"The World Health Organization on Tuesday approved a second Chinese COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, less than a month after it greenlighted the first shot developed in the country. The vaccine, dubbed CoronaVac, is developed by Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac. It is the eighth vaccine added to the WHO’s growing list of shots in a bid to combat the pandemic that has so far killed more than 3.5 million people globally. “The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” Dr. Mariângela Simão, WHO assistant-director general for access to health products, said in a press release. In early May, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by state-owned Sinopharm became the first Chinese shot to be approved by the WHO for emergency use. Other vaccines validated by the global health body include shots from AstraZeneca, as well as Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, both of which have mostly been used in high-income countries. Sinovac’s inclusion on the list of approved vaccines means the shots will be added to the Covax program, a global alliance led by the WHO that aims to make COVID-19 vaccines accessible in low- and middle-income nations. China joined Covax in October of last year. China approved CoronaVac for domestic use in February and it has since been a large part of the country’s inoculation drive. The vaccine has also been used in other countries including Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Thailand. According to the WHO, the Sinovac vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in more than half of those who received the shot and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population. “Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings,” the WHO said in its press release. CoronaVac can be kept at a standard refrigerator temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, making it much easier to store and distribute than some other vaccine candidates that require low-temperature storage. While the WHO recommended the shot for people aged 18 and above, it recognized that the number of elderly involved in CoronaVac’s clinical trials was limited. “Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group,” the organization said. “However, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected … suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.” The WHO’s nod of approval for Chinese-developed vaccines implies that people who received either the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine could travel to countries in the European Union. Last month, the bloc decided to reopen its borders to visitors who have been fully vaccinated with shots approved by the WHO. People Visual)",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007652
"Guangzhou Halts Vaccination, Ramps Up Testing Amid Virus Outbreak",Health authorities attributed the recent uptick in infections to the more transmissible coronavirus strain.,2021-06-01,"Guangzhou has suspended individual COVID-19 vaccine appointments to focus more on mass testing key groups amid a fresh outbreak that has put the city on high alert. During a press conference Monday, the city’s vice mayor Li Ming said the recent COVID-19 flare-up has made it necessary to “concentrate energy and resources on nucleic acid testing” and “adjust the pace of COVID-19 vaccination.” The announcement came as local residents were rushing to get COVID-19 shots during the uptick of infections. Li said the suspension of appointments was to reduce infection risks, as inoculation sites had been “inundated” with people. Tao Lina, a vaccine expert based in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone it isn’t surprising for local governments to prioritize testing to contain the spread of the virus, as vaccines take longer to be effective. He added that the crowds at inoculation sites could increase infection risks. “Emergency situations still rely on strengthened testing and quarantine,” Tao said. As of Monday, over 3 million out of the city’s 15 million people had been fully vaccinated. The city is now prioritizing vaccinations for key groups and industries — though unspecified — while individual appointments will resume, pending the outbreak situation, Li said. Since the first locally transmitted coronavirus case in this outbreak was identified on May 21, Guangzhou has reported 42 infections as of Monday, including 34 confirmed and eight asymptomatic cases. China, however, does not include asymptomatic patients in its national tally of COVID-19 cases. Local health authorities have attributed the flare-up to the more transmissible B.1.617 strain of the novel coronavirus, which was first identified in India. Guangzhou has implemented travel restrictions, ordering people leaving the city via public transportation to provide a negative nucleic acid test.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007644
Guangzhou on High Alert Amid COVID-19 Outbreak,This is the city’s first flare-up in more than nine months since its last local transmission was reported.,2021-05-31,"Guangzhou, a city of 15 million residents, is setting restrictions for those planning to leave after local health authorities reported over two dozen coronavirus infections in the past week.  On Monday, local authorities ordered anyone leaving Guangzhou via public transportation — including trains, airplanes, and buses — to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test result, with an exception for transit passengers. Some 519 flights — accounting for nearly 40% of the total flights in and out of the city — were also cancelled, according to domestic financial outlet Caixin. The city’s health commission has attributed the latest outbreak to the B.1.617 strain of the novel coronavirus, which was found to be dominant among the recently reported infections, the statement said. There is growing evidence that the B.1.617 variant, first identified in India and has since devastated the South Asian country, is more transmissible than other known strains that cause COVID-19. The latest uptick in COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou is the first time in more than nine months since the city reported its last local transmission. The first identified case from the recent outbreak was reported on May 21 after a 75-year-old woman visited a local hospital for a fever and tested positive for the virus. A few days later, the patient’s husband, as well as a restaurant worker who had served the woman a week before and a customer at the same restaurant also tested positive for the virus. Following the outbreak, local authorities have ordered mass testing of all residents living in several districts who might have come in contact with the infected patients. As of Sunday, Guangzhou had reported 30 COVID-19 cases. Ryan Zhang, a 20-year-old resident in Guangzhou, told Sixth Tone that he hadn’t noticed any major changes in the city since the outbreak was first reported apart from minor disruptions in public transport around some districts where the outbreaks have been reported. “We aren’t really worried about this new Indian variant — with a swift response and effective collaboration, the situation should be under control soon,” he said. Meanwhile, education authorities in Guangzhou have ordered all students preparing for the national college entrance examination, or gaokao, as well as school staff to stay on campus if dormitories are available. While the exams were postponed due to the pandemic last year, they are scheduled to start June 7 this year. All other students have been asked to stay at home, while in-person classes for grades 10 and 11 were cancelled and moved online starting Monday. Amid the recent flare-up, Guangzhou has also seen a growing demand for COVID-19 vaccines. Many inoculation sites have seen long lines and have suspended walk-in vaccination programs, asking residents to book appointments online in advance, domestic media reported. “The vaccine has been available for the past few months, but I’ve heard very few people went to get it because there was no rush,” Zhang said. “Now, suddenly people are rushing to receive the vaccine, so it’s been difficult to reserve one. Weekends have been especially crowded since those who work are only available on weekends.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007621
"Chinese COVID-19 Vaccines Over 70% Effective, Study Finds",The findings involving two vaccines from state-run pharmaceutical company Sinopharm are the first Chinese shots to be vetted by independent experts and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.,2021-05-28,"Two Chinese-manufactured vaccines have shown to be over 70% effective in preventing COVID-19, according to a study Wednesday in a prestigious American medical journal. Researchers published their findings from the late-stage trials involving two vaccines from state-run pharmaceutical company Sinopharm in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Both shots were made with the same technology but different ingredients, and were developed separately by the company’s laboratories in Beijing and Wuhan. “(The) vaccines significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and serious adverse events were rare,” the study said. The shot developed by the Beijing lab has shown to be about 78% effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus infections, and the one from Wuhan was 72% effective, according to the study. The results are the first data from large-scale human trials involving Chinese COVID-19 vaccines to be vetted by independent experts and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The JAMA study included results from several clinical trials involving some 40,000 participants in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. About 26,000 participants received vaccines made in either Beijing or Wuhan, while the rest were given a placebo. The efficacy of the vaccine from Sinopharm Beijing was consistent with data the World Health Organization reviewed earlier this month. The WHO had approved the Beijing-developed vaccine for emergency use on May 7, while the shot from the Wuhan lab received the green light for public use in China on Feb. 25. According to the researchers, 84% of the participants in the JAMA study were men, while over 98% of them were 18 to 59 years old. The clinical trials included only around 600 individuals aged 60 or older, who tend to be at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 or dying from the disease. Last month, another COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinovac released detailed data from its late-stage trial in Brazil in a preprint paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed. The study showed the shot to be around 50% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. China has approved five domestically manufactured coronavirus vaccines for emergency or public use. As of Wednesday, the country had administered over 560 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines — the most in the world — and is aiming to inoculate 40% of its population by the end of June.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007609
Chinese Abroad Caught Faking COVID-19 Tests to Return Home,Three men and the companies they work for in Nigeria have been temporarily barred from applying for health codes needed for passage to China.,2021-05-21,"The Chinese Consulate in Lagos has announced punishments for two domestic companies based in Nigeria after their employees committed COVID-19 test fraud in order to return to China. According to the consulate’s notice on Thursday, the three men had fraudulently obtained negative IgG antibody test results for COVID-19 when applying for their health codes — a sort of digital passport used by China to trace infections and gauge an individual’s public health risk. The consulate said the men would be barred from applying for health codes for two months, effectively preventing them from returning to China during this time. “Their behavior violated China’s law on epidemic prevention and could have presented enormous health risks to the other passengers on their flight,” the consulate said. While China has managed to bring the coronavirus to heel within its borders, the country’s still-low vaccination rate means most people remain vulnerable to contagious cases arriving from abroad. As a result, borders between China and other countries have been slow to reopen, and public health measures for citizens seeking to return are rigorous. In addition to negative nucleic acid tests, some embassies and consulates require would-be travelers to obtain negative antibody tests. For a time, this presented a problem for people who had fully recovered after contracting COVID-19 but still had antibodies against the virus circulating in their bodies. As a workaround for this group, the Chinese Consulate in Lagos accepts CT scans showing no signs of lingering infection. According to Thursday's notice, the three men’s two employers have also been punished, their staff now barred from applying for health codes for two weeks. The consulate further warned that any behavior by citizens abroad that endangers outbreak control efforts, including tampering with COVID-19 tests or having healthy imposters get tested on behalf of others, would be strictly punished. Earlier this week, another Chinese national living abroad was convicted of fabricating his COVID-19 test result when he applied for a health code to return to China last December. The man, who was diagnosed with the disease soon after landing, received a one-year suspended sentence, the Chinese Embassy in Russia said Tuesday. Since being introduced in February 2020, China’s app-based health codes — green for healthy people, or yellow or red for at-risk individuals — have become a ubiquitous tool for domestic travel, with many businesses and tourist sites requiring visitors to flash their green health codes upon entry. Earlier this month, some province-level regions added a gold code for their fully vaccinated residents. In addition to Chinese authorities holding people and companies accountable for risky behavior, last year China’s civil aviation authority announced it would punish and reward airlines — adding or taking away routes — based on whether they were allowing healthy or sick people into the country.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007536
"COVID-19 Clusters in Anhui, Liaoning Traced to Photography Workshop",The 29 new positive cases across two provinces represent China’s largest coronavirus outbreak in over a month.,2021-05-17,"China reported more than two dozen new coronavirus infections over the weekend, a relatively large spike that has raised concerns over the country’s low vaccination rate. Health authorities in the eastern Anhui province announced Friday that a resident who had visited a local clinic for unspecified reasons tested positive for COVID-19. A few hours later, a close contact of the patient was also found to have contracted the disease. An epidemiological survey revealed that the second patient had, in late April, attended a photography workshop in the northeastern province of Liaoning, where more COVID-19 cases were identified over the weekend. As of Monday, China’s National Health Commission had reported a total of 29 linked cases in Anhui and Liaoning. This represents the country’s largest outbreak since early April, when over 100 people in the southwestern Yunnan tested positive for the virus. The source of the recent outbreak is still under investigation. Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper that while the first patients were identified in Anhui, the cluster may have started in Liaoning because all of the cases identified so far are linked to the same photography event, held in Liaoning’s port city of Yingkou. According to Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease specialist heading up Shanghai’s coronavirus response, none of the cases from Liaoning or Anhui had been vaccinated against COVID-19. “The global vaccine rollout is really slow and imbalanced,” he wrote Sunday on microblogging platform Weibo. “But it’s normal to see (people still aren’t vaccinated) around the world. Even in countries where the vaccine supply is sufficient, it’s still hard to reach an immunity level that can cut off transmission.” According to domestic media, thousands of residents in Anhui have registered to get vaccinated since the outbreak was reported. In the province’s capital city of Hefei, high turnout of people hoping to get vaccinated led to a new record for shots administered in a single day. As of Sunday, China had administered 406 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007478
"Chinese COVID-19 Vaccine 94% Effective in Medical Workers, Indonesia Says","A previous trial in Brazil had found that the Sinovac-developed vaccine’s efficacy rate was just over 50%, but experts say this discrepancy isn’t surprising and shouldn’t be overinterpreted.",2021-05-13,"Health officials in Indonesia said that a Chinese vaccine is 94% effective in preventing COVID-19 among medical workers in its capital city, Bloomberg reported. At a press conference Wednesday, Pandji Dhewantara, an official with Indonesia’s health ministry and the trial’s lead researcher, said that from January to March, authorities had been monitoring 128,290 medical workers in Jakarta who received CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccine made by Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac. The results showed that the shot, which was approved in Indonesia in January, was 98% effective in preventing death from COVID-19 within this population. In addition, Indonesian officials said the vaccine was 94% effective in protecting the health care workers from symptomatic cases — a far higher figure than those of previous large-scale clinical trials. In one such trial conducted in Brazil, the Sinovac vaccine was 50.7% effective in preventing coronavirus infection in nearly 13,000 participants. That data has been released as a preprint study and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona, told Sixth Tone that the discrepancy between the Indonesia and Brazil clinical trial results isn’t surprising. “Analysis among health care workers isn’t really representative,” he said, as this specific population is more likely to wear masks and practice good hygiene, among other behaviors that reduce infection risks. “But honestly, the effectiveness of a vaccine is likely to change because the virus is changing,” Wang said. Experts have expressed great concerns about the many novel coronavirus mutations that are emerging around the world. So far, there is insufficient data to indicate whether the variants will dent the vaccines’ established efficacy rates. “There’s no point in comparing real-world numbers to the clinical trial results,” Wang said. “What we need to focus on, for example, is whether the death toll is rising, or if people need to be hospitalized and put on ventilators.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007442
Chinese Firm Signs Deal to Produce Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine,Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group will produce 1 billion doses of the mRNA vaccine annually that’s 95% effective in preventing COVID-19.,2021-05-10,"A Shanghai-based pharmaceutical company is planning to produce a COVID-19 vaccine with one of the highest known efficacy rates after sealing a deal with its foreign counterpart.  The deal between Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group and its German partner BioNTech will allow for the domestic production of 1 billion doses of the messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines annually, the Chinese company said Sunday in a stock filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The mRNA vaccine was co-developed by BioNTech and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and is 95% effective in preventing COVID-19. Fosun Pharma will inject a maximum of $100 million into its joint venture with BioNTech to build factories and facilities, while the German company will provide the patent and technological know-how for producing its vaccine, the statement said. Fosun Pharma has exclusive rights to supply the vaccine in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. On Monday, BioNTech also announced plans to set up its regional headquarters in Singapore and establish an integrated mRNA manufacturing unit in the country. The Singapore facility will “provide regional and global supply capacity” as well as “rapid response production capability,” the company said. While Hong Kong and Macao have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the shot has yet to receive the green light on the Chinese mainland. The Wall Street Journal, citing Chinese officials, reported last month that China is likely to approve the shot by the end of July, making it the first foreign COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for the mainland. So far, China has approved five domestically manufactured vaccines. By Sunday, it had administered over 317 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines — the most of any country, followed by the United States — and plans to inoculate 40% of its population by the end of June. Globally, over 1.29 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered, according to Bloomberg, with many developed countries leading the global vaccination drive. However, the World Health Organization has criticized the “shocking imbalance” of the global vaccine rollout, as poorer countries have far less access to shots despite, in many cases, far greater need. Earlier this month, the U.S. said it would support easing patent rules for COVID-19 vaccines, which could facilitate their global distribution. But such a move is opposed by pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, as well as countries such as Germany.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007409
WHO Approves First Chinese COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use,"While Sinopharm’s product is less effective than some vaccines developed in the West, the fact that it is easier to store and distribute could make it a practical choice for less-developed countries.",2021-05-08,"The World Health Organization on Friday approved a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, a validation that could expedite the approval and distribution of the shot worldwide. The vaccine, dubbed BBIBP-CorV, is manufactured by the Chinese state-backed pharmaceutical company Sinopharm. It is the first COVID-19 vaccine from China and the sixth globally to receive WHO backing. Previously, the organization had approved shots made by U.S.-based Moderna and German firm BioNTech for emergency use. The designation will allow China to start providing vaccines to Covax, a global partnership led by the WHO that aims to send COVID-19 shots to less-developed countries. The Chinese government announced it would join Covax last October. “The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate COVID-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk,” Dr. Mariângela Simão, the WHO’s assistant director-general for access to health products, said in a press release. With most rich countries launching ambitious inoculation drives to vaccinate their residents, those living in poorer countries are still waiting for shots. During a recent meeting, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that 82% of all shots administered worldwide had gone to high- or upper middle-income countries, while only 0.2% had been sent to low-income nations. “Vaccine equity is the challenge of our time,” Tedros said during the meeting. “And we are failing.” According to Friday’s announcement, the authorization is based on evidence provided to the WHO’s expert committee which suggested that the Sinopharm vaccine is 78.1% effective in preventing COVID-19. While Sinopharm has not released detailed data from its large-scale human trials of BBIBP-CorV, the expert committee published the data this week. Although the WHO recommends the vaccine for all adults over 18 years old, only a few participants older than 60 were enrolled in Sinopharm’s clinical trials. Despite the committee being unable to determine the vaccine’s efficacy among seniors, the WHO’s authorization includes this age group because preliminary data suggests “the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.” Chinese regulators approved BBIBP-CorV for the general public in December. Though its efficacy rate is lower compared with vaccines made by Moderna and others, the Sinopharm shot is easier to store and distribute. So far, it has been authorized in over 45 countries and jurisdictions. CoronaVac, another Chinese vaccine made by Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac, is still waiting for WHO approval after being assessed alongside BBIBP-CorV at the same meeting last week.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007404
I Got the Vaccine. Why Are So Many Chinese Still Hesitating?,"Getting vaccinated is an almost painless process in much of China, yet many continue to vacillate.",2021-05-06,"I was midway through lunch with some friends when I got the call: “Hello, I’m with your residential committee. Want to get vaccinated?” Oddly, the group had been in the middle of a discussion on the merits of vaccination when I’d picked up. Then again, perhaps it wasn’t such a coincidence. Vaccinations were one of the hottest topics in China last month, as the country ramped up efforts to expand its underwhelming vaccination numbers. The person on the other end of the phone assured me that I could get my shot without leaving my neighborhood, and that there was no need to wait in line. “Uhh… fine,” I finally replied, more out of civility than enthusiasm. I’m not an anti-vaxxer; like many Chinese, the only reason I hadn’t gotten the shot was because I didn’t want to deal with all the hassle. “Then just tell me when works best for you! Is tomorrow convenient? The day after is fine as well! Or perhaps now?” The chipper voice on the other line was starting to feel a bit oppressive, but I made an appointment for 8:30 the next morning, saying I would stop by after dropping my kids off at school. “Great!” the woman replied, before asking if I wanted to bring my parents along for good measure. Finally, the call ended, but as I returned to my lunch, my mind was preoccupied by the noise of China’s state machinery rumbling to life. All things considered, it sounded cheerier than I expected. It’s no secret that China’s vaccination campaign has been slow going. Although it has given out more than 280 million shots as of May 6, that is far from enough to achieve herd immunity in a country of 1.4 billion, especially when the vaccinations approved for use here all require two doses to be effective. Experts have expressed anxiety at the rollout’s slow start. In late March, Zhang Wenhong, the head of the infectious disease department at the prestigious Huashan Hospital in Shanghai and a star of China’s anti-coronavirus campaign, weighed in with a characteristically blunt assessment. “The developed countries are currently completing vaccinations quickly, and they will reopen once they have finished,” he declared at a press conference in the central city of Wuhan. “If the United States, the EU, and Japan reopen, but our country continues to be closed off, the impact on the economy and the public psyche will be far greater than the damage caused by the pandemic. And when our country is reopened (to international travelers), Chinese who have not yet been vaccinated will suffer and will be worried wherever they go.”  What’s behind the lagging figures? Ironically enough, the country may be the victim of its own success against the pandemic. To paraphrase Laozi, good can come from ill, and ill from good: After bringing a devastating outbreak under control in early 2020, China basically returned to normal last spring. Now many Chinese, absent the pressure of ongoing community transmission, are in no rush to go get vaccinated, even if it puts them at risk later. More surprising, however, is the Chinese government’s relatively lassez faire approach to vaccinations, at least so far. After a year in which the state adopted whatever “hardcore” measures it deemed necessary to eliminate outbreaks before they could spread, it has largely left the work of vaccinations in the hands of grassroots workers like the residential committee member who contacted me last month. Curious what life is like for the so-called grid workers tasked with getting China vaccinated, I reached out to Su Rong, a friend of mine and an influential party secretary of a residential committee in Shanghai. She explained to me that most of the vaccine hesitancy she’s encountered in her work is based on cold calculation, rather than fear. “People who are reluctant to get vaccinated have different reasons. Some are afraid of the risks or side effects, some doubt the quality of domestic vaccines, and many of them are just being selfish,” Su said. According to her, many residents simply calculate that, to achieve herd immunity, not everyone needs to get the vaccine. Without an outbreak or public pressure, they would prefer others get the shot while they put it off as long as they can. There’s also concern that new mutations of the coronavirus will make the current vaccines less useful in the long run, and they see little point in being vaccinated for nothing.  The work of Su and other community staff doesn’t end with convincing people to take the shot, either, and this is where China’s vaccination campaign may have an edge over those run by other nations. These workers schedule residents for vaccinations, coordinate with sites to minimize waiting times, accompany residents to get their shots, and sometimes even provide them with water and snacks. Then they do it all again for the second shot, while also making sure that residents’ appointed site has the same vaccine the second day as the first. At a time when developed countries are struggling to get people back for their second dose of the vaccine — whether by design, as in the U.K., or just a lack of urgency or awareness — Su and her colleagues at the grassroots level of society are helping China avoid falling into the same trap. It’s exhausting work, but it does make everything that much easier for residents. When I got my shot, I was met at a nearby intersection by the woman who had called me, who then walked me down to the vaccination site. Within five minutes of arriving, I was finished and relaxing in the observation room.  Still, sitting there, I couldn’t help but wonder if this gentle, upbeat approach could really get China to herd immunity. Mobilizing community workers to get people vaccinated certainly results in a pleasant, personalized process, but the side effect is a patchwork of initiatives and incentives, and not all community workers are equally well trained and experienced. The approaches communities across the country are using to boost vaccination rates can range from the well-intentioned to the curious or even unprofessional. Some cities are giving away eggs, oil, soap, and other necessities as rewards. At Beijing’s Baiyun Temple vaccination site, people may visit the temple for free with their vaccination voucher, where they can rub the temple’s famous stone monkey reliefs. Walk down the streets in Shanghai and you’ll likely hear at least one loudspeaker blaring an offer for vaccinations like the city’s running a clearance sale: “Free shots! Come and get them!” Elsewhere in the city, the famous girl group SNH48 is offering fans who agree to get vaccinated at their dedicated event space a unique stamp from group members in place of pre-pandemic activities like handshake sessions.  These promotions are harmless, and some are almost touching, but are they really effective? My musings were interrupted when two delivery couriers sitting next to me in the room asked the volunteers on duty if they could leave before their mandatory 30-minute post-shot observation period was over. After being told they would have to wait, the pair returned to their seats, looking anxious. We struck up a conversation, and they explained that their delivery company requires them to pick up every order within an hour of it being placed. They couldn’t afford to sit in a room doing nothing for 30 minutes. When their 30 minutes had passed, they jumped up and shot out of the room like arrows, leaving me sitting in stunned silence. It was another irony. Some of us have the ability to wait around and debate the merits of various vaccines. Others, like the delivery drivers who kept the country running in the depths of the COVID-19 outbreak last year, don’t have that luxury. They run some of the highest risks of infection of anyone, yet we can’t even give them 35 minutes to get vaccinated. Instead we drag our feet and moan about the inconvenience. Before I followed them out the door, I took a picture of the observation room and sent it to a friend who I knew still hadn’t been vaccinated. “I just got it and it’s fine,” I added in a text. “You should go and get it, too.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007391
Chinese Province Launches Gold ‘Health Code’ for Vaccine Recipients,"The digital reward is designed to motivate young people to get vaccinated, according to local authorities.",2021-05-04,"China has been using digital “health codes” to track and trace COVID-19 infections since the start of the pandemic. Now, local officials want to turn them into a fashion item. Hundreds of millions of people have downloaded health code systems onto their smartphones, giving Chinese authorities access to their location and other personal data. People are often still required to show a green code — indicating they haven’t been in close contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus — when entering banks, hotels, and many other venues. Now, eastern China’s Shandong province plans to integrate an extra feature into its health code system, which will show whether a person is fully vaccinated, local authorities announced Monday. Those who have completed their course of shots will have a golden border placed around their green code, as well as a small icon showing a needle and shield in the upper left corner. The initiative is effectively an attempt to gamify China’s vaccination program, encouraging young people to go get a jab, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. It’s designed to be a low-cost way to promote Shandong’s vaccination drive by catering to people’s desires to “unlock new achievements,” the agency commented Monday.  In Shandong, the health code mini-program on Chinese social app WeChat was upgraded on Monday, local authorities said. All other health code systems in the province are expected to be upgraded by the end of the week. China has been accelerating its vaccination program in recent weeks. The country had administered over 275 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Sunday, compared with just under 134 million a month ago, according to the National Health Commission. On Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, the new system has generally received a positive reception, with several users commenting the golden code looks “awesome” and urging the government to roll out the upgrade nationwide. Some, however, have questioned how useful the new feature will be in practice. Ken Cari, an American who has been living in Shandong for over a decade, told Sixth Tone the new codes appeared “useless,” as many venues no longer bother to check people’s health codes. No new locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 have been reported on the Chinese mainland for several weeks, and most Chinese cities have relaxed their previously tight virus-control measures. In recent weeks, Cari said he had traveled to several cities in Shandong and to Beijing, but he hadn’t had his health code checked once. “If they’re going to make it gold to try and incentivize people to get the vaccine, they should be better at actually checking the code,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007379
"Shanghai Offers Locals Cash, Groceries to Get COVID-19 Vaccine",The city is just the latest in China to offer incentives as the country strives to inoculate 40% of its population by June.,2021-04-30,"Some districts in Shanghai are now offering a variety of incentives, including cash rewards, to encourage more residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as China ramps up its mass inoculation campaign. Residents who got the vaccine have also been receiving handouts ranging from money to rice to cooking oil, according to screenshots of the campaign circulating on social media this week. However, none of the city’s districts have officially publicized the incentives, and the northern Yangpu District on Tuesday dismissed claims that it was offering a chance at a free staycation in a five-star hotel and tickets to the upcoming China Flower Expo to residents who got their jabs. Zhu Chenxi, a local college student, said he was able to get 180 yuan ($28) after receiving his first dose of the vaccine Tuesday in Baoshan District. The 18-year-old said he’d heard about the offer from a friend and had traveled over an hour to get vaccinated in the district. “I didn’t plan to get the vaccine right away, as I didn’t feel there was any rush,” Zhu told Sixth Tone. “I still would have got the shot even if there wasn’t any such offer, just not now.” Zhu said he received the money through online payment app Alipay the day after his inoculation appointment. By Wednesday, China had administered over 243.9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, more than any country in the world. China plans to vaccinate 40% of its population by the end of June, but experts say reaching herd immunity could still be a long way off, given the campaign’s modest pace so far. The incentives in Shanghai are the latest example of local governments trying to persuade residents who, with no major domestic outbreaks in weeks, aren’t in a rush to get vaccinated, even as public health officials are urging them to do so. The island province of Hainan announced a 150 yuan “travel subsidy” as a reward for getting the shots, while Beijing’s Daxing District offered supermarket vouchers. However, such incentives are not limited to Chinese cities. While Moscow served up ice cream to encourage residents to get COVID-19 shots, restaurants in Dubai gave discounts for vaccinated diners. The U.S. state of West Virginia even announced a $100 savings bond in return for getting the vaccine this week. According to a joint survey by domestic media outlet Southern Weekly and Dingxiangyuan, an online platform for health professionals, 81% of some 12,600 respondents said they were willing to get a shot. And a global Ipsos-World Economic Forum survey indicated that people in China are among the most determined to get a COVID-19 vaccine, with their only hesitation stemming from the perceived minimal risk of contracting the disease in the country.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007348
US Relaxes Entry Restrictions on Students Traveling From China,"Finally, Chinese people traveling to America for school won’t have to take a 14-day detour in a country not affected by the Trump administration’s travel bans.",2021-04-28,"After more than a year in limbo, Chinese international students may soon be able to attend American universities by traveling directly from their home country. In a notice published Monday, the U.S. State Department said students from China and several other countries and regions, as well as certain academics participating in visitor exchange programs, can now qualify for a National Interest Exception (NIE) allowing them to travel to the United States. Other groups covered include journalists and those “seeking to provide vital support for critical infrastructure.” Chinese students with valid F-1 or M-1 visas automatically qualify for the NIE and are thus eligible to travel to the U.S. for the upcoming fall semester, the notice said. In a Chinese-language press release Tuesday, the State Department said the U.S. government recognizes the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has presented for universities and their students, and expects international students from many countries including China to return to domestic campuses this fall. Since the Trump administration announced restrictions on travelers from China in January of last year, many Chinese students enrolled at American universities have needed to travel to a stopover country not targeted by a U.S. travel ban and remain there for at least 14 days before proceeding on to America. Chinese students who haven’t been able to make these convoluted travel plans have instead relied on remote learning — which can be especially challenging in China, given the 12 to 15 hour time difference with the U.S. Karen Wu, sophomore majoring in economics at the University of Wisconsin, told Sixth Tone that online courses have made her feel estranged from her classmates and professors, and have eroded her enthusiasm for learning. Though students in a similar situation to Wu will likely book travel directly to the U.S. following Monday’s announcement, she said she still plans to fly via Singapore, as she has already booked flights and nonrefundable accommodation in an approved quarantine hotel. Moreover, the price of direct flights from China to the U.S. “soared too high” after the State Department’s announcement, Wu said. “Since I will transfer through Singapore, I can also enjoy a couple days’ holiday there.” Yaqi Liu, a 24-year-old art administration grad student at Columbia University in New York, said she returned to China last September due to concerns about how rapidly the coronavirus was spreading in the U.S. At that time, she was hoping she would be able to travel back to the U.S. the following spring, but the lingering travel ban scuttled those plans — until now. “I feel so much relief with this new regulation,” she said. “We’ve waited a long time to hear this good news.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007347
First Chinese COVID-19 Vaccine Releases Clinical Trial Data,A preprint paper with detailed data from the CoronaVac trial in Brazil comes two months after the vaccine was granted conditional approval in China.,2021-04-13,"Health authorities in Brazil have released detailed results of a large-scale human trial for the CoronaVac vaccine, the first time complete trial data for a Chinese-developed COVID-19 shot has been shared with the public. In a non-peer-reviewed preprint paper published Monday, scientists from São Paulo’s Butantan Institute, two representatives from vaccine developer Sinovac, and researchers and doctors from more than a dozen participating institutions gave a demographic breakdown of the trial’s 12,000-plus participants, efficacy rates for preventing infections of varying degrees of severity, detailed explanations of adverse reactions, and a hypothesis for how CoronaVac’s efficacy might be improved. As was previously announced at a January press conference, CorvonaVac was found to be 50.7% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, 83.7% effective against “cases requiring assistance,” and 100% effective in preventing moderate or severe cases. Six trial participants who contracted severe COVID-19 were all in the placebo group. CoronaVac has the lowest reported efficacy rate of any coronavirus vaccine, though it still meets the World Health Organization’s approval threshold of 50%. By contrast, Beijing-based Sinopharm says its vaccine is around 79% effective, while the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines both have efficacy rates above 94%. Over the weekend, Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, acknowledged the relatively low efficacy rates of the country’s COVID-19 vaccines and said China would consider mixing them to boost efficacy rates. However, the Brazilian scientists appeared satisfied with CoronaVac’s trial performance. “Efficacy to prevent any symptomatic COVID-19 started at 50.7% and became more extensive as disease severity increased,” they wrote, adding that the Chinese vaccine was demonstrated to be “safe” and “well-tolerated.” A total of 12,396 people, all of them health care professionals, participated in the Brazil trial. They received two injections — either placebo or vaccine — at least two weeks apart. After the trial was expanded to include people aged 60 or above, these elderly accounted for 5.1% of the group, which had an average age of 39.5. There have been worries in China about whether the country’s vaccines are safe and effective for people aged 60 or above, or for women planning to have children. A previous small-scale trial among seniors had shown the shot to be safe for this population. But because of a lack of data on pregnant or lactating women, questions of safety and efficacy among these groups remained. The CoronaVac trial did not provide many answers. It included only 632 elderly participants, and pregnant or lactating women were ineligible due to ethical concerns. However, the Chinese government has since said that these groups can safely get vaccinated. The trial’s vaccine group reported more adverse reactions than the placebo group, mostly pain around the injection site. Headache and fatigue were reported similarly by both groups. There were no severe reactions related to the vaccine. “The observed safety and tolerability profiles were outstanding,” the authors wrote. Three participants died during the trial. Two people in the placebo group died of a heart attack and COVID-19, respectively, while one person in the vaccine group died from a medication overdose — a “serious adverse event” that was not related to the vaccine, the authors said. The trial was designed with an interval of two weeks between shots, but the authors found that delaying the second injection could potentially improve the vaccine’s efficacy. “Although there were a limited number of participants in this study having doses with an interval of 21 days or higher, there was a trend to higher efficacy,” they wrote, referring to the more than 700 vaccine group participants who followed this regimen. “Taken together, these data suggests (sic) that it is advisable to encourage longer intervals between doses, i.e., 28 days.” Since the trial’s completion, the Butantan Institute has delivered 38.2 million doses of CoronaVac to Brazilian health authorities. As of April 7, Sinovac had distributed a further 180 million doses to around 30 mostly low- and middle-income countries. In February, China’s drug regulator granted conditional approval to four domestically developed coronavirus vaccines including CoronaVac. The other three have not released data from their clinical trials.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007219
"Wuhan, Revisited","Returning to the Chinese city nearly one year after it emerged from lockdown, Sixth Tone finds life has superficially returned to normal. But residents’ emotional scars have yet to fade.",2021-04-07,"HUBEI, Central China — As I shuffled out of a packed Hankou Railway Station in downtown Wuhan on Saturday, it was hard to believe this was the same place I had visited just a year ago. Last April, I had traveled to the central Chinese city as it was preparing to lift a draconian lockdown that had lasted over 70 days. The streets were almost deserted and lined with tall yellow barriers, installed to prevent residents from leaving their homes. The only break in the eerie calm had come on April 4 — Tomb-Sweeping Day — when the city blared its air raid sirens to mourn the thousands of residents lost to COVID-19. Now, Wuhan was reassuringly chaotic once more. Families were taking advantage of the Tomb-Sweeping Day public holiday to travel, with the city’s train stations handling nearly 2.4 million passengers over the long weekend. The only visible signs of the pandemic were the large red banners hanging outside the station, which bore slogans reading “free COVID-19 vaccine site” and “get vaccinated as soon as possible.” Yet for locals like Li Jun, the traumatic memories of 2020 have yet to fade. When I first met Li, his wife — Guo Yin — was still stuck in the “red zone” — the part of Wuhan Union Hospital reserved for COVID-19 patients. She had fallen ill during the early days of the outbreak in January, when the disease was still referred to as a mysterious strain of pneumonia. After meeting me at a subway station across town, Li recounted his and Guo’s long recovery over the past year. This is their story, edited for brevity and clarity. (To protect the couple’s privacy, the names Li Jun and Guo Yin used in this article are pseudonyms.)   I was born in Wuhan in 1957. I joined the army when I was 17, and went on to serve in the air force for 21 years, eventually rising to become a deputy regimental commander in the northeastern city of Harbin. When I was 38 years old, I chose to go back to Wuhan to work for the local government. At that time, my wife, Guo Yin, was working in a state-owned steel plant in Wuhan. But in 1995, there was a wave of layoffs from state-owned enterprises, and she lost her job. After that, she started to do different jobs while also taking care of our family. Our daughter was born in 2000, and she now studies music theory at the Wuhan Conservatory of Music. As Spring Festival approached last year, Guo said she had a cold and didn’t feel well. At first, I didn’t pay much attention to her. I thought she’d just caught a cold due to all the cleaning she had been doing ahead of the holiday. I took her to see the doctor, but all the small clinics near our home were closed. So, we went to the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital instead. That was when we realized something strange was happening. I still remember how overcrowded the outpatient department on the first floor was that day. There must have been nearly 1,000 people lined up. Some people were crying and shouting. By the time we got home, my wife’s condition had worsened. Soon after, I saw the news about COVID-19 on TV. I was worried that my daughter might be at risk of infection in our home, so I sent her to stay with her aunt. I stayed to take care of my wife. We went to several different hospitals looking for help. But none of them had spare beds. Finally, we got lucky. On Jan. 24, which was the day before Lunar New Year and the day after Wuhan had been put into lockdown, she was admitted to Wuhan No. 6 Hospital. At that time, there was an extreme shortage of medical workers. The doctors and nurses had to work day and night without rest. So, I acted as a makeshift nurse, staying in the ward to care for my wife. There were four beds in the room originally, but the other two were moved out to keep us in isolation. At 8 a.m. each day, the doctor would come to attach a bottle of fluid to Guo’s IV. Throughout the day, she’d receive seven or eight bottles in total. I needed to look after her all the time. At night, I dared not sleep. She was on a ventilator. Twice, she accidentally removed her breathing tube in the middle of the night. Each time, her gasps for air jolted me awake, so I was able to get a doctor to reinsert it before she suffocated. After Guo was discharged, the doctor told me: “You deserve half the credit for your wife being alive.” But after staying in the ward for several days, I also became infected. I continued caring for Guo while receiving treatment. When I received fluid, I’d ask the doctor to put my IV on a quick setting, so I’d have more time to help my wife eat her meals. At that time, the hospital canteen was closed, and all the boxed lunches were donated by local residents. The food was cold and tasteless. The atmosphere in the hospital was so depressing. I didn’t have an appetite, but I still forced myself to eat a lot and drink plenty of water.  During those days, I’d constantly think about how I needed to care for my young daughter. I vowed that I’d help my wife get out of there. I never thought I would die in the hospital. On March 1, 2020, I was discharged and went back home. By this stage, my wife was also out of danger. On March 14, she was transferred to another hospital to continue her rehabilitation treatment. At the end of the month, she was transferred to Wuhan Union Hospital. Finally, on April 23, Guo was discharged from the hospital and transferred to a quarantine center for 14 days of observation. In May, she returned home. But once she was back home, Guo became worried about her physical recovery. I had seen the X-ray of her lungs when she was ill — they looked like frosted glass, with many white spots. To help her recover, I cooked lots of healthy food for her — lotus root, chicken, and “bird’s nest” soups. Last September, doctors of traditional Chinese medicine from the southern Guangdong province came back to visit Wuhan. My wife was selected to receive a full physical with them. The doctors said her recovery had progressed better than they had expected. We were overjoyed to hear that. When all of this is over, my wife and I hope to go traveling. My favorite place that I’ve visited is Greece. I still remember how blue the Aegean Sea waters were. Once the pandemic passes, I’ll take my family to visit some Southeast Asian countries.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007179
Chinese Border City Reports 112 Coronavirus Cases After Mass Testing,A citywide vaccination drive has been put on hold while Ruili conducts a second round of mass testing.,2021-04-06,"Update: Yunnan’s disciplinary authority announced on April 8 that Ruili’s party chief, Gong Yunzun, was removed from his post for “serious dereliction of duty” in preventing and controlling local COVID-19 outbreaks. Ruili, a city on China’s southwestern border with Myanmar, has reported over 100 coronavirus infections since last week, with three local areas designated “high-risk” on Monday. The cases mark the country’s first major COVID-19 flare-up since an outbreak in northern China over a month ago. Health authorities in Yunnan province, where Ruili is located, reported Tuesday that five more people in the city had tested positive for the coronavirus the previous day, bringing the province’s total case count to 112 after citywide testing began last Wednesday. A majority of these individuals showed symptoms, and almost all tested positive in or around Ruili. During a press conference Monday, local authorities said they would launch a second round of mass testing the following day. Because the boundary between Myanmar and Yunnan province is relatively porous, with people on both sides speaking the same languages and frequently intermingling, containing outbreaks in border communities can be especially challenging for local authorities. During previous outbreaks in China, people residing in high-risk areas have been asked to stay put to help contain the virus. For example, when the northern province of Hebei saw a surge in COVID-19 cases at the beginning of the year, local health authorities sealed off high-risk areas and ordered nonessential vehicles off the roads. Ruili reported its first coronavirus infection of the recent outbreak on March 29, detected during routine testing of “key groups” of people, which typically include medical personnel, customs officers, and cold chain food workers. Ruili had previously pledged to vaccinate all of its more than 300,000 residents in just five days, starting last Friday. But authorities said Monday that the inoculation campaign would be delayed until after the city’s second round of testing.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007162
"Pregnant Women Can Get Vaccinated for COVID-19, China Clarifies","Some informed consent documents had warned that women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant should not get inoculated.",2021-04-01,"China has issued an authoritative guideline stipulating for the first time which groups of people may get vaccinated for COVID-19, clearing the air after some clinics had advised pregnant women not to get inoculated. The guideline, published Monday by the National Health Commission, states that women aged 18 and above can get the coronavirus vaccine, regardless of their pregnancy status. There is no need to terminate or delay pregnancy because of the vaccine, it said. Sixth Tone found several unconfirmed informed consent documents circulating online suggesting that women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or hoping to become pregnant in the near future should avoid getting the coronavirus vaccine for the time being.    According to one informed consent document from Beijing’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is not recommended for those who are pregnant or lactating to get the vaccine. Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, told Sixth Tone there is no scientific basis for such a rule. As to why pregnant women could have been excluded, he said it was probably a precaution due to a lack of relevant data. “Because of ethical issues, pregnant women usually aren’t eligible to participate in clinical vaccine trials,” he explained. Women who are breastfeeding should be in the clear, too, Tao said. “The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are inactivated particles that don’t pose a threat to the infants’ health, even if they were to get into the breastmilk,” he said. The National Health Commission’s guideline also sets limits based on age, saying coronavirus vaccines may not be suitable for the very young. “The reason they aren’t recommended for people under 18 is because of insufficient clinical trial data for this group,” Tao said. “But actually, based on past experience, it’s likely the vaccines are both safe and effective for minors.” Another group mentioned in the new guideline is people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. These individuals may receive one dose of vaccine six months after recovering, when their antibody defenses are diminished. This is when they start to be at risk of reinfection, Tao said. As of Wednesday, some 119 million coronavirus vaccine doses had been administered in China, according to the National Health Commission.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007105
Chinese Border City on 1-Week Lockdown Over 9 Coronavirus Cases,"Several people in the southwestern city of Ruili, including four Myanmarese nationals, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday and Tuesday.",2021-03-31,"Update: Authorities in Yunnan will begin a mass vaccination campaign targeting four border cities including Ruili on April 1. A city located along China’s southwestern border with Myanmar has instituted a one-week quarantine and compulsory COVID-19 screening of its 200,000-plus residents after eight people tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. The previous day, Ruili, a county-level city in Yunnan province, had recorded one positive result from routine testing of “key groups” of people at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Typically, such groups have included cold chain workers, entry and exit bureau officials, wet market vendors, medical personnel, and public transport staff, among others. By screening the close contacts of the first positive case and conducting more tests among the key groups, city officials discovered another eight positive cases Tuesday. Of the nine total positive cases, three were asymptomatic carriers from Myanmar, while the remaining six — five Chinese, one Myanmarese — showed signs of COVID-19. Following the new cases, Ruili launched a citywide testing campaign Wednesday. Residents were asked to stay at home for one week, and all local businesses except markets and pharmacies have been ordered to temporarily close. The city’s COVID-19 prevention and control headquarters also warned that anyone facilitating illegal border crossings or sheltering illegal immigrants would be severely punished. Along Ruili’s southern border snakes a river of the same name, separating China from neighboring Myanmar. People on both sides speak the same language and frequently intermingle, which poses a formidable challenge to outbreak control efforts. Apart from a few sporadic clusters, China has been largely successful in controlling the coronavirus — so much so, in fact, that many people in the country don’t see an urgent need to get vaccinated. But authorities have warned that this mentality must change if the country is going to reopen its borders anytime soon. More than 110 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been administered in China as of Tuesday, according to the country’s top health authority. At the nationwide vaccination campaign’s current pace, herd immunity is still many months away. Also on Tuesday, the World Health Organization released its report on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, which concluded that an intermediate host was the most likely infection route to humans. While the report further said that a lab origin theory was “extremely unlikely,” the WHO’s director, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said during prepared remarks that “this requires further investigation.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007106
"In Beijing, COVID-19 Shots Come With Free Grocery Vouchers","As China accelerates its COVID-19 inoculation campaign, local authorities are trying to entice the vaccine-shy with special discounts.",2021-03-24,"A district in Beijing has become the first place in China to offer monetary incentives to residents who get COVID-19 shots, as authorities attempt to accelerate the country’s vaccination campaign. The inoculation office in Beijing’s Daxing District is working with local grocery stores to make 200 million yuan ($30.7 million) worth of “consumption coupons” available to people who complete their injection course, The Beijing News reported Wednesday. The move comes amid a wider push to speed up local inoculation drives. Last week, the Beijing municipal government ordered district officials to develop measures to encourage vaccine uptake among the public. So far, 73% of adult residents in Daxing have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to The Beijing News’ report. Most Chinese vaccines follow a two-dose regimen. Five grocery store chains are reportedly involved in the scheme, which is said to begin Wednesday. However, the businesses appear to have different plans for handing out the consumption coupons. One chain, Yonghui Superstores, is distributing discounts worth up to 150 yuan to each vaccinated resident, with customers able to claim 30 yuan off every purchase of 100 yuan, according to The Beijing News. But a worker at Wumart, another chain reportedly participating in the campaign, told Sixth Tone they hadn’t heard about such coupons from the company. A customer service representative at a Daxing store owned by Jiajiajili, a third company, told Sixth Tone customers can claim 20 yuan in coupons every day until May 31 by showing their vaccination certificates. China has approved four COVID-19 vaccines for use among the general public, but the country’s vaccination coverage has lagged. Last weekend, local governments issued a flurry of announcements pledging to make the shots available to more people. Previously, China had mainly focused on inoculating those at greater risk of infection, such as health care workers and customs officers. As of Tuesday, China had administered 82 million doses of COVID-19 shots, according to the National Health Commission (NHC), the country’s top public health authority. Chinese authorities also plan to integrate residents’ vaccination status into the country’s health codes, the digital health-tracking programs people use to enter public spaces including train stations and restaurants, Mao Qun’an, director of the NHC’s department of planning, said Tuesday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007048
"Vaccinations Only Way Out of Pandemic, China Tells Reluctant Public",Officials say getting inoculated needs to be a priority even for people who don’t feel they’re at risk of catching the coronavirus.,2021-03-22,"With a flurry of announcements over the weekend, Chinese authorities affirmed the government’s determination to press on with a national vaccination drive, assuring the public that getting inoculated against COVID-19 is both safe and necessary, despite there being no current outbreaks in the country. “The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and people should not think only of themselves,” He Qinghua, an official with the National Health Commission, China’s top public health agency, said during a press conference Sunday. “Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing and controlling COVID-19, so it is hoped that everyone will be proactive in getting inoculated.” While no official data is available, a January survey from French market research company Ipsos, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, found that less than half of Chinese people planned to get vaccinated against the coronavirus at their earliest opportunity. During a municipal government meeting last week, Beijing officials asked district authorities to make vaccination their “No. 1 task” and develop plans for encouraging vaccine uptake by the public. Concurrently over the weekend, several provincial and city governments announced their own vaccine coverage goals. Authorities in Guangzhou said they planned to inoculate all 11 million of the southern city’s residents aged 18 to 59 in the first half of this year. Meanwhile, the central Hunan province pledged to vaccinate vulnerable groups, including seniors and people with preexisting health conditions, by the end of the year. In addition to the Chinese public’s general reluctance to get vaccinated immediately, the country’s inoculation rate is also low because of its large population. As of Sunday, China had administered nearly 75 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, most of which call for a two-shot course. That number is far from what’s needed to reach herd immunity, which would require upward of 1 billion people vaccinated to curb the future spread of the coronavirus. Many experts including Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease specialist heading up Shanghai’s coronavirus response, have expressed concerns about the country’s slow vaccine rollout. “If China’s inoculation drive isn’t fast enough, then we should expect an increase in infection rates among our population,” he said during a presentation Saturday. The coronavirus is likely to coexist with humans similar to the way influenza does, Gao Fu, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a forum Saturday. “Humans need to be prepared,” he said. “The relationship between us and the virus is a cat-and-mouse game,” like Tom and Jerry.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007027
China Faces Long March to Herd Immunity,"The country’s massive population, moderately effective vaccines, and success in controlling outbreaks all strain its national inoculation drive.",2021-03-18,"In March 2020, two weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, China closed its borders to noncitizens. Business exchanges ground to a halt, international flights dwindled, and Chinese people living abroad struggled to return home. Now nearly a year later, with many of China’s travel restrictions still in place, the availability of vaccines presents a light at the end of the tunnel. Once a large enough part of a population becomes immune, the coronavirus should no longer cause large outbreaks, a situation called herd immunity. “If a lot of people are immunized, then every time the virus tries to spread from one person to another, there will be a wall that stops it,” Xie Youhua, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone.  But China faces many hurdles before it can reach herd immunity, experts tell Sixth Tone, meaning the country may be looking at a lengthy path out of isolation. They point to China’s inoculation drive having been slow to ramp up to the speeds needed to match its massive population; the fact that the country’s success in controlling outbreaks means, according to official figures, only about 85,000 of its citizens built up immunity after recovering from COVID-19; and its vaccines’ relatively lower efficacy rates, which may be further compromised by new mutations of the virus. Scientists estimate that somewhere between 60% and 90% of a population will need to be immunized to reach herd immunity against COVID-19. In China, that means a minimum of 840 million people. Already a staggering number, the figure rises considerably when factoring in vaccine effectiveness. Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist and disease modeler at Hong Kong University, told Sixth Tone that the immunity level of a population can be calculated by multiplying the vaccine’s effectiveness by the proportion of people receiving the shot. For example, if 70% of the population receives a 95% effective vaccine, like those developed by U.S.-based Moderna and Germany’s BioNTech, then the population reaches an immunity level of 66%, above the lowest estimated threshold for herd immunity. Chinese authorities have approved four vaccines, all made domestically, for use by the general public. Their efficacies range from 50% to 79%, according to their manufacturers. Even if the country only used its strongest vaccine, 76% of the population — or more than 1 billion people — would need to be inoculated to reach herd immunity. Because the country is also using less effective vaccines, the actual number will be higher still.  As of Monday, China had administered nearly 65 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines, most of which require two doses per person. Zhong Nanshan, China’s top health advisor, said during an interview earlier this month that the country is planning to inoculate 40% of its population — about 560 million people — by June. That goal is extremely ambitious given the current pace of the country’s vaccine rollout, Huang Yanzhong, an expert on public health in China at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, told Sixth Tone. “It will be fairly long until China reaches herd immunity.”  China’s vaccine manufacturers are still ramping up production. An executive at Sinopharm, maker of two COVID-19 vaccines approved in China, said the company could make over 1 billion doses in 2021 to fulfill domestic demand. Sinovac, another vaccine maker, is also reported by state-backed media to be increasing its output to 2 billion doses annually by June. But new mutations of the coronavirus identified in several countries around the world threaten the vaccines’ effectiveness. Preliminary data has shown that some variants could lower the efficacies of several Western vaccines, with some products even dropping below the World Health Organization’s approval threshold of 50% efficacy. Moderna said it plans to tweak its COVID-19 shot in an attempt to boost protection levels in populations. Experts are also worried about the Chinese public’s willingness to get inoculated. “We (China) rarely have local cases, mostly ones imported from abroad. So ordinary people may not feel an urgent need to get the vaccine,” said Xie of Fudan University. According to a January survey conducted in partnership with the World Economic Forum, about 85% of Chinese are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but less than half said they would get it as soon as vaccines become available. This represents a drop from last summer, when 95% of Chinese surveyed said they were willing to get vaccinated.  As for reaching herd immunity, a lower willingness to get vaccinated won’t matter at first, said Cowling. “It matters when you finish the 1 billionth person, because at that point is when you can go back to normal.” He expects many of the current public health measures and policies, such as quarantines and travel bans, to remain in place for another year or two. Cowling suggested that, if the Chinese government wanted to encourage people to get inoculated, it could incorporate an individual’s vaccination status into the country’s health code system — an assortment of health-tracking apps that people use to get into restaurants, train stations, and other venues— and only give green codes to inoculated people. A “vaccine passport” has also been under discussion recently to facilitate international travel, although the World Health Organization has yet to endorse the idea. China could also opt to loosen restrictions even before herd immunity is reached. Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona, said China’s vaccines, though relatively less effective at preventing COVID-19 outright, are “still very effective in preventing severe infections and death.”  Both Sinovac and Sinopharm, China’s two main COVID-19 vaccine makers, say their vaccines can prevent 100% of severe symptoms. “If you can stop people from going into the ICUs and not taking up the already-limited medical resources in China, that’s what matters,” Wang told Sixth Tone. In most parts of the world, the death rate of COVID-19 has been dropping. Scientists mostly agree that the COVID-19 pandemic will start acting like the flu in at least the next couple of years, with low mortality, seasonal spikes, and yearly mutations. A COVID-19 vaccine will then become a recurring inoculation, like the flu shot. What needs to be reconsidered, experts argue, is how governments and the public respond to local cases. China has been adhering to a “zero-tolerance policy” for COVID-19 cases. In the past year, authorities have been applying all-out measures to limit the spread of the virus, including citywide lockdowns and mass testing. Wang said that once COVID-19’s mortality rate drops to a level comparable to that of the flu — because of built-up immunity or less deadly mutants — there will no longer be a need to treat the coronavirus like a “number one enemy.”  “The ‘by all means, at all cost’ approach China has right now is not sustainable,” said Huang, the China health policy expert. With more and more people becoming vaccinated, China should focus on an “exit strategy” from the current policy, he added. Part of the plan would rely on educating the public so they become less afraid to coexist with the virus. “Once you’ve reached a high level of population immunity, then there’s no need to be drastic anymore, because (the outbreak) is not going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. It’s going to naturally end, like the flu does,” Cowling said. So far, however, there are few signs that the Chinese government is considering such scenarios. Gao Fu, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a recent interview with state media that the country aims to vaccinate 70% to 80% of its population by the middle of next year. “On a global scale, we hope China can be a leader in achieving herd immunity,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006956
"When My Hometown Went Into Lockdown, It Changed Me","A documentary student captures her experience in Tonghua, when the small city was hit by COVID-19 and became national news for its residents running out of food.",2021-03-16,"In January, the coronavirus came for my city. I was in Shanghai planning to head back and see my family for Lunar New Year when 12 cases were reported in my hometown, Tonghua, which sits on the North Korean border in northeastern China’s Jilin province. After citywide testing, that number approached 300. Shanghai, at the time, was coronavirus-free and thus designated a low-risk area, allowing me to travel to Tonghua. But on the phone, I sensed my parents were hesitant about me coming home. They probably had a better understanding of what was going on than most, as they both work in the government and had been deployed as frontline workers, each assigned to a neighborhood to help with testing and enforcing stay-at-home orders.  But I’d spent the last few years studying abroad, and hadn’t had an opportunity to be home for Spring Festival. I desperately wanted to welcome the Year of the Ox with my family. And so, on Jan. 21, I arrived in Tonghua and moved in to an empty apartment. Until I received a negative test result, I had to quarantine.  Around midnight, my mom made a surprise visit. She brought me almost all the microwaveable food from her fridge, leaving it by my door and absconding without explanation. I later learned that on that night, all government workers, including both of my parents, were tasked with an “emergency duty”: to put a seal on all storefronts, public buildings, and every home. Tonghua was going into lockdown, and no one was going to be allowed outside. By that time, the city was already four days into a stay-at-home order, during which people were still allowed to go outside but couldn’t leave their gated communities. Most households had already run out of fresh food, and now their doors had been taped shut. In a way, this was all the more reason for the Tonghua government to enforce a stricter lockdown without prior notice. Surely, lots of people would have otherwise gone for last-minute panic shopping, increasing the risk of infections. To the people in charge of Tonghua, the pandemic is the biggest event of their careers. At a loss for what to do, they understandably chose a safe route: They were willing to go to any lengths to stop the number of cases from increasing, even if that meant putting people’s lives on pause. My mom told me the night she and her colleagues were sealing people’s homes, she heard a dog barking behind a locked door. She knew that without food or water, the odds of the animal surviving the lockdown would be low. As much as I tried to convince her there was nothing she could have done to save the dog, she is haunted by the incident to this day.  I’ve always struggled to explain to people where I’m from, as Tonghua doesn’t have quite the same name recognition as Beijing or Shanghai. But on the fifth day of the lockdown, as my ramen supplies dwindled, everyone suddenly seemed to know about my hometown. My phone was buzzing with notifications from my friends asking if I was OK. “You’re from this place in the Northeast, right?” one friend asked. I soon realized that “Tonghua COVID-19” had been trending on microblogging site Weibo. Scrolling through the site, I saw mothers running out of baby formula and diabetics splitting their daily insulin doses into seven parts. Although I was physically at the center of this epidemic, I was separated from the rest of Tonghua by the four walls around me. I could only see a vacant street outside my window. The city seemed completely silent, and I’m not connected with most of my Tonghua relatives on social media. It shook me how I had to learn what was happening to the people around me from a public Weibo page. Maybe it was the quarantine anxiety kicking in, but I suddenly had to confront the fact that I had been dissociating — both physically and emotionally — from my hometown for years. To my relatives in Tonghua, I was brainwashed by “capitalist values” and was “too ambitious for a girl.” No one understood why my parents, sacrificing a potentially well-off lifestyle, chose to empty their bank accounts and take out loans for me to pursue my dream as a documentary film student in New York City. And when I came home for visits, I would always bring back questions that were either “too sensitive” or “not appropriate” for family gatherings. My Tonghua childhood friends and I had grown more distant after every instance of me getting upset over their racist or misogynistic comments. And so, during my holiday visits to Tonghua, I seldom left the house. But when a disaster like this hit, the ideological differences that I’d been holding against Tonghua suddenly seemed minor — if not entirely pointless.  Venturing Out In China’s major cities, food-delivery apps employ a small army of drivers who can transport your take-out anywhere. However, in smaller Tonghua, the sudden demand from 300,000 people needing their daily necessities overwhelmed them. So, starting on Jan. 23, the Tonghua Youth Volunteers Association began recruiting volunteers to work alongside government workers to help distribute free “grocery packages” to every household. As a young person with no preexisting conditions, I felt I had to go out and help. I signed up to be a volunteer knowing that even if I got infected, I wouldn’t regret my decision.  On Jan. 27, I stepped outside for the first time, a volunteer pass in hand. Although I had expected to witness doom and gloom, what I saw was a lot harder to take in. The otherwise emptied-out streets made way for one ambulance after another, their sirens splitting the air. From afar, police cars could be heard playing public service announcements: “...in accordance with the anti-coronavirus regulations, anyone who is outside without permission will be arrested...” The snowflakes kept fluttering down, blurring my vision and creating a dark but dreamlike atmosphere. For a moment it all felt like a cruel nightmare, which, I worried, this impoverished northeastern city would struggle to wake up from. Because I had no vehicle, I was assigned to unload trucks and make sure the thousands of boxes with protective gear — some of which donated from around the country — were divided up between some 3,000 volunteers in the city. I had 11 colleagues: The youngest was a college freshman, the oldest twice his age. Among us, there was a farmer, a hardware store owner, tutoring center owners, and even a skiing coach.  One of them was a close family friend. Although he never spoke about it, I had heard about his grandmother being hospitalized due to COVID-19. One night, we heard rumors of a positive case found among the volunteers, which put us at risk of quarantine. “Everyone, if we end up having to quarantine, make sure that you wear protective gear when you’re being transferred to a quarantine center,” he said, breaking the anxious silence between us. “My grandmother was infected when she was being transported to a quarantine center by others who’d been in close contact with infected people,” he said, his voice quivering a little at the end of his sentence. I understood why he didn’t want to speak about his grandmother, because the matter was too emotional for him to deal with when he needed to face a fight of his own. Because we worked directly with volunteers from all around the city, we were at high risk of infection. I was privileged to have an apartment to myself, unlike some of our team members. The hardware store owner had sent his wife and son away to protect them from being infected. He is your typical “northeastern man,” who talks with a low voice, went to juvenile detention centers for picking fights in school, and has a giant tattoo. But every time we were on a break, he’d video-call his wife. One time, when his wife was dealing with appendicitis, he just started crying the second he hung up. “This is the longest that we’ve been away from each other,” he told me, “I miss her like crazy.” After he composed himself, he told me to delete the picture I had taken. “Don’t take photos when I’m crying,” he said.  At first, I didn’t understand why thousands of volunteers had come out risking their lives. My teammates all gave the same answer: “I wanted to do my part for the city of Tonghua.” One teammate said that, for someone who will never leave Tonghua, this outbreak might be the biggest event that’ll ever happen to him. Being part of the volunteer effort gave him a sense of purpose. But if he was following the collectivist doctrine of “contributing to the greater good,” what were my motives?  Growing up, I had always been on my own, individual path: I was the one who went away for boarding school, and who didn’t take the national college-entrance exams. I had forgotten the joys of being part of a collective. I’ve lost count of the times my teammates took off their winter coats and gloves for me to put on while it snowed and was minus 30 degrees Celsius outside. In a matter of days, we 12 strangers built a strange but magical rapport because we all had only one goal: to ensure that every person who risked their lives on the front lines would be protected. While sitting on boxes of N95 masks and sweating under our protective suits, I chatted with my teammates and learned their life stories were drastically different from mine and the protective bubble that my parents had built around me. I began to understand why they are the way they are and why it’s hard for them to accept the liberal ideologies that I had absorbed from my surroundings. Although I’m a steadfast feminist who despises the sexism and machismo of northeastern culture, the volunteering experience taught me not to fixate on our differences but focus on our commonalities.  A week before Lunar New Year, we decided to become sworn brothers and sisters. Someone proposed that the 12 of us should each take one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac as our nicknames. Being the second-youngest, I became the dog, the second-to-last sign. In the Northeast, to become someone’s sworn brother or sister, you first have to go through a life-or-death experience with the person. After what we’ve been through, that is something I can confidently say we did. But above all, I now have a community to come back to the next time I return to Tonghua. New Year’s Eve When I was little, the months before and after Spring Festival used to be the liveliest times in Tonghua. Migrant workers and college students would come back, filling up the otherwise somewhat empty city. Street vendors selling couplets, firecrackers, and popsicles would pop up on every corner of every street. At home, I remember the sound of relatives playing mahjong and the smell of fresh tangerines, one of the few fruits in season during the harsh northeastern winter. As the days crept closer to this year’s Lunar New Year’s Eve, the liveliness was nowhere to be seen. Even though the government now allowed one person from every household to go out for an hour once every two days, cars were still rare. With public transportation also suspended, people were mostly scurrying along, their faces covered with several masks and sometimes even swimming goggles, their arms weighed down by huge bags of groceries. The only other people about were sanitation workers, who never stopped working. Even during the lockdown, snowy conditions still meant they’d have to get up at 4 a.m. to clear the streets.  Two days before Spring Festival, my father, who had been deployed to the front lines at another district, called and said he heard he might be able to come back for New Year’s Eve — a sign that a ban on cross-district traffic might soon be lifted. Throughout the outbreak, the city government imposed and canceled restrictions on travel based on considerations they did not make public, meaning that, if you’re not “connected,” all you could do was wait at home before being told when you could move about freely again.  Among the volunteers, a few people decided to stay on duty on New Year’s Eve so the rest of us could go home to our families. My request to stay was denied. As such, although it had seemed impossible even a week ago, I was going to have the New Year’s Eve family reunion that I’d longed for. After my last COVID-19 test came back negative, I finally returned home. From Jan. 21, the day I arrived in Tonghua, to Feb. 11, New Year’s Eve, my journey home took three weeks. I was finally going to see my grandmother, who had lived with us since I was born. She had not stepped out of our home for two months. When I finally met her, I was unsure of which to do first: share my volunteering stories, or hear about her quarantine stories. My grandma, who lived through the Korean War when she was young, told me that when our door was taped shut and all she could hear all day were police cars patrolling the empty streets and playing announcements into the night, it reminded her of her childhood. Then, too, there was a constant tension of disaster being just moments away.  Tonghua sits along the border between China and the Korean Peninsula, and is therefore home to many ethnic Koreans. My grandmother found out later that her Korean friends had shared her feeling of impending doom, of “not knowing what food you’ll have on the table tomorrow” while “worrying about your family’s safety.” I wonder how long my experience during the pandemic will impact my lifetime. This time last year, Wuhan was going through the chaos of its early COVID-19 outbreak. Fast-forward to March, and the same was happening in the United States, where former President Trump went on television to discourage mask-wearing. I was forced to pause school and come back to China while the virus raged in the States. When I thought that the pandemic had finally run its course, and that things were coming back to normal, my hometown was on the national news asking for aid and support. On the night of New Year’s Eve, my dad replaced the seal on our door with the Spring Festival couplets he had bought before the lockdown. We took some meat and some leftover dough from our refrigerator, which was fortunately just enough for four servings of dumplings. The four of us sat in front of the TV, each with our masks on and social distancing, and watched the Spring Festival Gala. On TV, people with happy faces were celebrating the provisional victory in the fight against the coronavirus. We sat and watched, but barely spoke a word. Pan Yi is a pen name. 27, 2021.

China Aims to Reopen Borders Using Digital Health Certificates,"China’s foreign minister says the country is working on an international system to recognize travelers’ COVID-19 test and vaccine histories, but details remain murky.",2021-03-08,"China is working to create a digital health certificate system to facilitate global travel amid the coronavirus pandemic, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday, sparking renewed discussion over when and to what extent the country may relax international travel restrictions. Speaking at a virtual press conference during the 13th National People’s Congress, Wang said the digital health certificate program would enable countries to mutually verify travelers’ nucleic acid test results and vaccine histories, allowing “a healthy, safe, and regulated new order for cross-border exchanges of people.” Wang said the Chinese government is engaging with international partners on the program but did not reveal which countries are involved, what stage of development the program has reached, or when it may finally be rolled out. The digital health certificates would be implemented while “fully protecting personal privacy,” the foreign minister added, without specifying how this would be achieved. Wang’s comments come amid heightened debate both in China and abroad over whether countries should begin to relax travel restrictions as mass COVID-19 inoculation campaigns make headway. Zhu Zhengfu, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body, has suggested China could make it easier for overseas travelers to enter. International arrivals could be exempted from compulsory 14-day quarantine measures if they carry both a negative nucleic acid test result and a vaccine passport, Zhu recently told domestic media. Those in China with a vaccine passport, meanwhile, would be allowed to travel domestically without having to take a nucleic acid test, he added. China currently imposes strict conditions on those wishing to enter the country. Travelers are required to obtain a negative nucleic acid test result within 72 hours of travel. Once in China, they must then undergo 14 days of quarantine, as well as a “health observation” period of up to seven days, depending on local policies.  China’s foreign ministry first revealed it was working on a system for countries to mutually recognize travelers’ health information last November. At the time, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the system was in an early stage, and future discussions would focus on building international cooperation and ensuring the protection of private data. Any relaxation in travel restrictions, however, will depend on China’s progress in its COVID-19 inoculation program. Last week, Zhong Nanshan, head of a top advisory group under the National Health Commission, said the country aims to vaccinate 40% of its 1.4 billion people by the end of June. Other countries’ inoculation rates vary widely: Israel has fully vaccinated 42.9% of its population, while the United States has completed 8.9% and Germany just 2.9%. The Chinese plan for a digital health certificate resembles strategies floated by other organizations to facilitate global travel by creating vaccine passports. Earlier this month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced draft legislation to establish a Digital Green Pass, which will contain European citizens’ COVID-19 test histories, to be put forward by March 17. South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand are also currently discussing the implementation of a vaccine passport system.  But the programs are controversial, with the World Health Organization advising in February that vaccine passports should not be used to simplify cross-border entry restrictions for the time being. So far, there isn’t sufficient scientific data proving that vaccines are effective in alleviating the spread of the coronavirus, according to the WHO. Experts have also raised concerns about potential privacy risks associated with vaccine passports. Health officials from several countries are still working with the WHO to develop international rules and standards for the programs. Tao Lina, a vaccine expert based in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone that China should actively participate in efforts to develop these systems but should remain cautious about relaxing travel restrictions. “It’s important to note that China is now a non-epidemic region,” Tao said. “We shouldn’t loosen epidemic control measures too drastically. … It’s not yet proven that vaccines can effectively prevent asymptomatic infections.” At the virtual press conference, Foreign Minister Wang also said China is working on a “Spring Seedling Action” program to help Chinese nationals abroad receive COVID-19 vaccines. The program will include both domestically made and foreign-developed vaccines, he added. More than 100,000 volunteers from at least 100 countries are participating in international clinical trials of China’s COVID-19 vaccines, and over 60 countries have approved use of these vaccines, according to Wang.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006928
Chinese Scientists Identify 44 Animals Susceptible to COVID-19,"The at-risk species include livestock, zoo animals, and common pets.",2021-03-05,"Giant pandas and rhinos have joined the ranks of animals that may be able to contract COVID-19. In a peer-reviewed paper published Thursday in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing, Fudan University in Shanghai, and Westlake University in Hangzhou identified an expanded list of animals — at least 44 species — that could be susceptible to the coronavirus. After screening nearly 300 animal species including birds, reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and fish, they identified 80 — all mammals — with several protein elements important to viral binding and entry during human infection. Ding Qiang, a virologist at Tsinghua University who led the study, told Sixth Tone that it’s unclear why only mammals possessed the type of protein that allowed the coronavirus to latch on. “But our research shows that some previous hypotheses, like salmon contracting the virus, are incorrect,” he said. Of the 80 potential hosts, the team chose 48 species that are endangered or often in close contact with humans for further research. They found that 44 animals, including gibbons, rabbits, pigs, giant pandas, and rhinos, could become infected with the coronavirus.  A key finding, the researchers said, was that being genetically closer to humans didn’t seem to make species more likely to contract COVID-19. While animals like cats are highly susceptible to infections, New World monkeys — a group of primates native to the Americas that includes marmosets and squirrel monkeys — have small genetic mutations on the key protein that stop the virus from entering their cells. “We don’t know what kind of pressure they underwent during evolution to result in these changes,” Ding told Sixth Tone. “I’m not an expert on evolution, but I’m amazed.” In the last two decades, there have been three major coronavirus outbreaks. For SARS and MERS, palm civets and camels are generally accepted as the intermediate hosts — the animals that passed the respective viruses to humans. While many scientists suspect that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, the intermediate host or hosts are still unknown, which is a source of great concern to those seeking to stop such viruses from spreading to humans again in the future. “Based on the result of this study, if we want to completely wipe out the virus, we need to consider the possibility of transmission between animals and humans,” Ding said. With SARS-CoV-2 now appearing to affect more animals than previously thought, the researchers stressed the importance of cracking down on the trade and consumption of illegal wildlife, as well as surveilling animals that come into close contact with humans.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006925
"China Aims to Accelerate Vaccination, Reach 40% Immunity by June",Top health experts say they’re concerned about the country’s current inoculation rate against COVID-19.,2021-03-03,"China wants to vaccinate 40% of its population by the end of June, an ambitious target given the country’s current vaccination rate of just 3.56%. During a recent online event hosted by Tsinghua University and the Brookings Institution, Zhong Nanshan, the head of the National Health Commission’s top advisory group, said the country plans to ramp up its national vaccination campaign, citing sources at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “The longer vaccination takes, the more likely there will be more mutant strains,” Zhong said, according to domestic media reports Wednesday. The renowned pulmonologist added that China must seek to achieve herd immunity through vaccination because it can’t afford to keep its border closed forever. “Time is tight. We still have a lot to do,” Zhong said. As of the end of February, Chinese health authorities had administered over 52 million doses of vaccine. The vast majority of coronavirus vaccines currently on the market require two doses, usually weeks apart, for maximum protection. The World Health Organization has advised countries to reach herd immunity against COVID-19 through vaccination to greatly lower transmission capacity. Herd immunity thresholds vary for different infectious diseases. While the target for the coronavirus has yet to be determined, experts have suggested it’s likely 70% or higher. China has granted conditional approval to several domestically developed vaccines since June of last year, even though none have been fully tested. According to Zhong, six out of 60 Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates have entered phase 3 clinical trials. As of late February, Beijing led all provincial-level regions with 5.56 million doses administered. Other high-profile health experts who participated in the online event echoed Zhong’s comments. Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease specialist heading up Shanghai’s coronavirus response, said the immunity gap is “of great concern” — and even if China reaches 40% vaccination coverage by June, that’s still too low. According to Zhang, assuming 10 million doses of vaccine are administered daily, it will take seven months for China to vaccinate 70% of its 1.4 billion people and reach the presumed herd immunity threshold. Globally, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is extremely uneven, as developing nations with limited health care infrastructure are lagging far behind wealthier countries. Israel leads the world with a vaccination rate of nearly 95%. Ranking next are the United Arab Emirates (61%), the United Kingdom (31%), and the United States (23%). At the current pace of vaccination, Zhong expects global herd immunity to take at least two or three years. According to domestic media, Zhang, the Shanghai-based epidemiologist, called for cooperation toward the global vaccination effort, especially with respect to aiding developing countries. Otherwise, he said, herd immunity might not last once it’s reached. “In this regard, we must transcend political constraints and cooperate,” Zhang said. This story was updated on March 3 to clarify the suspected herd immunity threshold for COVID-19.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006921
China Approves Two New COVID-19 Vaccines,"The country has so far greenlighted four shots, all from domestic manufacturers.",2021-02-26,"China’s drug regulator granted conditional approval for two coronavirus vaccines Thursday, a day after their manufacturers announced efficacy data from large-scale clinical trials. One of the vaccines is from state-owned Sinopharm’s research institute based in the central city of Wuhan. The company said it is 72.51% effective in preventing COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In December, a COVID-19 vaccine from Sinopharm’s Beijing laboratory was granted approval for use by the general public. Dubbed BBIBP-CorV, the shot is said to be 79.34% effective and was the first COVID-19 vaccine approved in China. Sinopharm has been conducting large-scale human trials for the two vaccines in foreign countries including the United Arab Emirates and Peru. The second vaccine approved Thursday was jointly developed by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics and the People’s Liberation Army. According to CanSino, the vaccine — dubbed Convidecia — is shown to be 68.83% effective in preventing COVID-19 two weeks after inoculation and 65.28% effective after four weeks. The reason for the discrepancy in efficacy remains unclear, but the company said the outcomes were based on preliminary data. Neither Sinopharm nor CanSino has released detailed data from the clinical trials. As of Friday, China has greenlighted four COVID-19 vaccines for use by the general public, all under conditional approval. Vaccine manufacturers can apply for final approval from authorities after they submit complete data from their trials. While three of the vaccines, including two from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac, require a two-dose regimen, Convidecia is just a single injection — an advantage that’s likely to speed up China’s mass vaccination campaign. As of Feb. 9, China had administered over 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006895
China’s Viral Holiday Face Masks Raise Health Concerns,"Novelty face masks are all the rage in China this Lunar New Year holiday, but experts warn the coverings could pose a public health risk.",2021-02-16,"SHANGHAI — While watching the Spring Festival Gala — China’s Lunar New Year TV variety show — last Thursday, Yang Xiaohui was captivated by one detail in particular: the colorful face masks worn by the studio audience. “I was so tired of the plain blue masks I’ve been wearing for a year, so I ordered 100 of those masks with the ox pattern right away,” the 27-year-old Shanghai resident told Sixth Tone. The Gala’s festive red and blue coverings — each decorated with a pair of oxen surrounded by clouds, symbolizing good fortune in the Year of the Ox — unexpectedly became the star of the show, which was watched by an estimated 1.14 billion people on Lunar New Year’s Eve. The program has fueled a nationwide fashion for brightly colored novelty masks this Lunar New Year holiday. On Chinese e-commerce platforms, stores offering “Spring Festival Gala” masks have sold tens of thousands of items. Staff at several pharmacies in Shanghai told Sixth Tone customers were visiting expressly to inquire about where they could buy similar masks. But the trend is raising concerns among Chinese health professionals, who warn the viral face coverings often offer poor protection against COVID-19 and in some cases may even endanger the health of those wearing them.  Zhi Xiuyi, deputy head of the Beijing Health Education Assocation, said it was important for the relevant authorities to strictly supervise the quality of trendy new masks. “We wear masks to protect ourselves against the disease,” Zhi told local media Sunday. “Fashionable masks add to the atmosphere of the Spring Festival. But if they don’t guarantee health, then these masks are no better than ornaments.” The same day, SAIC-GM-Wuling — a major Chinese automaker — issued a statement confirming that the masks worn by audience members during the Spring Festival Gala were manufactured by one of its subsidiaries, but the coverings aren’t available for public sale. Any “Spring Festival Gala” masks sold online weren’t produced by the company, it stressed. On the e-commerce site Taobao, searches for “New Year masks” produce results for thousands of products. On promotional pages for the products, many merchants state the masks are “anti-virus” and “meet national standards.” Yet in the comments sections of several online stores, buyers had left complaints about masks being “not satisfactory” in quality and even becoming discolored. An Yadong, a doctor at Xi’an No. 1 Hospital, said many holiday masks were too brightly colored and might fade. “Some people who are allergic (to the pigments used in the masks) will develop a reaction if they wear them for a long time,” An told a local TV station in February. “In particular, some poor-quality dyes, if decolorized, may causes diseases is they pass into the digestive system or respiratory tract.”  A customer service representative for Hunan Cofoe Medical Products — one of the companies selling Lunar New Year masks on Taobao — insisted its products were made of the same material as regular powder-blue surgical masks in a message sent to Sixth Tone Tuesday. “The three layers of melt spray cloth can block droplets for pandemic protection and prevent blood and bodily fluids from passing through the mask to infect the wearer,” the person wrote. It remains to be seen whether the fashion for colorful face coverings continues after the national holiday comes to an end on Wednesday. Wang Ting, a 30-year-old from Shanghai, said she had purchased 100 red masks before the festival, giving away many of them to relatives as Lunar New Year gifts. But she admitted she wasn’t confident about their quality, and would only wear them for the holiday celebrations. “Masks have become necessities of life, and it’s festive to wear red ones on holidays,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006849
China Confirms First Local COVID-19 Infection of Lunar New Year,"The case was uncovered in the northern city of Shijiazhuang, which previously went into lockdown in January due to a surge in infections.",2021-02-15,"China has reported its first local COVID-19 infection since the start of the Lunar New Year holiday. The case was uncovered in Shijiazhuang, capital of the northern Hebei province, officials announced Monday morning. It’s the first confirmed local infection in China since Feb. 8. Shijiazhuang is one of several northern Chinese cities that have been battling a resurgence of the coronavirus this winter. Located less than 300 kilometers from Beijing, the city previously went into lockdown in early January due to a spike in infections. The latest patient is from a village in Shijiazhuang’s Gaocheng District, who had previously returned several negative nucleic acid tests during home and centralized quarantine since Jan. 3, according to Hebei provincial authorities. On Saturday evening, however, the person came down with a fever and was transferred to Shijiazhuang No. 3 Hospital. On Sunday morning, the patient’s nucleic acid test results came back positive. The new infection brings the total number of local active COVID-19 cases in Hebei to 153, while nine asymptomatic patients are still under medical observation in the province. Chinese authorities have been concerned about the potential for an increase in COVID-19 cases over the Lunar New Year holiday, which began last Thursday, as millions of people travel across the country on vacation or to visit their hometowns. Many local governments have required returning migrants to obtain negative nucleic acid tests before traveling and self-isolate after their arrival. As of Sunday, a total of 89,772 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on the Chinese mainland since the pandemic began, while 4,636 people in the country have died from the disease, according to official figures.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006847
The Man Shepherding China’s Best Zoo Through Its Worst Year,"Balancing animals’ dignity and visitors’ entertainment was already a tall order, and then the pandemic hit.",2021-02-13,"This story is part of a weekend column featuring translations from respected Chinese media outlets, as selected and edited by Sixth Tone. All are reproduced with the outlets’ permission. A version of this article was first published in Guyu Lab. JIANGSU, East China — Last year during the pandemic, when Nanjing’s Hongshan Forest Zoo had to shut its doors, it often seemed to nevertheless have one guest: Shen Zhijun, the zoo’s director. He often wandered the grounds on his own, cutting a solitary figure with his head bowed. Shen is familiar with all the sounds here — such as the calls of parrots, cranes, and pheasants on Fangniu Hill. In the afternoon, the wolves congregate to howl first, followed by the tigers roaring a few hours later. Throughout, the gibbons sing. One of the zoo’s orangutans knows Shen well. On a recent December day, the giant ape was sitting motionless on his platform 1 meter off the ground, as he often does, basking in the sun. Standing on the other side of the glass wall, Shen called his name: “Xiao Hei! Xiao Hei!” The ape turned his head, revealing a pair of symmetrical black cheek pouches, the hallmark of male orangutans. After spotting Shen, he thought for a few seconds, then slowly clambered down from his perch, walked over to the glass, and quietly sat down opposite him. Staff often see this scene as they pass by: The two of them sit opposite one another like old friends. Sometimes, Shen will make small talk with Xiao Hei, asking “Are you cold?” Hongshan covers an area of 65 hectares next to the railway station of Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu, and is home to more than 2,800 animals. Shen goes by the name “King of the Animals” on messaging app WeChat, and refers to the zoo’s inhabitants — most of which he knows by name — as his “children.” As if Shen were a full-time caretaker, he is sensitive to the animals’ conditions. On one visit to the Elephant House, he watched for a while before pointing to one of the elephants and asking the keeper, “Hasn’t she been a little grumpy lately?” According to the zookeeper, this female elephant was going through estrus at the time. This is Shen’s 13th year as the zoo’s director. He is 49 years old, wears black-rimmed glasses, has gentle eyes and the air of an educated person, and doesn’t put much stock in appearances. Over the past decade or so, Hongshan has transformed from relative obscurity into one of China’s top zoos. In a sector where animals are still often housed in small and barren cages, Hongshan has transformed itself over the last decade with nature-like enclosures, something that was achieved in no small part due to Shen’s conviction. In the words of Li Meirong, a deputy director of the zoo, Shen is a very driven person with a strong fighting spirit: “No matter how much pressure there is, he doesn’t back down.” However, staff at the zoo have noticed that the past year has taken its toll on him. Liu Yuanyuan, a keeper at the Chinese Cat House, said that Shen always used to greet them with a cheerful smile. Now whenever they bump into him out and about, he doesn’t much look at people. “I don’t know what he’s thinking, but he looks really tired,” Liu says. Shen used to compose poems and post them on his WeChat Moments along with photos he took of the animals. Last year, however, he didn’t post many. When the pandemic hit in 2020 and people discovered how vulnerable the old ways of life were, the animals in big-city zoos became unsuspecting victims. A lack of visitors has meant that zoos worldwide have struggled to make ends meet. Neumünster Zoo in Germany lacked the money to buy feed and so put plans in place to euthanize some of its animals and feed them to those that remained. Meanwhile, an alpaca starved to death due to a lack of food at an indoor zoo in Changsha, a city in central China, and was discovered by staff with two arctic foxes gnawing on its body. That kind of situation is Shen’s worst nightmare. The year before, in 2019, Hongshan had gone through the traumatic experience of losing its beloved orangutan Leshen. A huge animal with thick orange hair who was born in the zoo in 1999, he was its star attraction. However, Leshen wasn’t keen on big crowds. When there were lots of people, he would huddle in the corner of his enclosure, facing away from his many visitors. He knew Shen, though — the two of them were old friends. Every time Shen came by, he would climb down from his perch, saunter over to the glass and sit down. Shen never looked down at him, and would instead always crouch down. When Shen put his hand on the glass, Leshen would put his hand in the same place. Leshen was highly intelligent and could brush his teeth, paint, and help his keepers tidy his enclosure. But after some time, he learned how to test the electric fencing with various insulating objects. On the afternoon of June 5, 2019, Leshen ripped open the electric fence using a bedsheet and escaped. After being discovered, he was anesthetized from a distance by a veterinarian. Leshen never woke up again, despite an hourslong attempt to save him. A Trying Year That crushing loss was soon to be eclipsed by even larger troubles. As 2020 wore on, the situation at Hongshan became evermore dire. The zoo is unique in that it is the only state-owned zoological institute in China to not also be state-funded, instead financing itself, with more than 80% of its revenue coming from entry tickets. In 2020, its income dropped by more than 30 million yuan ($4.7 million), or 40% of the previous year’s income. At its lowest point, Hongshan had a little over half a million yuan in its account. Shen thought long and hard, before finally deducting employees’ performance bonuses for half a year so the animals could be fed. It’s a common order of priorities for him. Bai Yali, the zoo’s publicity and education department head, says that most of the zoo staff’s computers and office facilities haven’t been updated for more than a decade.  Last year, more than 20 employees left the zoo. Near the end of 2020, some members of staff inquired via the company’s WeChat group chat when they would receive the money they were owed. Shen couldn’t give them an answer. At every meeting, the departments responsible for the animals, staff, and groundskeeping would talk about their funding shortfalls. Bai looked at Shen as he sat in the center of the conference room, feeling bad for him: “The thing was, no one could help him. Both the zoo’s animals and its staff wanted feeding.” Shen had his hopes pinned on visitors returning in droves after the lockdown was lifted. On March 15, 2020, the day Hongshan reopened after its 51-day closure, he arrived early at one of the zoo entrances to welcome visitors, dressed formally in a brown shirt and a dark gray suit. To ensure social distancing, guardrails had been installed along the zoo’s narrow paths and they had been turned into one-way streets. Security guards were also deployed at the narrow entrances to the various houses. A red carpet was specially laid outside the gate, with local media invited to cover the event. A gale had just finished blowing in Nanjing that had cleared the air, and it was an ideal day for a day out, bright and sunny with the first cherry trees coming into blossom. The resulting scene, however, was somewhat dreary. The few visitors that trickled in that morning were senior citizens living nearby coming to do their morning exercises. Since they were over 60 years old, they didn’t have to buy tickets. Hongshan had originally placed a limit of 20,000 entrants that day, but in the end only 2,247 people showed up. Growing the zoo’s number of paying visitors had already been getting more difficult with every passing year. Over the past decade, the annual number of visitors to Hongshan increased from 870,000 to 5.6 million, but only 1.6 million of them bought tickets. The other three-quarters were admitted for free, including the elderly, children, people with disabilities, and members of the armed forces, as well as groups specially classified as vulnerable by the Nanjing government. With 8.8 million residents in Nanjing, Hongshan is already at nearly 70% saturation, with little room to grow. The entrance price of 40 yuan has also remained unchanged for 11 years, despite the exponential increase in labor costs and prices. With disappointing visitor numbers, Shen spent the whole of 2020 visiting government departments and tourism groups which deal with Hongshan in the hope of securing bailout money. Bai says that Shen explained his fundraising progress during meetings at the zoo: “Where he’d been recently, where he’d be going next, and he’d give some materials (laying out the zoo’s needs). That would then be passed on down the levels.” Still, most of the time, nothing came of it. In August, not knowing where else to turn, Shen wrote to Han Liming, the mayor of Nanjing. After initially composing his letter, he hesitated for a couple of weeks making revisions. But after hearing that Han had reposted two recent interviews Shen had done on his WeChat Moments, Shen decided to finally send his letter to the mayor. Another couple of weeks later, the city’s financial leaders called him and said the zoo had been allocated 4 million yuan in emergency funds. The state-owned tourism group in charge of Hongshan later also lent an additional 3 million yuan to the zoo. These two sums of money couldn’t make up for the zoo’s huge losses, but they did give Shen a little breathing space. All the back-and-forth exhausted him. “I used to have so much passion, so much leeway,” he says. “Now I feel like I’ve run out of options.” He takes off his black-rimmed glasses and dabs his eyes, looking as despairing as a soldier who had finally run out of ammunition. It’s rare for Shen to feel powerless. In 2010, local authorities presented plans to build a square to the north of the railway station on 60,000 square meters of land that was in use by Hongshan, on the promise that the zoo would be compensated with another piece of land at a later date. But when the time came to sign the paperwork regarding property ownership and usage rights, for various reasons, there was no explicit mention of any “return” in the minutes of the meeting. Shen thought long and hard before deciding not to sign — a decision he stuck to for more than three years. When his superiors came to talk to him, he wouldn’t entertain what they had to say and stubbornly refused to sign. The area under contention is a hill forest, containing a large 7,000-square-meter lake, home to more than 700 animals including golden snub-nosed monkeys, onagers, and red-crowned cranes. If, after signing away this area, the promised land didn’t materialize, there would be no space for these animals. It was only in 2014, four years after the initial plans, that a city leader went to visit Hongshan. Shen explained his case as they walked along the paths together. After listening, the leader said that the land should remain part of the zoo. On hearing this, Shen shed tears. In the past, Shen overcame difficulties with great determination, but he no longer has the confidence. Employees are also feeling the pinch. Zookeeper Liu recalls that some team managers started mentioning during meetings that they might not be able to pay salaries the following month, just so that everyone could be prepared. Shen tried to put on a brave face in front of his staff. During meetings, he told staff: “Don’t worry about the money. I’m responsible for earning the money to support this family. You all just focus on taking care of the animals.” After speaking so confidently, Shen would be wracked by guilt: “They’d come to work, but couldn’t get paid — that’s really not fair. It’s really the ideals that are keeping the staff going, allowing the animals to live healthy and dignified lives.” Beyond Concrete In the book “Going to the Zoo is a Serious Matter,” science writer and zoo-lover Hua Shi — a pen name, his real name being Chen Min — rates Hongshan as one of the best public zoos in the country. In 2018, he announced plans on social media site Weibo to spend four months visiting 56 zoos in 41 cities across China, for a forthcoming book reviewing the country’s zoos. With 2 million followers on Weibo at the time, Hua’s trip caught the attention of the entire industry. In his book, Hua concludes: “Good zoos not only give visitors pleasure and knowledge, but ultimately translate those gains and insights into better behavior. These behavioral changes will reduce the pressure on the environment, making it possible for both humans and wildlife to live longer on the planet. For this reason, everyone is responsible for helping make zoos better. Going to the zoo is a serious matter!”  Most zoos in China, however, are primitive — putting animals in iron cages built on flat, concrete floors. Among this landscape, Hongshan is special, giving its animals the space and surroundings that allow them to retain their wild nature. Its wolves lie in wait at the water’s edge for wild magpies to come down to drink, before leaping out and pinning them down. They dig their own dens for giving birth. The animals in Hongshan are also afforded more privacy. Leopards are naturally timid cats, and their enclosure in Hongshan has multiple places for them to hide. In fact, visitors are sometimes only able to spot their large eyes looking out from the bushes. Hongshan also has its own ecology. In addition to housing the various animals, it has many indigenous residents, like the large gatherings of wild fireflies which appear in Bear Valley on summer nights. Occasionally, visitors can even encounter wild raccoon dogs and badgers walking around. A dozen or so years ago, Hongshan was a less respectable place. Ju Li, a deputy zoo director, has been working here since it opened in 1998, and for her, Hongshan at the time was lagging behind its already unimpressive competition. When she’d go out to take part in industry exchanges, “other zoos didn’t really want to have anything to do with us, since they couldn’t learn anything.” When Shen arrived in 2008, many of the animals had been caged up for a long time, often pacing around sluggishly. Years later, Shen can still remember the look in the eyes of one of the wolves. It was locked up in a hexagonal cage — each of its six sides 2 meters long — and no longer looked like a predator. The wolf took one look at Shen and quickly moved away, not daring to meet his gaze. Shen knows about the natural world’s struggle for survival. Before coming to Hongshan, he was more used to working with plants, having studied horticulture at university and spending seven years planting trees on Qixia Mountain, a scenic spot in Nanjing. At first, the mountain was desolate and the soil was poor, so he and his colleagues planted colorful maples trees. They planted seeds at a site just off the mountain, then once the seedlings were the width of a finger, they carried them up the mountain and planted them one by one. This period greatly shaped Shen’s view of life. When he was working on the mountain, he tried his best not to cut down any trees, saving whatever he could. When his colleagues caught badgers and small hedgehogs, wanting to bring them back to the canteen to supplement their meals, he would persuade them to let the animals go. Another time, after stumbling across a pheasant nest while constructing a firebreak, he quietly went around it with his colleagues so as to avoid disturbing them. Seeing the caged animals, Shen instinctively wanted to try and improve their lives. “The animals are living creatures, so we should treat them well,” he says. “This was my most simple and basic idea at that time.” Su Yuan remembers first meeting Shen more than 10 years ago. Shen had travelled to Beijing to attend a national training program for zoo directors, and Su — who was already a well-known designer of zoo exhibits in China — was one of the trainers. His impression of Shen at that time was that he was young and passionate. He’d taken on a big position at a tender age and seemed raring to go. During the training, Shen bombarded Su with questions about designing exhibits. Su remembers that Shen had a strong handshake: “It was a little too firm.” He could sense that Shen was eager to do something. Su, who requested a pseudonym because he works for another state-owned zoo, had visited Hongshan several times before Shen took over, and had been disappointed in almost every way. At that time, Hongshan had three hills, a topography no other Chinese zoo possessed. The exhibits could have been shaped according to the hills to provide a more natural living environment for the animals, but at the time, they were still of the concrete-and-iron variety. Soon after arriving, Shen knew he had a challenge on his hands. He held an all-hands meeting on his first day. He could feel a certain amount of weight and distrust in the room, as they looked at this industry outsider with a range of expectations. He was an expert in planting trees and flowers, and could tell if a plant was healthy or not just by looking at the color of its leaves. But here, his old theories and methods were out of place. Li, the deputy director, could sense Shen’s urgency. Shortly after his arrival, he made a big move and initiated an enrichment competition among the keepers. Enrichment, a novel concept at that time in China, is a low-cost way of changing feeding methods for the animals, adding perches and toys to help the animals exhibit more natural behaviors. Li had been working in Hongshan for many years, and advised Shen that it wasn’t realistic for the whole zoo to carry out the test, suggesting he select a few venues first. However, Shen was insistent. “He was urgent, but also idealistic. His pursuit of perfection was pretty extreme, wanting to run in whichever direction he saw as the best,” Li says. At that time, most of the keepers at Hongshan had never undergone specialized training and relied on what their older colleagues had told them, so they couldn’t complete the operations under this new concept. “First, they weren’t able to accept it psychologically. Second, we didn’t find the right methods. You can build climbing facilities for primates. But what about other animals? Like predators or birds? We didn’t know. So, the work couldn’t be implemented in the end,” Li says. Although Shen is no animal expert, he is serious and hardworking. His desk is covered with books and journals on animals. He spends much of his time visiting the zoo’s enclosures, and enjoys chatting with the keepers and sharing things he has read about. Li, who has a background in animal studies, is often listening to one side. If he hears something he thinks isn’t quite right but is too shy to say anything in Shen’s presence, he tells the keeper what adjustments to make after Shen leaves. Some Hongshan employees don’t share Shen’s enthusiasm for more modern zookeeping methods. Keepers complained to Shen personally, saying, “Why go to so much trouble? There’s no need.” One of the zoo’s leaders even insinuated to Shen that he was asking the staff to do more work without upping their pay. The enrichment drive ended in failure after 12 days. Li recalls that only a few of the venues managed to implement changes. With so few answering his call, Shen took it on himself to be the most enthusiastic. When Bai, the zoo’s publicity and education department head, mentioned that orangutans like bedsheets, Shen brought his unused sheets and quilt covers from home, as well as some stuffed toys. Once, he even went to the supermarket and got a pile of carton rolls and other waste. He asked the keepers to make small holes in the rolls and put food inside them as a form of enrichment for the animals. Once, Bai went to the old primate house and saw a small monkey locked up on its own. It was sick and sleeping in a cotton-padded jacket, but the jacket was so clean that it looked out-of-place in the old cage. When she asked the keeper who the jacket belonged to, she was told that Shen had brought it for the monkey. Respecting Animals From 2010 to 2012, Shen visited a lot of zoos in different countries. He was most impressed when he heard the story of the Przewalski’s horses as part of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria’s Ex situ Programme (EEP). This endangered breed is the world’s only remaining truly wild horse, and comes from the northwestern Chinese area where the regions Xinjiang, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia meet.  EEP workers had tried breeding the horses in captivity and releasing them onto the Xinjiang grasslands, but they all died in the first year. The staff was dismayed to discover that they had mostly starved to death. When snow covers the grassland, wild Przewalski’s horses dig down to eat grass roots, but the artificially bred horses had lost this ability. In response, EEP staff set about training the horses, covering their grass feed with a layer of ice so that they could practice breaking through it with their hooves. After several years, they were reintroduced again and, thankfully, this time it was a success. At that moment, it dawned on Shen that the highest level of zoo should aspire to be like the EEP — respecting animals’ true nature and protecting species. In the future, the ultimate value of a zoo should be to eventually provide animals for the wild if necessary. But in China at that time, there were two different voices. One was utilitarian, and believed that the aim of zoos should be to make money. The other took the moral high ground, arguing that zoos are inherently guilty of depriving animals of their freedom simply to provide enjoyment for humans. Shen wanted a different kind of zoo, and so devoted all his energy to the matter. First, he canceled all animal shows. The impetus for this move came in 2011, when the Ministry of Housing and Urban Rural Development issued its “Document No. 172,” which required the protection of animal welfare. For many zoos in China, however, animal shows were an important source of income, and so most places decided to wait and see how strictly the authorities would enforce the new rules. Shen, in contrast, was eager to move forward. Some members of Hongshan’s team objected to the change, arguing that the zoo would struggle to make ends meet. Li, the deputy director, recalls many meetings and a lot of resistance. No matter the opposition, Shen’s attitude was clear: “Our zoo should guide the public, not simply pander to them.” Six months after the animal shows were canceled, the number of visitors did indeed fall. When tour operators heard there were no more shows, many responded by asking, “What’s the point of going, then?” Shen came up with a range of ideas to try and boost income. For example, after the contract expired on one of the zoo’s parking lots, he reorganized the tender, with the new tenant winning the bid for 760,000 yuan. After the old tenant lost out, he began making trouble at the bidding site, threatening Shen by saying: “Just you wait. I know where your child goes to school and where you live. I’ll drop by your house for dinner.” Shen often finds himself facing skepticism over new developments in the zoo. At Hongshan, keeper Liu explains that whenever there’s a conflict between the interests of humans and animals, the animals come first. Since it’s cold in winter, the keepers applied for an oil-filled heater, but it took a while to get approval. “If it’s something for the animals though, the process is very quick,” Liu says. Some employees complain: “The animals are taken care of, but the humans aren’t.” Even Li has argued with Shen over this point. The cause was the keepers’ lounge in the Asian Primate House. When the venue was first designed in 2017, it had a spacious, separate area for the keepers. But during construction, Li found that the lounge was missing: Shen had turned it into an area for gibbons and golden snub-nosed monkeys. The new lounge had been relocated to what was originally supposed to be a corridor, less than 8 square meters in size, and rather shabby. He argued with Shen, asking, “Why can’t you give the staff somewhere nice? You take the animals seriously, so why not the people?” In the cat house, too, the keepers have to make do with an area of less than 10 square meters in which to prepare the animals’ food, and house their desks and computers for monitoring the animals. Shen explained to the keepers, “I only have a limited amount of money I can spend. When push comes to shove, I have to spend it on the animals.” Points of Pride The new wolf enclosure, which opened last year, covers more than 1,000 square meters on the slopes of one of the zoo’s hills. Ma Ke, one of the zoo’s staff members, designed the area over three levels for the wolves. The environment is both complex and diverse, scattered with rocks, groves and circulating waterfalls and pools. Photographs taken here really give the impression that they were taken in the wild. Each viewing platform only provides visitors with a view of part of the enclosure, meaning the wolves are able to hide from the prying eyes of visitors. According to Li, zoo afficionados have praised the new wolf exhibit. However, some visitors have complained: “This wolf enclosure isn’t good. Before, the wolves would run about inside and you could see them all easily. Now, when you go around a corner, you struggle to spot them.”  According to Chen Yuelong, a wildlife rescue expert at Hongshan, zoo directors have to be idealists, because when a zoo truly serves and protects wildlife, they need to lead from the front, sometimes going against what casual visitors might want. Shen is just such a figure. “Someone has to go first, and then he has to deal with the pressure,” Chen says. “The industry will only start creating better zoos when people realize that this is what a zoo should look like.” Shen’s mission is to create a zoo that better reflects animals’ true nature. In designing the Asian Primate Pavilion, Ma’s aim was to create channels that would allow the gibbons and golden snub-nosed monkeys to move easily between different venues. He wondered if soft netting could be used to make the passageways lighter, with several connected in parallel allowing the monkeys to travel between each pavilion. The proposal was opposed by almost everyone — only Shen supported it. When it came time to check and sign off the completed tunnels, the golden snub-nosed monkeys were the first to be released. The first monkey stuck its head inside, grasped hold of the soft netting, and then immediately rushed through it. Ma likes to think of himself as a rational person, but he confessed that at that moment, his eyes filled with tears. “It’s in their nature to enjoy swinging around like this.” Li has also seen some changes. After the new cat enclosure was constructed, three Amur leopards moved in. The concrete floors and iron cages had been replaced by a hillside dotted with trees. The leopards leapt around on the hill, clearly excited that they now had trees they could climb. After watching for a long time, an old keeper who had worked with the animals for many years confided in Li: “I’ve been in the job for decades, but I never knew leopards could climb trees.” Shen says his personal highlight of 2020 came when he visited Shanghai Zoo in December and saw Xiao Hei’s daughter, an orangutan a little over 1 year old, as small as a human baby. Within five minutes of meeting Shen, the baby orangutan was hugging him.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006844
Shanghai Normally Empties for Spring Festival. But Not This Year.,"As the Lunar New Year holiday begins, the Chinese city remains surprisingly busy, with COVID-19 concerns causing many to cancel their travel plans.",2021-02-11,"SHANGHAI — On Tuesday afternoon, Zhuang Junfei’s hair salon was packed with customers rushing to get their hair done ahead of the Lunar New Year on Friday. On the surface, it was a typical festive scene: Getting a haircut is a Lunar New Year tradition in China. Zhuang and his assistant were working on three customers’ hair simultaneously, to make sure everyone would get trimmed in time. But this year, the holiday has a very different feel. Zhuang would normally be jumping on a train the next morning to head back to his home village in Xuzhou, around 600 kilometers north of Shanghai. Instead, however, he’s decided to spend the Spring Festival away from his family. “I won’t go back home,” the 34-year-old told Sixth Tone. “It’s too much trouble for the rural areas.”  Many others have made the same call. The Lunar New Year often turns China’s major cities into ghost towns, as millions of non-local residents leave to visit relatives over the seven-day national holiday. But an ill-timed flare-up of COVID-19 infections has caused record numbers of people to cancel their travel plans this year. Chinese authorities, wary of the potential for large outbreaks during the annual travel rush, have called on people to “celebrate in place.” Migrants wishing to return to their hometowns have generally been ordered to obtain negative nucleic acid tests before leaving the cities and observe a health-monitoring period lasting up to 14 days after their return, during which they should avoid large gatherings. As a result, China’s Ministry of Transport expects the number of trips taken during this year’s chunyun — the peak period for Spring Festival travel — to plunge to just 1.15 billion, the lowest figure since such data began being released in 2003. Rail and flight ticket prices have plunged due to low demand. Zhuang, whose wife and 6-year-old son had already returned to the countryside before the measures came into place, said he’d spend his days off in Shanghai’s southern Minhang District. Around half of his colleagues planned to do the same, he added. “Most of the ones going back (to their hometowns) live within an hour’s drive,” said Zhuang. “Those whose families are in the countryside aren’t going back.” The hairdressers who have stayed behind have arranged to meet up for a pot luck New Year’s Eve dinner on Thursday evening, according to Zhuang. Though the situation isn’t ideal, it’s much better than this time last year, when Chinese cities were mostly locked down to contain the epidemic, he said. “No matter where you celebrate the New Year, everything’s OK,” said Zhuang. “At least the hair salon isn’t closed and not earning any income like last year.” Fifteen kilometers away in the central Changning District, convenience store owner Wang Fei also said she had no regrets about choosing to remain in the city over Lunar New Year. “It’s great that everyone is staying in Shanghai and coming to my store for their daily supplies,” said Wang. The 46-year-old, who is originally from the eastern Jiangxi province, has decided to keep her business open for the holiday, and has got her husband, son, and daughter-in-law to help serve customers. “We’ll go back home when it won’t cause trouble for the locals,” she said.  Normally, business is very slow during Lunar New Year, but Wang said the flow of customers hadn’t changed much this year. “Everyone used to go away during the Spring Festival, but this year everyone’s staying in Shanghai,” she said. “It’s still crowded in my neighborhood.” Yet some people have decided to go ahead with their travel plans. Li Rui, a senior at a college in Shanghai, flew back to her home city of Daqing in northeastern China on Feb. 5. Li had originally planned to fly home after her final exam on Jan. 24, but delayed her journey multiple times due to a COVID-19 outbreak in Daqing. Arriving into Daqing airport, she said she felt a little ashamed as she underwent a series of checks. “I felt like I hadn’t responded to the national call to spend the Spring Festival locally, and caused trouble for other people,” Li said. When she got home, however, Li decided it was all worth it. She’s currently midway through a seven-day quarantine at home, waiting to see in the Year of the Ox with her parents, grandmother, and family cat. “Spring Festival is all about coming home for a reunion,” she said. Correction: The sixth paragraph of this article has been updated to reflect the fact that some local authorities relaxed restrictions on returning migrants in the days ahead of the Spring Festival.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006840
Why China’s Elderly Are Still Waiting to Get Vaccinated,"Even with two domestically developed COVID-19 vaccines approved for public use, only adults under 60 are currently eligible for inoculation.",2021-02-10,"With 40 million injections administered as of Tuesday, China is in the midst of its largest-ever vaccination drive. But the guidelines for the two domestically developed vaccines the country’s drug authority approved in recent months state that only people 18 to 59 years old can sign up to be inoculated, meaning the country’s elderly — the demographic most at risk of developing dangerous COVID-19 symptoms — are left in limbo. “If there was a vaccine for me, I would sign up without hesitation,” said Zhang Yiping, a 67-year-old living in the southwestern city of Kunming. “But I don’t know when my turn will come.” Zhang had been enjoying her life as a retiree, traveling the world, including frequent trips to Austria, where her only daughter and two grandchildren live. But the pandemic has shaken up her retirement plans. “Without the vaccine, I have no immunity against the virus and could get sick at any time. I’m stuck,” she told Sixth Tone.  Globally, COVID-19 has taken a much greater toll on the health of seniors. Data on coronavirus patients shows that the older a person is, the more likely they are to develop a severe illness and die of the complications. “Elderly people tend to have weaker immune responses when facing an infection,” Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone. “Once they fall sick from the coronavirus, (the disease) hits them hard.” This was once again borne out during the latest coronavirus flare-up in northern China, which started in mid-December and, with zero new local infections reported in recent days, appears to be nearly over. The outbreak began among people mostly over the age of 60, who also made up the bulk of cases classified as “severe” or worse. The two people who died from COVID-19 during this stretch were 68 and 87 years old. So far, however, China has prioritized vaccinations for people in occupations that put them at higher risk of exposure to the virus, such as health care workers and customs officials. This decision makes sense, experts told Sixth Tone, given that China’s outbreaks have been few, and have proved manageable in recent months — unlike many Western countries that started inoculating seniors amid high daily infection figures.  Another reason is that neither Chinese vaccine has been shown to be effective in people over 59 years old yet. China’s first COVID-19 vaccine, greenlighted by regulators on Dec. 31, is developed by state-owned company Sinopharm. With the virus mostly gone in China, the company has been testing its product in other countries including the United Arab Emirates and Morocco. However, only people between the ages of 18 and 59 were enrolled in these large-scale, or phase 3, clinical trials. Sinopharm said its vaccine is around 79% effective in preventing COVID-19 in the tested population. “When we develop a product that’s completely new, it’s normal to test it on the healthiest people instead of the most vulnerable, like kids and seniors,” said Shen. “Once we have a firmer grasp of how well the vaccine works, we will definitely expand it to seniors.” Sinopharm did not respond to Sixth Tone’s interview request by time of publication.  However, with the world facing a virus that disproportionately affects seniors, other experts say it’s only reasonable to consider the most vulnerable when designing the clinical trials. “The whole point of a vaccine is to give it to the population that bears the highest risk of infection and death,” Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona in the U.S., told Sixth Tone. Not including such groups means a vaccine will offer lower protection to the population as a whole, he said. On Saturday, China approved the country’s second COVID-19 vaccine for use by the general public, a shot dubbed CoronaVac that is developed by Beijing-based company Sinovac. CoronaVac was shown to be around 50% effective in preventing COVID-19 during a large-scale trial in Brazil involving some 12,000 participants. Among those, just 600 people were over 59 years old, with an average age of 65.3. From this limited sample size, the number of inoculated participants aged 60 or older who fell ill with COVID-19 was not significantly lower than the number of sick seniors who, as part of the control group, had received a placebo: just two and three people, respectively. In an evaluation report on CoronaVac, Brazilian health authorities said it was “not possible to determine the effectiveness” of the vaccine in people aged 60 or older. For comparison, 42% of participants in the phase 3 trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was the first to win approval in the U.S., were between the ages of 55 and 91. Around one-quarter of the participants in the trials of another vaccine authorized in the U.S., made by Moderna, were aged 65 or older.  Despite insufficient data, health authorities in Indonesia announced Sunday that the country would start giving CoronaVac to people over the age of 59, saying their decision was based on the trial in Brazil, as well as a smaller trial in China. The latter trial involved some 420 participants, and the result — peer-reviewed and published in the medical journal The Lancet — showed the vaccine to be safe for seniors. In a statement sent to Sixth Tone, Sinovac said that because there is limited data on CoronaVac’s effectiveness in people over 59, institutions should “take into account the recipients’ health status and exposure risk when analyzing the necessity of administering the product” to the elderly. Chinese authorities haven’t said when they plan to begin vaccinating seniors. During a press conference last month, Wang Bin, an official at the National Health Commission, said the vaccine is being rolled out in an orderly way. With more data and an increased supply of vaccines, “we will expand the target group to include seniors aged 60 or over,” he said.  “I hope to get the vaccine because the virus is very dangerous to us elderly. But I also have some doubts, because the virus is so new and the vaccine even more so,” said Yang, a 61-year-old retiree living in southwestern city of Deyang. She told Sixth Tone that, because she had read in domestic media that vaccines developed in the West — which Yang reckons are more reliable and technologically advanced — have “many cases of side effects,” she’s less sure how to feel about the Chinese shots. “I think people around my age are the most eager,” Yang said. “We just retired and finally have some free time to enjoy life and take care of our grandchildren. But all of the fun stuff relies on good health.” Wang Jun, from the University of Arizona, cautioned that if China’s vaccination drive doesn’t start including seniors, a situation may arise where other countries are ready to lift travel bans but China still has its most vulnerable population unprotected. “We don’t know if the vaccines can stop the transmission of the virus, so opening up would put them in danger,” he said. “But if you keep the borders shut, it will seriously hurt the economy.” Zhang, the Kunming resident, said once she gets the vaccine and global travel is more feasible again, she plans to go to Antarctica, a dream trip that had to be canceled last year due to the pandemic. “I have, what, 13 years until I’m 80. That’ll pass in the blink of an eye,” she said. “I just want to fulfill my dream and go to all the places I want to before I can’t anymore.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006828
The Hidden Costs of China’s Canceled New Year Parties,"For Chinese businesses, the Spring Festival holiday is often the most important week of the year. But with the country still wary of COVID-19 outbreaks, many are having to tighten their belts.",2021-02-10,"ZHEJIANG, East China — In a cramped storeroom adjoining his pigeon loft, Zhong Shengliang is frantically counting a heap of eggs piled inside a row of plastic boxes. Outside, a truck waits in the yard, its engine growling. “I need to deliver them to the buyers before they change their minds,” Zhong tells Sixth Tone. For the 56-year-old farmer, Lunar New Year is always a crucial period. But this year’s holiday, which begins Thursday, could determine the fate of his business. A specialist producer of pigeon eggs — a delicacy that’s highly prized in parts of eastern and southern China — Zhong makes the bulk of his profits from the rush of corporate events, weddings, and family banquets that traditionally take place over the festival. The COVID-19 crisis, however, has flared up again in China at the worst possible time, threatening to deal Zhong’s farm a fatal blow. Though the recent outbreaks appear to have been contained, the Chinese government is concerned about the potential of a surge in infections over Lunar New Year, when millions of people traditionally return to their hometowns to visit relatives. Many local authorities have moved to restrict travel and mass gatherings ahead of the holiday.  The measures are causing Zhong intense anxiety. He’s already received canceled orders worth around 1 million yuan ($155,000) due to local bans on companies hosting New Year parties, he estimates. Now, he’s worried restaurants will cut orders even further, because they expect fewer families will eat out on Lunar New Year’s Eve. “My sales for the first half of the holiday season have been practically wiped out due to the massive cancelations of work banquets,” says Zhong. “My only hope is that families’ New Year’s Eve dinners won’t be affected that much.” Many businesses in China’s vast food and catering sector are facing a similar predicament. The industry, which is still reeling from China’s initial COVID-19 epidemic, is now struggling to cope with a second Lunar New Year disrupted by the virus. For China’s restaurants, Spring Festival is by far the most important time of year. In 2019, the catering industry generated 15% of its annual revenues during the holiday, according to the China Cuisine Association. When Beijing imposed strict lockdown measures just before Lunar New Year in 2020, eateries lost business worth 500 billion yuan in the first week alone. While this year’s restrictions aren’t nearly as tight, businesses are less able to ride out any downturns after swallowing enormous losses in 2020. Between January and July, catering revenues in China were down nearly 30% year-over-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  Zhong says his farm lost 2 million yuan last spring, as the decline in demand from restaurants rippled along the supply chain. The price of pigeon eggs, which normally surges to as high as 270 yuan per kilogram — 30 times the price of chicken eggs — ahead of Lunar New Year, fell by half. “While my pigeons ate feed every day, no one ate the eggs they laid,” says Zhong. “My farm can’t afford another season of slow sales like last year’s Spring Festival.” Restaurant owners express similar concerns, especially those running traditional Chinese banquet halls. Compared with other venues such as fast-food outlets, which pivoted to food delivery during lockdown, banquet restaurants have been hit hardest by social-distancing measures. Xu Weimin, a board member at a restaurant group that owns more than 20 banquet restaurants in Shanghai and neighboring Zhejiang province, says over 50% of his company’s sales normally come during the month of Spring Festival, due to the number of large functions held at that time of year. This year, however, the restaurants have not only lost all their corporate bookings, they’ve also been affected by a decline in wedding banquets, after a string of COVID-19 infections in the northern Hebei province was traced back to a wedding in January.  “Weddings used to happen all year, but now wedding banquets are mostly scheduled around Spring Festival, particularly in rural areas,” Zhong explains. “It’s the time for young people to return to their hometowns.” Around 10 weddings scheduled to take place at Xu’s restaurants in February have been postponed or downsized to comply with local virus-control measures, he says. Overall, Xu predicts the company will suffer 100 million yuan in lost revenues during Lunar New Year, compared with 200 million yuan during last year’s holiday.  Other industries struggling to cope with the fall in festive events include producers of expensive Chinese ingredients such as dried abalone, shark’s fin, and bird’s nest, according to Liang Ridong, president of the Guangdong Cuisine Association. China’s food industry has confronted several crises over the years, and industry insiders are hopeful that producers will find a way to ride out the pandemic. Zhong, the pigeon farmer, has already had to pick up the pieces after multiple setbacks. In 1994, the farm on which Zhong had invested all his savings was flattened by a typhoon. Zhong managed to escape to safety seconds before the building collapsed, but nearly all his 10,000 birds were killed. “There were around 200 pigeons that escaped,” says Zhong. “They flew out of the crushed cages and circled around the ruins, as if they were searching for their family members. I’ll never forget that scene as long as I live.” A year later, the farmer started again from scratch with borrowed money. The biggest lesson he learned from the tragedy, he says, is how vulnerable businesses like his can be. “Small-scale farms don’t have any ability to resist risks,” says Zhong. “In order to run a pigeon farm long term, it’s necessary to find a path to mass production.”  An unlikely innovation helped resurrect Zhong’s business. Until that point, pigeons were mostly bred for their meat in China, with the eggs sold as a byproduct. But Zhong was able to turn pigeon eggs into a profitable business by developing what he calls a “homosexual breeding technique.” In contrast with other poultry, female pigeons normally have to be paired with a male to lay eggs, and even then they only produce around four eggs per month, Zhong says. The farmer, however, noticed that in rare cases two females would pair up and lay eggs together. “If the two females start to kiss and preen each other’s feathers, that means they’re falling in love,” says Zhong. Gradually, Zhong learned how to pair up large numbers of female birds, meaning he no longer had to keep male pigeons. The new method vastly reduced his costs and made it possible to produce eggs at scale. “Before, the feed costs for a heterosexual pigeon couple to produce one egg were as high as the egg’s average wholesale price,” says Zhong.  The new technique brought new prosperity to Zhong’s village near the eastern city of Wenzhou over the following years, and won the farmer multiple awards. In 2017, however, the pigeon industry was hit by its biggest crisis in living memory, as an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu swept through China. Pigeon farmers suffered losses of 350 million yuan during the epidemic, according to the China Pigeon Industry Association. Chen Yitian, the association’s president, says it’s unclear at this stage how large the industry’s losses from COVID-19 have been, but they’re unlikely to be greater than the impact from H7N9. “Still, many small pigeon farms might not survive this year,” says Chen. “Big farms may need at least two years to recover.” This time, Zhong hopes finding new sales channels will allow him to rebuild his pigeon egg business once again. The collapse in Spring Festival orders has taught him that he’s too dependent on his banquet hall clients, he says. The farmer is trying to rebrand pigeon eggs from a luxury delicacy to a health product. The eggs contain higher concentrations of iron and vitamin B than chicken eggs, and in Wenzhou it’s customary for women to eat them every day during pregnancy.  Over the past year, Zhong has signed deals to supply eggs to the major Chinese supermarket chain Lianhua and other retailers. He has also opened online stores on Chinese e-commerce platforms JD.com and Taobao, though he dislikes the cutthroat competition on the sites. “Online buyers don’t know how to distinguish between high-quality pigeon eggs and the bad ones,” says Zhong. “They just go for the cheaper ones.” Restaurants, meanwhile, are simply focusing on attracting customers in any way they can. Hu Zhibin, who owns a seafood restaurant in the eastern city of Hangzhou, says he’s waiving deposits for bookings over the holiday and asking families calling to cancel their reservations to wait a few days before confirming.  After losing 800,000 yuan in business due to canceled company parties, Hu says he’s relying on families to show up for their New Year’s Eve meals. But it’s still unclear how many people will go ahead with those plans. “No one knows what will happen over the next few days,” says Hu. “Not requiring a deposit is one way to encourage people to come if the virus is under control by New Year’s Eve.” Early data suggests, however, that family celebrations are likely to be low-key this year, as large numbers of migrant workers heed government calls to “celebrate in place.” China’s Ministry of Transport estimates only 1.15 billion trips will be made during the 2021 holiday, the lowest number since records began. The pandemic has, at least, taught companies to become more adaptable, according to Liang, the Guangdong Cuisine Association president. This year, that skill is needed more than ever. “After last year, all of us have prepared ourselves for the worst, and we know how to respond to emerging situations,” says Liang. “We won’t be caught off guard like last year.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006803
Shandong Prison Officials Jailed Over COVID-19 Cluster,The officials were prosecuted for failing to prevent a coronavirus outbreak at Rencheng Prison that saw more than 200 inmates and staff become infected.,2021-02-08,"Local courts in the eastern Shandong province have handed down prison sentences to three prison officials months after they were criminally charged for failing to prevent a coronavirus outbreak last year. Liu Baoshan, the former head of Rencheng Prison, where the outbreak was reported during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, received the longest prison sentence at two years and three months, the Jining Intermediate People’s Court said in a statement Monday. His deputy, Deng Tihe, received a one-year sentence. Wang Wenjie, the former vice director of Shandong’s prison administration, was also handed a one-year sentence by the Jinan Intermediate People’s Court. In November, Shandong prosecutors said the three officials had failed to fulfill their duties, resulting in a serious coronavirus outbreak at the prison. In February 2020, Rencheng Prison reported 207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among inmates and staff — one of the largest prison clusters to that point in the pandemic, before other facilities began reporting similar outbreaks. On Monday, a separate district-level court in Jining also handed down prison sentences to two other prison employees: A driver received a one-year jail term, and a correctional officer was given one and half years’ imprisonment. However, both were suspended sentences, meaning the two will only be incarcerated if they break additional laws during their probation periods.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006829
The Human Side to Another Lost Spring Festival,"People from across China share how they’re celebrating the Lunar New Year holidays, dampened for the second straight year by COVID-19 outbreaks.",2021-02-08,"It’s the time of year in China when families jostle through crowds, shoulder-to-shoulder in packed trains and planes over the Lunar New Year holidays. For many, the journey to their hometowns is grueling, but spirits are generally high. After all, it’s the only time all year many of them will be reunited with their extended families to share months-old stories from their adopted cities over a hearty meal. But this Spring Festival, many dinner tables will again be empty, and would-be travelers may have to wait longer — possibly another year — to see their loved ones again. Some have chosen to stay put in the wake of strict measures imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even though the country has largely contained the virus. Meanwhile, others are being encouraged to cancel their trips in exchange for vouchers and cash subsidies. Still, some will remain undeterred and make the journey home. Sixth Tone interviewed eight people from different parts of the country about their plans for the upcoming holidays. Here are their stories:  Chen Jingting, 27, designerCurrent location: ShanghaiHometown: Yancheng, Jiangsu (pop. 7.2 million) I’ve been studying and working in Shanghai for more than 10 years. I will go to my hometown of Yancheng for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. The local government has announced that it’s not required to have a negative nucleic acid test if you’re returning from a low-risk area, but I was still concerned. I’ve heard a lot of news reports of people being pulled away for tests at train stations, so I’m worried whether that’s actually the case. My father and I are both in Shanghai, and I was anxious that we might not be able to spend the Spring Festival with my grandmother back home. I spent my early childhood with her while my father was working in Shanghai. As long as my hometown is not a high-risk area, I will find a way to go. (But if I don’t go home) I will especially miss the family reunion dinner. Now that I’m married, I can’t have dinner with my family on Lunar New Year’s Eve every year. After dinner, we usually watch the Spring Festival Gala (television event on state broadcaster CCTV), and then my older relatives will hand out hongbao (red envelopes stuffed with cash). I’m torn between taking the train and driving. We used to drive before, but this year there is a new high-speed rail line between Shanghai and my hometown. Driving is more tiring, but my elder relatives are worried that the high-speed trains will be unsafe due to the virus.  Ma Hongwei, 51, businessmanCurrent location: ShanghaiHometown: Shanghai (pop. 24.3 million) I run a business that delivers home-cooked meals. There are more orders this year, as more people are staying in Shanghai for the holidays. We’re relatively busier. We will prepare Shanghainese dishes for the Lunar New Year’s Eve feast. I generally don’t travel during the Spring Festival holiday. This year, I will celebrate the Lunar New Year with my wife and continue to work. My son is studying abroad and my mother is at an elder care center. Neither of them can come home, but I’ll go visit my mother sometime.  Peng Huanrong, 48, domestic workerCurrent location: Xiamen, FujianHometown: Zhoukou, Henan (pop. 8.6 million) Originally, I was planning to go home on Feb. 6 to see my children. But I changed my plan after the authorities discouraged people from moving around due to concerns about the pandemic. So I’ll be taking a break in Xiamen with my husband. He’s a bus driver and has to work during the holidays. If I had opted to go home, I would have had to take a nucleic acid test in Xiamen before leaving. I also heard from my father-in-law that, upon arrival (in Zhoukou), I would have to be quarantined for 14 days at a designated center. This frightened me. I heard that people returning in January didn’t need to quarantine, but I wasn’t planning to go then, as I was scheduled to work up until the holiday. I’ve been working in Xiamen for five years. My home is in the suburbs of Zhoukou, in the central Henan province, where my children live with our elder family members. I usually go home once a year and stay for about two weeks — sometimes during the Spring Festival holiday, sometimes after the holiday. I didn’t go home for the holiday last year. I went back only after the outbreak had subsided. Now again this year, we can’t spend time together for Lunar New Year’s Eve, so my relatives are a bit sad. But maybe I can plan to go home during the Labor Day holiday (in May).  Yang Youzhi, 24, delivery workerCurrent location: ShanghaiHometown: Xuzhou, Jiangsu (pop. 8.8 million) I’m a deliveryman who just came to Shanghai two months ago, after working at a similar job in Nanjing. This year, I’ll stay in the city to work instead of going back to my hometown of Xuzhou (in the eastern Jiangsu province), even though some of my colleagues have already left for their hometowns. There are more delivery orders during the Spring Festival and fewer employees, so I stand to make more money. I’ve made friends in Shanghai, so I’m not lonely. My co-workers and I will eat and drink together on Lunar New Year’s Eve. The company we work for will also give us some Lunar New Year’s gifts. Still, I miss my family...  Li Xingwei, 29, interior designerCurrent location: Wuhan, HubeiHometown: Anyang, Henan (pop. 440,000) I’m an interior designer working in Wuhan. This Spring Festival, I won’t return to my hometown in Anyang. My wife and I will go sightseeing in Wuhan to relax after an exhausting year. My hometown is in Henan (a province in central China), but it’s very close to Hebei, where there are still many medium-risk areas. If there is one new infection (in my hometown), I’m afraid it will quickly become a medium-risk area, which would make it hard for me to go back to Wuhan. Also, if the 14-day quarantine and nucleic acid testing are required, it will certainly affect my work arrangements. Last year, I had been home just one day when Wuhan shut its doors. For people working far from their hometowns, the best plan is to go home. I remember the streets and lanes in my hometown are busiest during the Lunar New Year. First, my family and I get up early in the morning and visit the tombs (to pay our respects to our ancestors). Then we go and greet our elders and close relatives. I like the lively, close-knit atmosphere there, where all the people in the village know each other and warmly say “happy New Year.” I feel that the big city lacks this kind of atmosphere.  Resident of Shijiazhuang, 54Current location: Shijiazhuang, HebeiHometown: Shijiazhuang, Hebei (pop. 10.39 million) The local outbreak situation is basically under control. Since early January, we have done nucleic acid tests about seven or eight times. In the beginning, we did them only once in a while, but later, we did them basically every other day. In past years, we would normally travel or organize get-togethers. We’ve spent previous Spring Festival holidays in Yunnan province and (the coastal city of) Sanya. This year, we didn’t plan to travel. My daughter is married and lives in another city (in Hebei), Baoding. In previous years, she’d usually come home for the holidays. She can’t do that this year, though, so I’ll spend this time with my wife instead. We’ve been asked not to gather (in large numbers), so we will obey the rules. It’s also quite troublesome to gather big groups together, right? Regardless, we are still planning to celebrate the holiday according to tradition, just the way we used to.  Zheng Li, 23, intern doctorCurrent location: Suining, SichuanHometown: Leshan, Sichuan (pop. 3.3 million) Because of the pandemic, I haven’t actually planned anything. My family lives in Leshan, and I wanted to go home because I may not have time in future. However, as many cities are encouraging people to stay put for the Spring Festival, it’s likely that our hospital won’t have holidays. I’ll probably spend the festival alone. I don’t have a plan yet. I’m not really worried about getting a nucleic acid test. Medical staff here are doing nucleic acid tests every week. If I do take a holiday, it will be for four or five days. I’ll go home to meet family and friends.  Tan Tiantian, 26, studentCurrent location: Durham, United KingdomHometown: Yichang, Hubei (pop. 4.1 million) I’m a graduate student at Durham University. This year, Lunar New Year’s Eve falls on a Thursday, and we will be taking classes as usual. My plan is to cook, eat, and party with the other Chinese students here. The situation in the U.K. is still quite serious, and there’s another lockdown in effect, so we are still taking online classes. But I’m OK and don’t feel anxious. In the school dormitory where we live, there will be some virtual celebrations, and the grad students might still get together to hang up chunlian (decorative calligraphy). The celebration should be quite lively. We will prepare special dishes from our hometowns. I might cook stir-fried meat with chili. There are also some students from northern China, who might make dumplings. My hometown is Yichang. This is the first year I won’t be home. My parents are used to me living independently, since I’ve been going to boarding schools since I was young. But they still feel a bit sad. Last year, I was home with my family for several months because of the outbreak. I actually feel OK about the change of plans for Spring Festival. After all, I’m not the only one affected.

China Reports No New Local COVID-19 Cases for First Time This Year,The 14 new coronavirus infections the country reported Sunday were all among people arriving from abroad.,2021-02-08,"The Chinese mainland on Sunday reported no new local cases of COVID-19 for the first time since mid-December. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday was just 14 imported cases, which were detected in Shanghai and the southern Guangdong province, the National Health Commission said in a statement Monday. This is the first time since Dec.16 that the country has recorded no new local COVID-19 cases. The encouraging figure comes as hundreds of millions of people are preparing to travel home for the annual Lunar New Year holiday, though passenger numbers have dropped significantly compared with pre-pandemic years. In recent weeks, authorities have stepped up measures — including nucleic acid testing, medical observation, and quarantines — to prevent potential outbreaks during the 40-day peak travel season, which lasts until March 8. Despite the strict virus-control measures, several parts of China, particularly the north, witnessed major coronavirus clusters in December and January. While some regions in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, as well as parts of Beijing and Shanghai, are still considered medium- or high-risk areas, Shijiazhuang, the capital of the northern Hebei province, has been given the all-clear after going into lockdown in early January due to a surge in infections. As of Sunday, the running tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 89,706, while 4,636 people in the country have died of the disease, according to official figures.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006825
Sinovac’s COVID-19 Vaccine Second to Secure Approval in China,The authorization comes just over a month after the country granted conditional approval for a vaccine developed by state-owned firm Sinopharm.,2021-02-07,"China’s top drug regulator on Saturday granted conditional approval to a domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine, more than a month after authorizing its first vaccine against the disease. The manufacturer, Beijing-based Sinovac, said in a statement that the National Medical Products Administration approved the vaccine based on two months of data from clinical trials overseas. The product, dubbed CoronaVac, has been undergoing large-scale human trials in countries such as Brazil, Turkey, Chile, and Indonesia since last summer. “We haven’t received the final data, so (the vaccine’s) effectiveness and safety profile need to be further confirmed,” the company said. Vaccine manufacturers can apply for final approval from the Chinese government after submitting complete data from their trials. Last month, health authorities in Brazil announced that CoronaVac was 50.38% effective in preventing COVID-19 in general and 100% effective in preventing severe and moderate cases in the country’s trial, which involved more than 12,000 people. The announcement came weeks after Turkey had said the vaccine appeared to be over 91% effective based on a small sample of participants from a large-scale trial. China’s drug regulator approved the country’s first coronavirus vaccine for commercial use last December. According to the vaccine’s developer, state-owned Sinopharm, preliminary results from human trials have shown that it is 79.34% effective in preventing COVID-19. Neither Sinopharm nor Sinovac has released detailed data from its trials. The companies’ vaccines were greenlighted for emergency use in July. Since December, cities across China have launched large-scale inoculation programs, targeting workers at greater risk of infection, such as health care personnel, taxi drivers, and cold-chain logistics staff. As of Wednesday, China had administered 31 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines, Mi Feng, a spokesperson with the National Health Commission, said during a press conference Thursday.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006821
On the Trail of COVID-19 in Shanghai,"The author, one of Shanghai’s top contact tracers, gives an inside look at what it’s like to chase after the coronavirus in China’s largest city.",2021-02-04,"It was a fine Wednesday afternoon in mid-January when I got the call: A worker at a hospital in downtown Shanghai had tested positive for COVID-19. So much for the workshop I was supposed to lead. I quickly shoved my stuff back into my bag, hopped on a shared bike, and raced back to my office. Prior to Jan. 20, it had been two months since Shanghai reported a locally transmitted case of the coronavirus disease. The last cluster, in November, was brought under control after just seven infections. But past performance is no guarantee of future results. This new case meant a whole new battle, even if the opponent was the same. My name is Pan Hao, and I’ve been a communicable disease investigator for more than two decades, first in the eastern province of Jiangsu, then, since 2008, in Shanghai. For most of the first 22 of those years, it was pretty anonymous work. Before the pandemic, most people had no idea my profession even existed. But that doesn’t mean my team and I weren’t busy: We conducted routine contact tracing and epidemiologic investigative work on a wide variety of outbreaks over the years, from influenza and hand, foot, and mouth disease to shigellosis and E. coli infections. Now, everyone knows about the “contact tracers”: the hazmat suit-clad men and women tasked with tracking down the source of each outbreak around the country, even if it means prying into residents’ private lives. The truth is, however, our work really hasn’t changed much from before the pandemic. We just shifted our focus to a new pathogen — and the public shifted its focus to us.  Detective Work I like to think of my job as similar to a police detective’s — they solve crimes, we solve outbreaks. Both of us need to identify and locate everyone who might be involved in an event, reconstruct what happened in detail, and protect the public by getting a killer off the streets. Maybe I’m biased, but if anything, I’d say contact tracing is even harder than cracking a murder case. In the latter, you’re only after a handful of people, at most. We need to track down dozens, if not hundreds of people for each confirmed case. That requires a lot of patience. Early last spring, when China’s COVID-19 epidemic was at its peak, my colleagues and I were assigned to find the source of two community clusters in separate districts on opposite ends of the city. Although we quickly worked out how the virus was spread within each community, we spent weeks — a long time in a crisis — trying and failing to figure out how the first patient in each cluster got sick. In both clusters, our tentative patient zero was elderly, and neither could give a clear account of their activities in the days leading up to their diagnosis. It was agony. We had no leads, and our bosses were pressuring us every day to wrap up the investigations. Finally, we caught a break at a routine conference that brought all the city’s investigators together. Putting the two clusters side-by-side for the first time, we realized that both patients had been in the same place. It turns out that, although they lived in completely different areas, they knew each other, and one had given the virus to the other. But that still didn’t answer the question of how the first patient contracted the disease. It would take another week, and countless phone calls to him, his family, and over 100 other people, before one of my colleagues was able to follow up on a clue that the man enjoyed swimming. We quickly discovered that the pool he frequented had been visited by another person who later tested positive for COVID-19. This patient’s disease was traced to a friend, and that case was traced to another cluster in a neighboring province. Only then could we declare the case closed.  Like ‘Trapping Rats in a Porcelain Shop’ So far, 21 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Shanghai during this latest outbreak — three times as many as in November. This time, the cases have been concentrated in the city center, just a few blocks away from one of the city’s most popular shopping and dining districts. And the residential area where the cluster was identified was an older neighborhood, sliced through by many narrow and twisted alleyways, making contact tracing efforts that much more difficult. But the real challenge facing contact tracers isn’t whether or not we can trace the source of the outbreak — we can. It’s whether we can do it without putting a city of more than 24 million under lockdown. As Zhang Wenhong, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital and one of the public faces of China’s anti-epidemic work, put it: It’s like trying to trap rats in a porcelain shop. We can’t let the rats run wild, but breaking everything while trying to catch them is hardly a solution, either. In this sense, Shanghai’s COVID-19 control efforts are actually quite relaxed compared with most of the rest of China. The typical COVID-19 playbook used in much of the country has been to immediately order citywide testing and shut down entire neighborhoods, districts, or even cities for outbreaks of just a few cases. For example, it’s almost a standard practice in many cities to lock down any building a confirmed patient has visited in the past 14 days and to quarantine everyone in the vicinity. That strategy can be effective, in its own blunt sort of way, but applying it to China’s largest city and financial center is not ideal. Our goal is to instead try gathering as much reliable information as we can about a patient’s movements, then use that to target quarantines precisely, so they only affect the people who are actually at risk. That means it’s not enough to know that a patient may have visited a particular building: We need to know exactly when they entered, which floor they went to, and who they met before we can identify who needs to be quarantined. The rest of the building’s visitors, who likely had no contact with the carrier, can go on with their lives. So, every time we identify a new patient, we need to ask them to recount precisely where they went every day, how long they spent there, what they touched, who they met, whether they were wearing a face mask, and whether they practiced social distancing. We use that information to identify which of their close contacts may be at risk of getting infected, then repeat the process for these individuals, their contacts, and so on. Of course, not many people can remember precisely what they did 14 days ago off the top of their heads. For younger people, who do everything through their phones, my colleagues and I can ask them to check their digital receipts and other info. Older people are harder. Some have poor memories, so we have to talk to their family members, and we have to follow up with them repeatedly. In general, most of the people we deal with are fundamentally decent. But even some who wouldn’t normally lie might refuse to reveal their contact and activity history, especially if they think what they would say could break apart a family or get them into legal trouble. In these cases, I can’t push them too far. All we can do is try alternative approaches, such as asking the police department for surveillance videos. Sometimes we’ll stare at those videos for hours, looking for clues until our eyes turn red.  Every Move You Make When China’s coronavirus outbreak first began to spin out of control early last year, I wasn’t surprised. During my 30-year career in infectious disease control, I’ve witnessed more outbreaks than I can count, some involving diseases even deadlier than COVID-19. I’m used to them. But I do hope that, in light of the damage done by COVID-19, the authorities will recognize the vital role public health workers play in protecting and shielding our cities from disease. All too often, we’re trapped in a kind of Catch-22: The better we do our jobs, the more it looks like we’re not doing anything at all. That low profile typically doesn’t spell big budgets. Over the years, low pay and lack of recognition has cost the public health sector a lot of talented workers. Many of my own former colleagues have gone to work at higher-paying private hospitals, for example.  Still, in a way I miss our anonymity. Now, when we knock on people’s doors, we come covered from head to toe in protective equipment. No one wants to see that. I would much rather be an invisible man, guarding the city quietly. In an ideal world, residents wouldn’t need to know anything about us, only that there are people out there watching over them, keeping them safe.

"Time Not Ripe for Cherries, Say Virus-Fearing Chinese","Sales of cherries, a Spring Festival favorite, have plummeted after some imported items’ packaging tested positive for the coronavirus.",2021-02-04,"This Lunar New Year, Chinese cherry sellers are losing their holiday cheer thanks to — what else — the coronavirus.  Prices and sales of imported cherries have dropped significantly after some package surfaces tested positive for the virus in cities including Wuxi, Shijiazhuang, and Jiaxing in late January. Although experts have clarified that a positive test result doesn’t necessarily mean the product is infectious, fruit businesses have still found themselves caught in the crosshairs. A Spring Festival favorite, cherries have long been beloved by Chinese consumers, though they’re often considered expensive: The term “cherry freedom index” was even coined to gauge people’s disposable income for small luxuries. In recent years, the production and export of cherries from Chile have steadily increased, with China accounting for 85% of the country’s exports, according to financial news outlet Yicai. Ahead of this year’s holiday season, China has imported more than 130 million kilograms of cherries, Yicai reported Sunday, citing a statement from the association of Chilean fruit exporters. However, wholesale sales in China are just 4% of what they were during the same period in previous years, while retail sales have plummeted by 63% from the week before.  Wu Shen, who runs a fruit supply business in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone that there would normally be high demand for imported cherries at this time of year, with nearly all fruit traders placing advance orders. Lower demand due to virus concerns in recent weeks has dampened sales, though they’re gradually recovering, Wu said. He added that smaller businesses like his would not be as heavily impacted as larger traders with vast stockpiles needing to be sold. “This week, the trading volume has been OK, but the prices are relatively lower,” Wu said. “Currently, it’s a little over 50% of what it used to be.” Still, many fruit sellers seem to be feeling the squeeze. A fruit vendor in the eastern city of Nanjing told local media that daily sales of their cherry products were only about 10 to 20 catties (a Chinese unit of weight equal to a little over 1 pound), while prices were about 50% lower than the previous year. The salesperson said consumers’ concerns over packaging testing positive for the virus have deterred them from buying the fruit, though the shop has put up signs saying its products have been tested. Zhang Lisi, a resident of Kunming in the southwestern Yunnan province, told Sixth Tone that cherry prices in the city’s markets change almost every week. She said they had dropped from 75 to 30 yuan ($11 to $4.50) per kilogram within a week at the fruit shop she frequents. However, Zhang said she’s not too concerned about contracting the virus from cherries. “If the cherries weren’t safe to consume, the authorities would have told us a long time ago, and there would be a sales ban,” she said. “What are we worrying about?” Before cherries, several food items including frozen meat and seafood also tested positive for the virus in China, which subsequently tightened rules on those imports. According to the World Health Organization, there is currently no evidence of people contracting COVID-19 from food items or packaging.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006792
Criminal Probe of Man Who Spread COVID to 82 Sparks Legal Debate,Experts say it will be difficult to prove that the traveling salesman knowingly flouted Tonghua’s disease control measures.,2021-02-02,"A police probe of an alleged COVID-19 superspreader and prosecutors’ involvement in it is stirring controversy among legal scholars who question whether there’s sufficient evidence that a crime was committed. Police in Tonghua, Jilin province, one of the hardest-hit areas in the latest outbreak, opened an investigation into whether a salesman identified as “patient zero” violated disease prevention rules. The salesman, surnamed Lin, was hired by a local retailer to promote health products to the elderly. Lin traveled frequently between Heilongjiang and Jilin, and held health seminars for 145 people. He was identified as an asymptomatic COVID-19 case on Jan. 9 and directly linked to 82 infections. Local police launched an investigation, and on Thursday Tonghua’s public prosecutor said it had intervened to guide the probe. At issue is whether the salesman violated China’s Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, the prosecutorial agency said Thursday. Under Chinese law, spreading a Class A contagious disease can be punished with a maximum prison sentence of seven years. But legal experts have challenged the probe. A crime is committed only if the suspect knows he has an infectious disease, refuses to follow directions, and deliberately violates outbreak control measures, said Liu Xianquan, dean of the law school at East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai. Based on information disclosed by local health authorities, Lin didn’t know he was infected with COVID-19, nor did he refuse to follow disease control measures, Liu said. “We can’t simply emotionalize justice just because he is patient zero,” Liu said.  Cai Zhenghua of Yingke Law Firm in Shanghai said the owner of the retailer — who later tested positive as an asymptomatic case himself — also did not take any actions that would constitute the crime of obstructing disease prevention work. Not all public events are suitable for judicial intervention, Cai said. As a last line of defense, criminal justice must remain modest, and the procuratorate’s intervention into police investigations should focus on supervision rather than guiding the investigation for the purpose of prosecution, he said. Staff at the Tonghua procuratorate declined to comment, citing confidentiality for ongoing cases. The investigation in Tonghua follows the recent announcement of punishment for a returnee from the U.S. who failed to disclose her COVID-19 symptoms, triggering dozens of infections. Longtime Massachusetts resident Li Jie flew with her family to Beijing in March as the COVID-19 epidemic began in the United States. She was diagnosed with the disease on arrival, and was later found to have concealed her symptoms to secure passage back to China. Li was given a suspended jail sentence for violating disease control measures, causing “a serious risk that the novel coronavirus would spread,” according to the verdict.

China Cracks Down on Fake COVID-19 Vaccines,Police have arrested dozens of people who were said to be manufacturing and selling fraudulent injections to the public.,2021-02-02,"Chinese police have arrested more than 80 suspects who allegedly manufactured and sold fake COVID-19 vaccines, underscoring the need to combat criminal networks exploiting the pandemic for profit. Police in the eastern provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong, as well as the municipality of Beijing, busted several networks that were making the shots with saline solution, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Monday, citing the Ministry of Public Security. Authorities said the suspects had made more than 3,000 doses of the fake COVID-19 vaccines since September. They have not disclosed where the fake products were sold. Since announcing a nationwide vaccination campaign in December, several Chinese cities including Shanghai have kicked off mass inoculation drives ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel to their hometowns for family reunions. However, authorities said they would only vaccinate certain groups at a higher risk of contracting the virus. Included are frontline medical personnel, transportation staff, and cold chain logistics workers, with plans to soon cover people over 60. China’s drug regulator has only approved one COVID-19 vaccine so far. Developed by domestic pharmaceutical company Sinopharm, it is said to be 79% effective in preventing the disease. As of Tuesday, China was second after the United States in terms of vaccine doses administered, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. China has thus far administered some 24 million doses, or 1.71 doses per 100 people. As COVID-19 vaccination drives gain momentum globally, Interpol has warned of “criminal organizations planning to infiltrate and disrupt the supply chains.” The international criminal police organization said in December that people had been advertising, selling, and administering fake vaccines, which could pose public health risks.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006795
China’s ‘Chunyun’ Travel in Photos,"Thursday marked the first day of Spring Festival travel, though with far fewer passengers than usual due to ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks in parts of the country.",2021-01-29,"Chunyun, China’s 40-day Spring Festival travel period, marks the beginning of the world’s largest human migration. In a normal year, hundreds of millions of people would be traveling across the country for long-awaited family reunions. But with authorities still engaged in a deadly game of whack-a-mole against the coronavirus, the Ministry of Transport has estimated there will be 1.7 billion trips this year by rail, air, and bus — a staggering figure, but a decrease of around 40% from 2019, the last non-pandemic year. For those who are still determined to make the journey home, even as more local, provincial, and central authorities are calling for travel to be avoided if at all possible, they’ll have to comply with rigorous public health measures and take every precaution to arrive safely at their destinations.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006781
Inside China’s Massive Crackdown on Wild Animal Farms,Farmers across the country have had to give up raising wildlife over concerns they could cause the next pandemic.,2021-01-28,"As one half of the “Huanong Brothers,” Liu Suliang shot to online stardom during the past few years with videos equal parts funny, cute, and mouth-watering — and invariably involving bamboo rats, the furry wild animals he bred for a living. But in September, the farmer-vlogger shared his last video about the rodents with his millions of followers, bidding farewell to his old business. Walking into his now-empty barn, Liu, 32, carries a bag of plush bamboo rat toys on his shoulder. “I wish the bamboo rats were this obedient,” he says, placing the life-sized toys inside the square metal boxes that once housed about 1,000 animals. The video includes a link where viewers can buy their own plush toys, Liu’s last attempt to squeeze some money out of his bamboo rat empire. Liu’s fortunes turned when, after an early outbreak of what would become the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to a market selling seafood and wildlife, China suspended the trading of wild animals in January 2020.  Immediately, a public debate ensued over whether the suspension should become a ban. Many newly emerged infectious diseases were initially transmitted to humans because of their close contact with wild animals — so-called zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola and SARS. Already, many Chinese were increasingly seeing the consumption of wildlife as uncivilized and, because wildlife breeding means there is a market for animals caught in the wild, damaging to nature. And then there was yet another argument in favor of stopping the practice altogether. In February, China banned all eating and related trading of terrestrial wildlife to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases. Prohibited from taking his bamboo rats to the market, Liu was one of hundreds of thousands of wildlife breeders in China whose livelihoods were suddenly in peril. As opposed to earlier crackdowns on the wild animal breeding industry, this time the government did not back down — even though it meant many lost their jobs in the middle of an economic downturn, and the necessary financial compensation posed an economic challenge to officials. After graduating middle school, Liu spent a decade as a migrant worker in the southern province of Guangdong. There, he discovered that people considered bamboo rats a delicacy and were prepared to pay high prices for them. It occurred to him that his village in neighboring Jiangxi province sat amid lush bamboo forests that could provide feed for the rodents. In 2013, he returned to his hometown to start breeding bamboo rats. Sales were going so well, Liu rented a bigger building just a few months before the pandemic began, ready to expand business. Instead Liu has had to entirely rethink how to earn money. After local government officials disposed of his bamboo rats in June, releasing some in the wild and burying others, he received some compensation for his losses, he tells Sixth Tone.  To help breeders switch industries, the local government has organized classes on how to plant fruit trees, and has provided loans. “The policies are good indeed,” Liu says. But he describes his current situation as “a gap period.” Over the past year, the livestreaming star duo Huanong Brothers — Liu and a former classmate — have promoted oranges and honey made by fellow villagers, helping them sell their wares amid the pandemic. In other videos, the duo dig for bamboo shoots, or roast pigs. But they haven’t yet decided on their next venture. Liu doesn’t see their online fame as a reliable source of income, and wants to continue raising animals of some kind. But he hasn’t figured out yet which animal is both easy to raise and easy to sell. One thing he does know is he has 33 species to choose from — in May, the Ministry of Agriculture published a “white list” of terrestrial animals allowed to be raised for food or other commercial purposes.  At the time, Jiangxi-based civet cat farm owner Rao Xiaojian felt “desperate.” Having bred masked palm civets since 1998, Rao had earlier survived a two-year disruption due to the SARS epidemic, which, scientists determined later, began when a bat-borne virus that had jumped to a civet cat then jumped to a human. But that suspension didn’t hold, and once civets were back on the menu, Rao’s business took off. Due to relatively low barriers to entry and quick profits, breeding wildlife was previously promoted as a way to improve local economies. Rao, too, convinced neighbors to join the industry, which helped them escape poverty and, in 2014, earned Rao the title “young rural entrepreneurial leader.” But after last year’s national ban was announced, the villagers turned against Rao and tried to pressure him into buying their now-unsellable animals. In May, Rao filed a lawsuit against a leading Chinese conservationist, Lü Zhi, who has openly opposed the commercial breeding of wild animals because it poses a public health risk. Rao alleged the Peking University professor thus infringed on the reputation of the industry. The court did not accept the case.  In August, one-third of Rao’s 8,000 civet cats were culled and buried, while the rest were released into the wild, following government orders. He received 1,650 yuan ($250) for each animal, most of which went toward paying off his debts, he says, adding that Jiangxi’s compensation standard is relatively high. In total, the province has paid out 720 million yuan to wild animal breeders. Now, Rao raises chickens. It’s not as profitable, he says, but he’s still adapting to the change. “Previously, the annual revenue could reach 5 million or 6 million yuan. Now, we can only make ends meet,” he tells Sixth Tone. “Transition is no easy thing. No matter whether you raise pigs or chickens or goats, it takes years to accumulate experience and skills.”  China’s wildlife protection authority, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, in October specified that the breeding of 45 wild animals species, including bamboo rats and civet cats, should be phased out by the end of 2020. Nineteen other species, including certain types of snakes, can still be bred but only for purposes other than eating, such as science or traditional Chinese medicine. Wei Ningxiang has a farm in southern China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region with 7,000 cobras and Oriental rat snakes he used to sell to restaurants. Altogether, farmers in Guangxi own some 20 million snakes, or about 70% of China’s total. A local official estimated that compensating all of them would cost some 3 billion yuan, a huge economic burden for the relatively underdeveloped region. As the national policies provided an exemption for medicinal uses, Guangxi instead is trying to integrate snake breeding into the TCM industry. An arrangement by the government, Wei signed a contract with a local medicine manufacturer stipulating that the company would make a one-time purchase of his snakes by the end of 2020 for 110 yuan per kilogram. But Wei is still waiting for the purchase to take place. “We cannot sell them, eat them, or kill them. Over the past year, our income has been zero,” Wei tells Sixth Tone, adding that, despite his 300,000 yuan debts, he’s had to keep investing money to feed the animals. Wei says many other people in the industry are as frustrated as he is: “It has been such a long year, and everybody is close to their limit.”  The medicinal market for snakes doesn’t look promising, and Wei says he has no buyer lined up for his next batch of animals. Nevertheless, he figures he has no choice but to continue. In 2007, he built the snake farm at a cost of 3 million yuan, and raising any other animals would require yet more investments. “The breeding base is designed for breeding snakes,” Wei says. In December, Li Liangchun, deputy director of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, announced that all wildlife animals currently banned as food had been disposed of, and that more than 90% of breeders had received compensation.  Among them was Zhang Bo, whose Asian bullfrog farm in Guangdong, which he ran without a license, was closed down by the government in September. Though he says the compensation he received — 16 yuan per kilogram, or some 20 frogs — was less than the market price, he accepted it. He says he had run out of money and many frogs had already died because he couldn’t afford to feed them. To support his wife, two children, and two grandparents, Zhang found some odd jobs in metal processing factories, earning 3,000 yuan per month. “The economic pressure is heavy,” Zhang says. He recently returned to his hometown in Sichuan province, in southwestern China, for the upcoming Spring Festival. He’s not sure what he’ll do afterward, he says. “I still have to find a way out.” The Huanong Brothers, meanwhile, release a new video nearly every day, but they no longer mention bamboo rats. In the barbeque videos they began making to show people how to turn the rodents into a tasty snack, they now roast other animals — and only those on the official government list.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006770
"China’s Holiday Travel Begins, Without the Usual Crowds",Presales of railway tickets over the Lunar New Year travel period have dropped by 60% from previous years.,2021-01-28,"In a normal year, hundreds of millions of people in China make trips back to their hometowns for large family gatherings over the Lunar New Year. But Thursday — the beginning of this year’s chunyun, or Spring Festival travel period — marked a pivotal shift, after cities across China introduced stringent rules to prevent potential COVID-19 outbreaks, discouraging mass migration over the 40-day holiday rush through March 8. National railway authorities said that around 4 million train trips would be made Thursday, a year-on-year decline of 66%. In Shanghai, a normally bustling travel hub, railway stations and airports saw far fewer travelers than usual. “Our parents’ employers have required them to stay in Shanghai for the festival,” a woman at the city’s Hongqiao Railway Station, surnamed Xiang, told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. “But our grandpa is alone in our hometown, so my brother and I are going home to keep him company.” Xiang’s parents are among the many who have either chosen to stay put over the holidays or had the decision made for them. To dissuade would-be travelers, the central government, as well as its provincial and local counterparts, have introduced new outbreak control measures including mandatory pre-departure coronavirus testing and 14-day health observation periods plus additional tests after arrival. Authorities estimate that the measures will result in a 40% drop in domestic trips compared with 2019 — though this will still amount to an estimated 1.7 billion trips, a slight uptick from 2020. This year’s travel slump has mostly affected China’s rail operators, with presales of train tickets dropping by a whopping 60%. Authorities estimate that 296 million passenger rail trips will be made during this year’s holiday period, more than the 210 million made in 2020. Airlines aren’t faring well, either. The average price for a flight ticket, normally sky-high over the Lunar New Year, dropped to 651.36 yuan ($100) earlier this week, as carriers have slashed their prices to compete for dwindling demand. Both airlines and rail operators have offered flexible policies allowing customers to change their travel dates or even cancel their trips at no additional charge. Meanwhile, authorities are continuing to roll out new travel rules and restrictions that are expected to further dampen people’s holiday travel plans. On Wednesday, authorities in Beijing said all inbound passengers over the 40-day holiday travel period will need a negative coronavirus test, and anyone from a medium- or high-risk area will be barred from entry. New arrivals will also be required to submit to 14 days’ health monitoring, as well as two additional nucleic acid tests during that time. Some cities in Jiangsu province, Shanghai’s neighbor to the north, have announced their own additional rules. For example, Nantong requires everyone from outside the province entering the city — everywhere, not just the suburban areas — to undergo 14 days’ home quarantine and two nucleic acid tests before moving about freely. The 14-day home quarantine policy isn’t nationally mandated, however. Amid some confusion about the rules, China’s top health authority on Wednesday clarified that travelers with negative COVID-19 tests would not need to quarantine but were advised to monitor their health, avoid mass gatherings, and comply with any other requirements set by local authorities.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006771
China’s Flight Prices Plummet After Holiday Travel Discouraged,"Amid ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, authorities are urging people to refrain from traveling over the Lunar New Year holiday unless absolutely necessary.",2021-01-26,"Flight ticket prices in China are usually sky-high during the peak Lunar New Year travel season — but not this year. Air travel prices for the Spring Festival holiday rush, also known as chunyun, have dropped significantly from previous years as authorities try to limit travel amid surging coronavirus cases in parts of the country. As of Monday, the average price for airline tickets fell to 651.36 yuan ($100), the lowest pre-booking price for Spring Festival flights in at least five years, domestic media reported, citing data from leading online travel and ticketing platform Qunar. In response to dipping demand, several airlines have slashed prices for popular routes. Flights from Beijing to the northeastern city of Harbin on Feb. 10 — the day before Lunar New Year’s Eve — are under 1,000 yuan, roughly half of their previous price, while flying from the capital to the beach resort town of Sanya costs 610 yuan, about 80% off the full price, according to reports. Yu Hai, a 29-year-old employee at a private company in the southern city of Shenzhen, told Sixth Tone he canceled his original ticket to his hometown in the eastern city of Nanjing after noticing the drop in prices. He said the new ticket he bought Tuesday was almost half the price, and he didn’t need to pay a cancellation fee for his previous booking. The Lunar New Year, which this year falls on Feb. 12, is China’s most important holiday, with hundreds of millions of people returning to their hometowns for large family gatherings. However, increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections in the past few weeks have scuttled countless people’s travel plans. To curb the spread of the virus, authorities in several cities have encouraged residents to stay put for the festival, with some also offering monetary rewards as incentives. People traveling between Jan. 28 and March 8, especially to the countryside, are required to get a nucleic acid test within seven days of their departure, as well as submit to 14 days’ health monitoring upon arrival, during which time they’ll have to take two additional tests. “My travel plan was slightly affected, as there’s now the need for nucleic acid testing, but it doesn’t bother me much since my company has arranged medical personnel to come and do the testing,” Yu said. Some domestic airports have also introduced stricter measures for passengers coming from middle- or high-risk areas during the travel period. For example, Zhuhai and Chongqing in the south of China have set up separate channels and registration requirements for people arriving from at-risk areas. Following the stricter measures, some have opted to cancel their holiday travels and stay put. Fang Yuan, a Shanghai-based communications manager, has decided not to visit her hometown in the eastern Jiangxi province over this Spring Festival. She said she arrived at this decision after Shanghai confirmed local COVID-19 infections last week and her home province introduced self-quarantine measures for incoming travelers. “I had initially brought a flight ticket, but when I saw in the news that I could refund the ticket for free, I decided to cancel it,” the 32-year-old told Sixth Tone, adding that air travel prices to her hometown haven’t changed much due to limited flights. “The ticket price wasn’t the main reason for my decision,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006757
Chinese Cities Vow to Better Protect COVID-19 Patients’ Privacy,"Beijing and Shanghai have said they will not release detailed personal information for contact-tracing purposes under a new “only mention locations, not people” rule.",2021-01-25,"Following multiple instances of COVID-19 patients having their personal privacy invaded, health authorities in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing are changing how such information is disclosed. The two cities have adopted an “only mention locations, not people” rule when divulging a patient’s travel history for contact-tracing purposes, state broadcaster China Central Television reported Sunday. Previously, health authorities would often share detailed patient information — including surname, gender, age, occupation, and address — as well as where they went and when. Such announcements, though helpful for contact tracing, have led to excessive personal information being shared in the public domain, with some people facing discrimination and online bullying as a result. In December, a female coronavirus patient in the southwestern city of Chengdu was bullied and slut-shamed after local health authorities revealed that she had visited three clubs, a bar, a restaurant, and a nail salon within a 14-day period before testing positive for the virus. In the online backlash that ensued, many people accused her of recklessly spreading the virus around the city. Meanwhile, in another incident earlier this month, people were quick to rail against outmoded gender roles after a couple’s travel history was published for contact-tracing purposes in the northern Hebei province, which is currently facing a surge in coronavirus infections. The information revealed that, while the wife had spent her days doing household chores and taking care of the child, her husband had been frequenting local internet cafés. Since the onset of the pandemic, many people have been sharing patients’ personal information and rumors of suspected outbreaks on social media, ostensibly to warn others. But such behavior has stoked privacy concerns and discrimination — and has even led to detentions. Earlier this month, a doctor in the eastern city of Hangzhou was taken into custody for sharing a COVID-19 patient’s personal information in a group chat, while another man in eastern city of Qingdao was fined and given 15 days’ detention in October for exaggerating the severity of the city’s outbreak. Last February, the Cyberspace Administration of China said information collected for epidemic prevention and control purposes should not be used for other activities, and entities collecting such data should safeguard it from being stolen or leaked online.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006752
"Running Out of Food in Lockdown, Jilin Residents Give Viral Plea","With several Chinese cities experiencing their first coronavirus outbreaks in months, local logistics are encountering some speed bumps.",2021-01-25,"Government officials in Tonghua, a city in China’s northeastern Jilin province, apologized Sunday for the “delayed delivery of living necessities” after residents who had been forced to shelter in their homes since Jan. 21 because of a local coronavirus outbreak launched an online campaign to alert authorities that they were running out of food. With a permanent population of just 400,000, the small city of Tonghua made big waves over the weekend as hungry residents took to microblogging platform Weibo to complain about their cooped-up conditions. As of Monday, 196 “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 — people showing symptoms — had been reported in Tonghua, according to the city’s health committee. Chen Shutong, a resident of rural Tonghua County, just west of the eponymous city, told Sixth Tone that her housing community had been sealed off, and only one person from each household was allowed out to go grocery shopping every three days. “Dongchang District (where the city of Tonghua is located) has been severely hit with supply shortages. Residents there can’t go out at all, and their front doors are taped (so authorities can tell if anyone is violating the stay-at-home order),” Chen said. “Many of us Tonghua locals were posting on Weibo, trying to make our situation become a trending topic to get the public’s attention.” As of Monday afternoon, a related hashtag on Weibo had been viewed nearly 300 million times. Ultimately, it appeared to elicit the government response the residents had been hoping for. Starting this week, Tonghua residents will be supplied with half-price “vegetable packages” to sustain them for five days, local authorities said in an official announcement. Over 7,000 cadres and volunteers will be assembled to distribute the foodstuffs to residents, and citywide nucleic acid testing will begin Monday. However, not everyone in Dongchang District — which local authorities designated a “high-risk” area last week — has seen these vows bear fruit. A Dongchang local surnamed Chen, who is not related to Chen Shutong, told Sixth Tone that while the vegetable packages were being delivered as promised to large residential complexes, some smaller communities, including the one where his family lives, are still waiting. “We called the community office repeatedly, trying to figure out when our vegetable packages would arrive, but all the calls went unanswered,” Chen said. “The food we have now might last us less than a month.” In the winter of late 2019 and early 2020, when COVID-19 was first detected in China, keeping residents safely indoors was among the most obvious measures for containing the virus. Yet the militaristic rigor with which shelter-in-place orders were enforced in many jurisdictions left some aggrieved residents second-guessing such policies. Now, amid surging infections in parts of the north and northeast, virus-plagued cities and communities are seeing rushed or poorly conceived plans lead to exasperation among locals. Residents of Beijing’s Daxing District, where three new confirmed cases were found Sunday, were transferred for compulsory quarantine at designated hotels. When local authorities refused to allow residents to take their pets with them, simmering indignation boiled to the surface on Weibo and other social media platforms. Finally, the district’s mayor on Sunday conceded that families with pets would be allowed to send one member home to care for any animals, subject to an in-house quarantine supervised by medical staff and community volunteers. Even Shanghai, which has thus far managed to keep the coronavirus at bay without imposing strict or otherwise oppressive disease control measures, has hit a few hurdles since 13 confirmed cases were reported in the last week. A Weibo user who said she was under quarantine at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center complained about the poor conditions there. In a statement Sunday to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center said it had assembled a team to assist with nucleic acid testing, personnel placement, and the distribution of daily essentials during lockdown. The hospital has been sealed off to incoming patients since one of the first cases in Shanghai’s new outbreak was traced there last week.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006750
COVID-19 Test Rule Gets Cold Reception Among Migrant Workers,"Authorities say new rules for holiday travel have been introduced to lower the risk of coronavirus outbreaks in rural areas where public health infrastructure is less developed, but not everyone is convinced they’re fair.",2021-01-22,"Chinese health authorities’ mandate that migrant workers should get tested for the coronavirus before returning to their rural hometowns for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday is facing criticism for singling out the country’s working class. On Wednesday, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said workers returning home for holiday reunions between Jan. 28 and March 8 should get a nucleic acid test within seven days of their journey. Then upon arrival in their hometowns, they must submit to 14 days’ health monitoring, during which time they will need to take two more tests and avoid mass gatherings. The move comes amid rising coronavirus infections domestically that have led authorities to implement various measures to curb the spread of the virus. However, the plan to test homeward bound people is only mandatory for those hailing from the countryside — the same requirements don’t explicitly apply to people traveling to cities. The disparity has raised discussion online, with many questioning whether it’s fair to migrant workers, many of whom aren’t afforded the chance to return home except over national holidays. One such worker, surnamed Wan, hails from a village in the eastern Jiangxi province and works more than 600 kilometers away, in the southern megacity of Shenzhen. The 29-year-old told Sixth Tone that the precautionary measures are “unfriendly” to people like him from rural areas. “I wish the measures could be more comprehensive, and take an individual’s living condition and needs into consideration,” Wan said. “The policy affects the group at the bottom of society. To Chinese people, the Lunar New Year isn’t just a vacation or a gathering, but a symbol of hope after a year of hard work.” Despite the additional hurdles, Wan said he is committed to going home for the holidays, though he wishes the tests were less expensive, or better yet free. Nucleic acid tests cost around 100 yuan ($15), though the price varies by location, and only a few cities currently experiencing outbreaks are providing them for free. A woman working in Beijing who spoke to Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity said she is worried she may not be able to return to her hometown in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The 28-year-old is an only child and had been looking forward to seeing her parents again. “My train ticket got canceled, so I booked a flight,” she said. “If that gets canceled too, I might have to spend the Lunar New Year alone in Beijing.” While the testing requirement will pose an inconvenience to many, the Chinese CDC said it has strengthened coronavirus-related measures in rural areas amid ongoing outbreaks mainly concentrated outside cities. In recent weeks, millions of people in Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Jilin provinces have faced stay-at-home orders or other movement restrictions because of local clusters. “The prevention and control in rural areas is difficult, as the precautionary capacity in such places is weak,” the Chinese CDC said. “Especially during the Spring Festival travel period, the number of people returning home and the increasing flow of people will further raise the risk of virus transmission.” The center’s assurances have found a smattering of support online. “There’s no discrimination against rural people at all,” wrote one user on microblogging platform Weibo. “When it comes to outbreak control, rural areas have many weak points. … If there’s another outbreak (over the Lunar New Year), it will definitely be hard to track to its source.” However, Wan views the measures as a “one-size-fits-all” solution that doesn’t allow for flexibility. “It’s only normal for people to be unsatisfied with this policy,” he said. As of Thursday, there were 1,674 active COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland, according to the country’s top health authority. Last week, China reported its first COVID-19 death since May, in Hebei, a province bordering Beijing that is currently dealing with an outbreak.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006737
Shanghai Reports First COVID-19 Cases Since November,The three cases were identified in a cancer center worker and two of his close contacts amid a citywide vaccination drive.,2021-01-21,"Hours after two hospitals in Shanghai were sealed off due to possible coronavirus infections, the city’s health authorities confirmed three local cases on Thursday.  During an afternoon press conference, Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Health Commission, said the new infections were reported at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, in the city’s downtown Xuhui District, and Renji Hospital, located in the central Huangpu District. He said the hospital had detected a “suspected” patient during a routine test Wednesday evening. That patient has been identified as a 56-year-old man who worked at the cancer center, while the two others were his close contacts, according to Wu. The man’s residential community in the city’s Huangpu District has now been categorized as a medium-risk area, a district official said, and all of its residents will be quarantined in designated hotels and tested for the virus. As of Thursday afternoon, some 6,000 medical workers at the cancer center had tested negative for the virus, according to Zhang Wenhong, director of the infectious diseases department at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital. Local media reported that workers at all of the city’s hospitals will also be tested as soon as possible. Both medical facilities have temporarily suspended their outpatient services, with inpatient services unaffected, Wu said. Patients requiring special medical attention will be transferred to separate facilities if needed. Shanghai had not reported any local coronavirus infections since seven such cases were identified in the Pudong New Area in November. Those infections were traced to cargo workers at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, as well as their close contacts. Reports of the new cases come just a day after Shanghai kicked off a mass vaccination drive. As of Tuesday, more than 800,000 people in the city had received at least one of two injections of a domestically made COVID-19 vaccine. As other countries have struggled to cope with mounting infections, China has largely managed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus and reopen its economy. However, recent weeks have seen a record number of domestic cases, highlighting the difficulty of containing the pandemic entirely. On Wednesday, China reported 144 new local COVID-19 cases, matching the country’s highest daily caseload since March 1, according to health authorities. Most of the recent outbreaks have been in the country’s north, including the provinces of Hebei and Heilongjiang, as well as Beijing. In the wake of the Shanghai cases, officials are urging residents to refrain from traveling during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday to prevent additional outbreaks. On Wednesday, China’s National Health Commission said migrant workers returning home between Jan. 28 and March 8 are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 prior to traveling, and must submit to a 14-day health monitoring period and compulsory tests upon arriving in their hometowns.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006736
Shanghai Kicks Off Mass COVID-19 Vaccination Drive,"More than 800,000 people have received the first shot in a two-dose course as the city ramps up its inoculation campaign ahead of the Spring Festival holiday season.",2021-01-20,"SHANGHAI — The Chinese metropolis of Shanghai has launched a massive inoculation drive to administer coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of thousands of people in certain at-risk groups ahead of next month’s Lunar New Year holidays.  As of Tuesday, over 800,000 people in the city had received at least one of their two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to local health officials. Inside Jiading Indoor Stadium, a designated inoculation site on the outskirts of Shanghai, dozens of people stood in line with their sleeves rolled up, ready to receive the domestically made vaccine from Beijing-based pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm. The vaccine is reported to be 79% effective in preventing the disease, and was the first candidate to be granted conditional approval in China last month. Health officials had announced a nationwide vaccination campaign in December in a bid to contain the novel coronavirus that has been ravaging the world for over a year. Authorities said they would first target those with jobs that may put them at high risk of contracting the virus, including frontline medical staff, customs officers, and cold chain logistics workers. Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of Shanghai’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a news conference Tuesday that about 240,000 people in the city have completed the vaccine regimen, which requires two doses spread two to three weeks apart. “According to the vaccine’s instruction manual, those who are 60 and older don’t fall within the qualifying age range for the time being,” Sun told Sixth Tone. While the elderly and those with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19, they’ll have to wait to get their shots. An employee at state-owned SAIC Motor surnamed Huang told Sixth Tone that she signed up for the vaccine through her company, which offered her an appointment even though she has no imminent plans to go abroad. “I have many friends in medicine who got the vaccine, so that convinced me,” she said at the stadium in Jiading. “Getting the shot put my mind at ease. If you get the vaccine, you’ll have greater immunity.” In the wake of recent flare-ups in the northern parts of the country, as well as the approach of the Lunar New Year, Chinese authorities have been on guard against the possibility of widespread outbreaks. Several cities across the country have been urging people to limit their holiday travels.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006727
"Migrant Workers Need COVID-19 Tests for Spring Festival Travel, China Says",Some are already worried the new precautionary measure could overwhelm hospitals and laboratories.,2021-01-20,"Update: On Wednesday night, China’s National Health Commission released the full outline of its plan for preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 in rural areas for the remainder of the winter and spring. Migrants who return to the countryside between Jan. 28 and March 8 are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 prior to traveling. Then once they arrive at their destinations, they must undergo a 14-day health monitoring period at home, during which time they will be tested twice and should avoid gatherings. Before returning to their hometowns to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday in February, millions of Chinese migrants have one more box to check off: getting a coronavirus test.  At a press conference Wednesday, China’s National Health Commission announced that people traveling over the holiday period will need to show a negative test issued up to seven days before their departure. The commission did not specify at the time that the rule would only apply to migrant workers. The Ministry of Transport estimates that some 1.7 billion trips will be made around this year’s Spring Festival — around 40% fewer than in 2019, when there wasn’t a pandemic hanging over people’s holiday travel plans. Even diminished by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks in northern and northeastern China, the world’s largest human migration is expected to put great pressure on the hospitals administering tests and the laboratories processing them. National Health Commission official Wang Bin described the situation as a “race against time,” and urged testing companies to return results within 12 hours of receiving samples. Some would-be travelers are already starting to worry about whether the just-announced policy could lead to overcrowding at hospitals. Zhong Chuchu plans to visit a private hospital after finding it difficult to make a nucleic acid test appointment at a public facility. The 28-year-old told Sixth Tone the Spring Festival holiday is one of only a few chances she has each year to see her relatives. “My family firmly believes we should all be together for the Lunar New Year, so I don’t want to upset them,” she said. China has reported over 750 “confirmed” — or symptomatic — coronavirus infections over the past week, and officials say more people are currently under medical observation than at any other time in the last 10 months. To contain the spread of the virus, many cities have issued their own policies for discouraging Lunar New Year travel, including plane and train ticket reimbursements and shopping vouchers for migrants willing to stay put. Wang Zijuan, a 50-year-old Shanghai resident, told Sixth Tone she recently canceled a planned trip to the eastern Zhejiang province to visit her parents, both in their 70s, because she was afraid the constantly shifting policies would ultimately disrupt her plans anyway. “Things are sure to get more and more stringent in the coming days,” she said. After the press conference, Wang Bin, the official, told domestic media migrants planning to travel for the holidays would need to pay for their tests out of pocket.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006731
Overwhelmed Hebei Lab Said COVID-19 Tests Were Fine. They Weren’t.,The person responsible for the Xingtai testing facility was detained after admitting negligence.,2021-01-18,"A commercial medical laboratory contracted to process COVID-19 nucleic acid tests in northern China’s Hebei province on Sunday admitted to falsely reporting negative results before it had finished screening all samples, some of which later tested positive for the coronavirus. At a press conference Sunday, authorities from the city of Xingtai said the person in charge of Ji’nan Huaxi Medical Laboratory, surnamed Zhai, had been detained for falsifying epidemic data after the facility had struggled to process hundreds of thousands of samples due to “limited capacity.” After learning that the lab had not completed screening before reporting its results, the health department of Longyao County in central Xingtai analyzed the unchecked samples and found three positive results. The lab had been responsible for processing some 310,000 swab samples collected during a second round of mass nucleic acid testing in Longyao County over two days. On Thursday, Zhai reported to local health authorities that all of the samples had produced negative results. Then on Saturday, Zhai alerted the authorities that there were actually positive tests among the samples, and admitted to negligence. After the error was reported, the county government announced a third round of mass testing starting Monday, and sealed off a residential community with 19 households and 59 residents. According to business data platform Tianyancha, local health authorities had fined Ji’nan Huaxi Medical Laboratory last April for violating medical waste management rules by not disposing of contaminated medical waste using specially designated receptacles. On Sunday, Hebei, a province of 75 million that borders megacities Beijing and Tianjin, reported 54 new “confirmed” — or symptomatic — COVID-19 infections, giving a total of 769 active local cases. The spike in Hebei represents China’s largest coronavirus outbreak in months, leading to lockdowns in three cities, including the provincial capital and another city administered by Xingtai.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006716
"‘Superspreader’ Infected Over 100 in Jilin, Authorities Say","Recent coronavirus outbreaks in northern and northeastern China have raised concerns over asymptomatic patients, as the country’s peak holiday travel season draws near.",2021-01-18,"A salesperson who traveled to China’s northeastern Jilin province is said to have infected more than 100 people with the coronavirus, raising concerns about its transmission via asymptomatic carriers.  The man had attended four health-related marketing events in multiple cities in Jilin, infecting at least 102 people, the provincial health commission said Sunday. The 45-year-old asymptomatic “superspreader” had traveled from the neighboring Heilongjiang province, which last week declared a state of emergency following a spike in COVID-19 cases. Health authorities said they began contact tracing after the man, who was a close contact of a COVID-19 patient in Heilongjiang, tested positive for the virus. Most of those who contracted the virus at the marketing events were found to be asymptomatic. On Sunday, Jilin reported 130 active coronavirus cases, including 40 “confirmed” cases, or people showing symptoms. The current spread has been concentrated around Tonghua City and the provincial capital of Changchun. Tonghua authorities have tested more than 400,000 people — the vast majority of the city’s population — with no positive results so far. Meanwhile, the city has imposed lockdowns on high-risk communities and shuttered all entertainment venues. Several cities in the north, including Beijing, have been on guard following clusters and outbreaks linked to asymptomatic cases. Earlier this month, Beijing instituted a 21-day quarantine period for inbound travelers after the virus was detected in patients after longer incubation periods. On Jan. 13, China reported its first COVID-19 death since May. Given the recent outbreaks, authorities in over two dozen provinces are using vouchers, phone credit, and other financial incentives to persuade people to forgo their holiday travel plans over the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people are expected return to their hometowns for festive family gatherings.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006715
Hangzhou Man Arrested for Developing Fake ‘Health Code’ App,"Mobile health codes double as digital passports in China, granting coronavirus-free people access to businesses and services.",2021-01-15,"In China, color-coded health-tracking programs accessible on mobile phones have become essential tools for containing COVID-19. But this week, a man in the eastern Zhejiang province was caught illegally fabricating the technology. The man, surnamed Xie, was arrested in Hangzhou for developing a “health code simulation” app that strongly resembled the health-tracking technology rolled out by the government early last year, according to a statement Wednesday. The 41-year-old had developed the app between April and May, and was able to “simulate the different types of health codes from various areas.” In China, each provincial-level region has an official app with its own distinctive health code. Although authorities said Xie had promoted the app by saying it was not an actual health code and couldn’t be used officially, he was arrested for internet crimes nonetheless. Sixth Tone was unable to verify whether the app had been accessible through major app stores prior to its removal.     To contain the country’s coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities in February rolled out color-based health codes — green, yellow, or red, depending on a person’s risk level. They can be accessed on smartphones through ubiquitous apps such as WeChat and Alipay, or on official government apps when traveling across provincial borders. These codes not only serve as digital passports granting access to services such as flights and dining out, but also track people’s movements using the registration details they provide, including name, ID number, phone number, and travel history.  However, though useful for keeping outbreaks in check, such tools have raised privacy concerns, especially after some cities said they were developing permanent technology for tracking people’s health status. Meanwhile, the mobile-based solution has also been criticized for excluding people who don’t use, particularly the elderly and economically disadvantaged. Prior to Xie’s arrest in Hangzhou, a Weibo user had shared a screenshot of his app that suggested it had been downloaded over 1,000 times and was available on the Google Play Store, normally inaccessible in China. On Tuesday, Hangzhou police told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper that they had received a report involving the viral post and were investigating the case.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006712
Chinese City Trains Surveillance Cameras on Maskless Drivers,"Tianjin, located near current COVID-19 hot spots, had traced an earlier outbreak to an unmasked man sneezing and coughing in an elevator.",2021-01-14,"Surveillance systems in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have been updated to detect bus, taxi, and ride-hailing drivers who are not wearing face masks, a response to concerns that they could become superspreaders amid the current spike in COVID-19 cases in the region. To allow for cameras in Tianjin to detect such drivers, the city’s traffic management department set up a database of drivers’ “relevant information,” local media reported Tuesday. Once maskless drivers are detected, their companies will be prosecuted if they fail to rectify the situation. The new policy also noted that maskless passengers should be refused. Though China has been successful in keeping COVID-19 cases low since the initial outbreak a year ago, there has been a spike in infections over the last month in several northern and northeastern provinces, leading to the government again ramping up containment measures.  Tianjin borders Hebei, a hard-hit province with 463 cases as of Wednesday evening. Three cities in Hebei are currently under lockdown. On Wednesday, the province reported China’s first death due to COVID-19 since May. China’s successful track record in limiting COVID-19 cases and the gradual relaxation of mask-wearing mandates have led to such rules being flaunted in situations where they still apply. Last week, domestic media reported that there had been 108 instances of drivers for China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing, and an affiliated company failing to comply with epidemic prevention and control measures such as mask-wearing. The two companies were fined a combined 1.41 million yuan ($218,000). Bus, taxi, and ride-hailing drivers are potentially potent infection vectors because they occupy enclosed spaces with many different people. After a Beijing-based ride-hailing driver tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, Didi Chuxing responded to public concerns by announcing that all of its drivers in the capital would be vaccinated within one week. Mask-wearing has been widely shown to reduce infection risks. A previous Tianjin outbreak in November was traced to a man with COVID-19 who had coughed and sneezed while not wearing a mask in two different elevators, potentially causing a local cluster of eight cases. China has one of the world’s most sophisticated public surveillance systems, with an estimated 560 million cameras. Many of the country’s surveillance systems use artificial intelligence to recognize people’s faces, or to spot litter or even unleashed dogs. The widespread use of AI technologies like facial recognition in China has also sparked privacy concerns. Experts say Tianjin’s use of surveillance cameras to spot unmasked drivers is a reasonable outbreak control measure. “Because we’re in a critical period of controlling the epidemic, there isn’t much to dispute about this issue,” Gao Fuping, director of the data law research center at East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone.“As long as the policy was ordered with proper notice to the public, there is solid legal ground to execute its rules.” Shanghai-based lawyer Ding Jinkun told Sixth Tone that, although stopping the virus from spreading is what should be prioritized at the moment, drivers’ privacy shouldn’t be completely overlooked. “There is certainly a serious knock-on effect to all of Tianjin’s public transit drivers’ behavior and activities being monitored,” Ding said. “Of course, for now, combating the virus comes first. But the policy should be canceled after the pandemic.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006709
China Reports First COVID-19 Death Since May,"A woman with underlying health conditions has died in Hebei province, where authorities are trying to contain a recent outbreak involving more than 400 cases.",2021-01-14,"China has reported the country’s first COVID-19 death since May last year, as the number of infections in the northern Hebei province continues to surge. A woman with underlying health conditions died of the disease Wednesday, though her exact location in Hebei has not been disclosed, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Prior to this casualty, China had not seen a coronavirus-related death for 272 days, since one was last reported on April 26. As of Thursday, 4,635 people in the country have died from COVID-19. The same day, a team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived in Wuhan, the central city where the novel coronavirus was first detected, to investigate its origins. Since the beginning of the new year, Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, has seen a surge in new COVID-19 cases, with the majority in the provincial capital of Shijiazhuang. As of Wednesday, Hebei had 463 “confirmed” locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, or patients showing symptoms. Of them, 16 are said to be severely ill, according to the provincial health commission. Days after Hebei went into “wartime mode,” Shijiazhuang last week announced a lockdown barring residents from leaving until the outbreak is brought under control. Most of Hebei’s outbreaks have been reported in rural towns and suburban villages of Shijiazhuang, while 70% of local cases are reportedly farmers, according to provincial health authorities. Amid rising infections, Shijiazhuang has announced a testing drive to cover the bulk of its 11 million residents. The city is also reportedly building a centralized quarantine site in a county some 15 kilometers from the city center, state broadcaster China Central Television reported. Local media reported that 3,000 mobile prefabricated rooms are being built in Zhengding County for quarantine purposes, similar to the “shelter hospitals” constructed in Wuhan during the peak of the outbreak last winter. The first 600 rooms are expected to be completed by Friday. The recent outbreaks, mostly in northern parts of the country, come as millions of people are preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday in February. Authorities in several cities are already urging people to refrain from traveling this year, while some are even offering financial incentives to discourage workers from making potentially risky journeys during the country’s peak travel season.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006708
"After Pre-Holiday Outbreaks, Workers Paid to Celebrate in Place","Worried about the coronavirus, local authorities are resorting to gift vouchers and phone credit to persuade migrant workers to stay put during the Lunar New Year travel rush.",2021-01-13,"This Lunar New Year, many Chinese cities want their residents to refrain from traveling. With a surge in COVID-19 outbreaks in northern provinces putting the country on edge, authorities in multiple cities are introducing financial incentives to get people to cancel their trips over the peak holiday season. This year, an estimated 3 billion trips will be made by migrant workers and others hoping to reunite with family and friends, but recent coronavirus outbreaks in some parts of the country have raised concerns that such traffic could lead to further spread. Wuxing District in the eastern city of Huzhou said Monday that it plans to earmark 10 million yuan ($1.5 million) in vouchers for people who stay home during next month’s New Year holidays, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. The district in Zhejiang province said those residing in Huzhou can claim their gift vouchers by scanning QR codes at designated locations, as well as through online portals. The vouchers can then be spent at various shopping outlets. Construction workers staying to work during the holidays will be offered one-off payments of 1,000 yuan each, with a total of 20 million yuan designated for this purpose, authorities said. The district also said it would provide cash incentives to migrant workers staying put during the holidays, though authorities have yet to disclose an amount, saying they have just started collecting statistics on the target group. “The vouchers were assigned to different departments, and the data collection work is currently ongoing for us to decide how many people will benefit,” Xu Zhoufei, a spokesperson for the Wuxing government, told Sixth Tone, adding that the district may partner with Ant Group’s mobile payment service Alipay for online registration. “We set aside this amount of money with the utmost sincerity, hoping to keep people here for the holiday.” In addition to vouchers, the district has earmarked 20 million yuan in cash for companies staying open during the Lunar New Year holidays, with each business eligible for up to 100,000 yuan, according to The Paper. The local government will also reimburse losses from train or plane ticket cancellations for those who have already booked their travels, and provide them with free public transportation in Wuxing until the end of February. The provincial capital of Hangzhou, too, has rolled out a subsidy plan for migrant workers deciding to remain there during the holidays, domestic media reported. Local authorities said they will bear travel expenses for 10,000 migrant workers who instead opt to travel before or after the holiday season. Migrant workers choosing to remain in Hangzhou can also apply for 20 yuan in mobile phone credit or 20 yuan in delivery allowances, according to the media report. Meanwhile, the city of Foshan in the southern Guangdong province has rolled out “gift packages” for local businesses consisting of coupons and vouchers to incentivize workers to stick around, according to domestic media. In the wake of the recent COVID-19 clusters in Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces, Beijing and Shanghai have urged residents not to leave over the holidays unless absolutely necessary. Last January, millions of people canceled their Lunar New Year travel plans after the coronavirus outbreak was widely reported just before the holiday. According to the Ministry of Transport, people made 50% fewer trips during the 2020 Lunar New Year period compared with 2019.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006701
"Sinovac Vaccine Less Effective Than Touted, Still Above Approval Threshold","While the 50% efficacy rate for a Chinese-made vaccine undergoing trials in Brazil is lower than previously announced, experts say the result isn’t surprising given the conventional technology used.",2021-01-13,"A vaccine developed by a Chinese company is 50.38% effective in preventing COVID-19, according to Brazilian health authorities who last week had said the same vaccine was 78% effective. During a press conference Tuesday local time, Brazilian health officials and researchers from the Butantan Institute, the biomedical center in São Paulo that ran the vaccine trial, said the revised number is based on different analysis criteria. More than 12,000 people participated in the trial for the Chinese coronavirus vaccine, dubbed CoronaVac, in Brazil. Of the 252 volunteers who contracted COVID-19, 167 of them had received placebo injections while the remaining 85 had received the vaccine, yielding an efficacy of just over 50%, according to Bloomberg. On Thursday, researchers at the Butantan Institute had said the vaccine was about 78% effective, without releasing detailed data. That number turned out to be only a partial result, Brazilian researchers said at Tuesday’s press conference, as it did not include trial participants who developed “very mild” symptoms. Sinovac, the candidate’s Beijing-based developer, did not respond to Sixth Tone’s request for comment. The Brazilian researchers explained their decisions by saying it’s more important to understand that the vaccine reduces the intensity of the disease. According to the country’s officials, CoronaVac is 100% effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19. Despite CoronaVac’s efficacy being lower than previously announced, the rate still meets the minimum requirement set by the World Health Organization for widespread use. “We haven’t seen detailed data being published, we don’t know the full results of the trial, and we don’t know if the figure is peer-reviewed,” Wang Jun, an influenza vaccine expert at the University of Arizona in the U.S., told Sixth Tone. With two Western-developed coronavirus vaccines reporting efficacy rates of over 90%, public expectations for vaccines have soared. But CoronaVac and another Chinese vaccine that was said to be 79% effective are made with a more conventional technology involving an inactive form of the virus. “Hardly any inactive vaccines have reached an efficacy of over 90%,” Wang said. Most flu shots are inactive vaccines, he said, and even in the best years, their efficacy rates are between 50% and 60%. “If the final result is indeed around 50%, that doesn’t mean it’s a bad vaccine, and doesn’t mean it’s useless,” Wang said. “Honestly, the most important thing about a vaccine isn’t its effectiveness, but its safety. Even if a vaccine is only 20% effective, as long as it’s safe, it’s better than nothing.” So far, no severe adverse reactions from CoronaVac have been reported. During a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Sinovac’s CEO Yin Weidong confirmed the announcement from Brazil. Based on clinical trial results, he said, “CoronaVac is effective and safe around the globe.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006703
China on Guard After Surge in Coronavirus Infections,"Dozens of new cases, many asymptomatic, are being reported daily in the country’s northern provinces.",2021-01-12,"China is stepping up measures to contain a possible widespread coronavirus outbreak, with Beijing shutting highways from a neighboring province amid rising infections. Since Monday, health authorities in the northern Hebei province have reported 99 new infections, taking the total to 695 — including symptomatic and asymptomatic patients — since the start of the new year. The majority of the new cases have been recorded in the provincial capital, Shijiazhuang, which went into “wartime mode” on Friday to contain the virus’ spread. Since the outbreak started, some 103 health care professionals from five provinces have arrived in Shijiazhuang to help local medical staff, while nearly 140,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the province, according to the country’s top health authority. So far, the source of the local outbreak is unknown. To curb the spread, two other cities in the province, Xingtai and Langfang, have been placed under lockdown. There are reportedly 16 people infected in Xingtai and one case in Langfang. Some 20,000 residents from Shijiazhuang’s Gaocheng District have been put in a centralized quarantine, though the reasons remain unclear. Since Monday, the northeastern Heilongjiang province has reported 37 COVID-19 cases, all of which were from Wangkui County. An additional seven infections — all asymptomatic — were detected in the city of Qiqihar, three of which were traced to Wangkui County. Changchun City in the northeastern Jilin province reported three new asymptomatic cases Tuesday, in addition to four such cases from the previous day. On Monday, Shenyang in the northeastern Liaoning province confirmed two symptomatic infections that were traced to someone who had returned from abroad and showed symptoms after their 14-day quarantine, according to state-run newspaper People’s Daily. Jinzhong in the northern Shanxi province also reported two asymptomatic cases Monday, both with travel histories to Hebei. The city has announced the closure of all elementary, middle, and high schools starting this week, with only high school seniors continuing to go to class. The recent spate of asymptomatic cases has raised concerns and prompted authorities to introduce strict containment measures. Last week, Beijing extended its quarantine policy to 21 days after finding evidence of longer incubation periods for the virus, and ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing has said it will inoculate all of its drivers in the capital after one of them tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms. Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist at Wuhan University, said asymptomatic cases are an obstacle to stamping out the virus because they can be so difficult to find. “When it comes to asymptomatic carriers, there isn’t a better way than what has been done in Hebei, which implemented citywide nucleic acid tests,” Yang told Sixth Tone. “People from elsewhere should surely stick to all protective measures, but there is no need to panic.” With the recent uptick in the number of active COVID-19 cases, Chinese authorities are urging people to reduce their travel plans ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in February, when millions of people are expected to return to their hometowns to spend time with family and friends.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006695
"76% of China’s COVID-19 Patients Have Lingering Symptoms, Study Suggests","Common complaints from 1,733 people surveyed six months after infection were fatigue or muscle weakness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety or depression, and lung or kidney problems.",2021-01-11,"Three out of every four people who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 in China still experienced lingering symptoms six months later, a study published Friday in British medical journal The Lancet suggests. Researchers from several Chinese institutions surveyed 1,733 adults who were discharged from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, the city in central China where the novel coronavirus was first detected, between early January and late May. The median age of the group was 57, and just over half were men. The patients were asked a series of questions about their symptoms and quality of life, underwent a physical exam and six-minute walking test, and had their blood analyzed. Then, between June and September, the researchers conducted two follow-up surveys at three-month intervals. According to their findings, 63% of the study participants reported fatigue or muscle weakness six months after their initial symptoms, while 26% said they had difficulty sleeping and 23% reported feelings of anxiety or depression. Lung or kidney issues were also clinically observed in over one-third of participants.  Overall, 76% of the participants reported or showed at least one symptom six months after getting sick. Moreover, patients whose infections were more severe were more likely to have lingering problems and require further care after being discharged from hospital. Though the Jinyintan Hospital study is the first to evaluate the long-term effects of China’s coronavirus outbreak on such a large scale, it is not without limitations. For example, the researchers said patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms who were treated at temporary “shelter hospitals,” or fangcang, were excluded. They also noted that they did not track whether participants had the same symptoms when they were hospitalized or developed them later, after being discharged. The study was authorized by Jinyintan Hospital’s ethics commission and funded by authorities at several levels of government, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Last February, the National Health Commission, China’s top public health authority, began keeping tabs on discharged COVID-19 patients. A senior hospital staff member surnamed Xie told Sixth Tone he had to report his health status to authorities in Huanggang, a city near Wuhan, on a monthly basis after he was deemed to have recovered from the virus in early March. Xie, who tested positive for the coronavirus in February without showing symptoms, said that some 900 residents from Huanggang’s central Huangzhou District had their health status monitored, and most mild cases like his did not give way to lingering symptoms. “I wasn’t experiencing any obvious symptoms after my recovery,” said Xie, who has resumed his management role at a Huanggang hospital. “What’s more worth noting to me is that most of us who became infected were suffering from fear of the virus,” he added. Deng Miao, a 41-year-old Wuhan resident, lost his father to COVID-19 in February. At the time, his whole family, including his parents and wife, tested positive. Deng told Sixth Tone that, although his case was mild, he has been experiencing insomnia and joint pain since May. “I don’t know whether my insomnia is a lingering symptom or just psychological,” Deng said, adding that he occasionally takes sleeping pills. Deng’s mother, who is in her 70s, remains so afraid of the virus that she doesn’t dare leave their apartment, even eight months since the citywide lockdown on Wuhan was lifted. She, too, complains of insomnia and takes sleeping pills on a daily basis, according to her son. But what worries Deng the most is the persistent chest pain his mother has experienced since being discharged from a shelter hospital in March. “We had her checked at the hospital about the tightness in her chest, but there was no official diagnosis, at least nothing related to heart disease,” Deng said. “The local health authorities frequently call us to check on our situation,” he added. Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist at Wuhan University, told Sixth Tone that, regardless of what the survey says, it’s still too soon for researchers to be drawing authoritative conclusions. Even for cases of regular pneumonia, Yang said, some patients can take months to completely get over nagging symptoms. “We should still wait another six to 12 months before conducting research like this,” Yang said, as “most of the listed symptoms should gradually subside as the patients’ immune systems bounce back.” However, Lu Hongzhou, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone that although the so-called lingering symptoms might not necessarily have been caused by COVID-19, the study is still an important reference. “We could see that many of the sampled patients were experiencing some clinical symptoms, but most of them won’t need to be hospitalized again,” he said. “The study can serve as a reminder that ‘recovered’ patients — especially those who were initially in serious condition — required more and longer medical care.” This article has been updated to include an interview with Lu Hongzhou of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006691
"With Active COVID-19 Outbreaks, China Fears Lunar New Year Travel","The upcoming Spring Festival usually involves billions of trips to see family. This year, officials and health experts are asking people to stay where they are.",2021-01-08,"In any other year, the coming weeks would see what is often dubbed the world’s biggest human migration: hundreds of millions of people traveling across China for Spring Festival, the first day of the lunar calendar that in 2021 falls on Feb. 12. But this year, Chinese health experts and government officials are urging people to reduce travel, or at least avoid peak days and large groups. They’re afraid the sheer movement of people during the Lunar New Year period could set back the country’s hard-earned success in controlling COVID-19, especially now that China is in the middle of one of its worst outbreaks since the coronavirus initially emerged roughly one year ago. Though most places in China haven’t registered new cases for months, a handful of localities face developing COVID-19 clusters. Shijiazhuang, the capital of northern China’s Hebei province, announced Thursday that people were forbidden from leaving the city after it registered more than 200 cases over the past week.  “With more movement of people in the country and sporadic cases popping up, the circumstances we are facing appear to be grim,” Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone. “Of course we want to enjoy the New Year celebration, but we also need to travel in a sensible and orderly way.” This year, the Spring Festival travel season, or chunyun, roughly spans from late January to early March. Commonly, this 40-day period sees those who live outside of their hometowns — students, white-collar workers, and the hundreds of millions of blue-collar migrant workers — traveling across the country to reunite with their families and friends. Nearly everyone is given a week of holiday, and many people take vacation trips to make use of the rare time off. Data from the Ministry of Transport shows that people in China make about 3 billion trips during chunyun every year. For comparison, last month’s holiday season saw an estimated 84 million people hitting the road in the U.S., where there are already local spikes in cases. “I expect the risks involved in chunyun to be greater than those in holiday travels around Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Yang Liu, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told Sixth Tone. She explained that chunyun lasts longer, involves more individuals, and relies more on public transportation such as trains, buses, and planes. Chinese public health experts say it’s unnecessary to halt travel in the country completely, but social distancing and other conventional infection prevention methods will need to be applied. “We don’t really have a drug for the disease, and most people aren’t vaccinated yet,” Zhan Siyan, an epidemiologist from Peking University, told Sixth Tone.  The Spring Festival period is a time for large gatherings, which only increase the risk of infection and should be avoided, she said. A recent string of COVID-19 infections in Hebei was linked to a wedding, an event commonly scheduled around the Lunar New Year. Last year, Spring Festival coincided with the emergence of the then-mysterious virus in central city Wuhan. An estimated 5 million people had already left the city before the authorities implemented a lockdown on Jan. 23. It came too late to avoid infections all over China. In October, those in China enjoyed an eight-day holiday in celebration of National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival and took over 600 million trips without them leading to any outbreaks. But chunyun is a different story, Zhan said. Spring Festival takes place in winter, a peak season for respiratory pathogens to spread. “People are often gathered indoors where ventilation wouldn’t be as good as in summer,” she said. “The risk (of getting infected) is high if there’s an asymptomatic carrier in the same room.”  Moreover, dozens of COVID-19 cases linked to cold chain logistics workers have shown that low temperatures allow the coronavirus to survive on surfaces and spread to humans. “We can’t rule out the possibility that viruses on doorknobs are still infectious, for example, especially in northern China where the weather is really cold,” Zhan said. To control and avoid flare-ups, the country’s COVID-19 prevention task force issued a warning last week about the risks of outbreaks during the holiday season. The organization suggested limiting all gatherings to 10 people or fewer and encouraging workers to spend the holidays in the cities where they work instead of returning to their hometowns. Local officials have also announced a variety of measures. Chen Bei, the vice secretary of Beijing’s municipal government, said last week that the city, which has recorded more than 30 new infections in the past half month, would “discourage” tour groups. Entertainment venues, such as museums and theaters, will be operating at 75% capacity. Street fairs and sporting events may not be held. Beijing residents, meanwhile, are being asked not to leave the capital. “Party and government officials will set an example and celebrate the holiday in Beijing,” Chen said during a press conference. “Don’t leave Beijing unless necessary … those who absolutely have to leave need to be managed by a strict approval process.” “Given that much of chunyun will rely on public transportation, staying local when possible is the sensible and responsible choice considering COVID-19 prevention and control,” said Liu, the researcher in London. Recognizing these risks, Wang Xiuchun, an officer at the Ministry of Transport, said during a press conference last week that public transportation workers would be given priority access to COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, trains will reserve isolated “quarantine seats” for passengers suddenly showing fever-like symptoms during their trip.  Chunyun travel also puts pressure on rural areas and less-developed cities, which see a massive influx of people this time of year but lack the health care infrastructure needed to cope with emergencies. According to Liu, the movement creates a mismatch of population and medical resources, which the initial coronavirus outbreak in China shows can have severe consequences. Of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Hebei, over 80% of cases were found in rural areas. China’s national health commision held a meeting last week requesting local authorities to “enhance resource reserves and staff preparedness” in rural areas and “strictly prevent sporadic cases from spreading and transmitting.” Some local governments have rolled out strict testing and quarantine policies for people returning home. Authorities in the central Chinese city of Luoyang said returnees must be quarantined at home for 14 days during which they would be tested twice for COVID-19 if they returned from areas with no current cases. Those who return from areas with known outbreaks will be quarantined at designated facilities for two weeks. Several cities and counties in the eastern Anhui province have issued a letter urging migrant workers, who account for half of the province’s labor force, to spend Lunar New Year in the cities where they live. Those who do return will need a negative COVID-19 test or get tested on arrival.  “Each locality should customize its policies based on its own ability,” Shen, the infectious disease expert, said. “For example, less developed areas may not have the medical resources to treat the disease, but at least they can implement quarantines to stop the spread.” Shen said while he understood that families want to be together, the public needs to follow COVID-19 prevention measures. “Going to places with current clusters is not a responsible choice,” he said. “Telling people to reduce travel may sound cold, but it’s to protect them.” The warnings have left countless Chinese weighing whether to travel or stay put this year. Their choice might be especially difficult seeing as last year’s Spring Festival was also disrupted by COVID-19. According to data from the Ministry of Transport, people made 50% fewer trips during 2020’s Lunar New Year period than in 2019.  Wang Sida couldn’t go home last year because the virus was raging in his hometown of Huanggang, a city close to initial epicenter Wuhan. Going back was too risky, he told Sixth Tone. So the 27-year-old spent Spring Festival in Beijing, where he works, away from his family. “After last year’s ‘special’ New Year, I realized how challenging reunions can be. So I want to go home even more this year to be with my parents,” he said. “But I’m not certain if I still can.” With China now seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases and the Beijing government suggesting everyone stay in town, Wang fears his employer, an internet company, will ban all staff from traveling. He is reluctant to book a ticket to Huanggang. “I’ll be really down if I can’t go back home,” he said. “I don’t know what I’ll do then.” Lin, a 36-year-old Wuhan native currently living in the eastern city Taizhou, has made plans to travel back home with his wife and two children to visit his parents on Feb. 9, three days before Lunar New Year Day. Last year, he wasn’t able to visit as Wuhan battled the outbreak of COVID-19. “If there’s no major change in the outbreak situation, I won’t change my plan,” Lin told Sixth Tone. Although he already traveled home over the October vacation, the Lunar New Year holiday feels different. “We Wuhan people have traditional foods that we only eat during Lunar New Year,” he said. “My mom told me she has prepared cured sausages and meats, just waiting for me to come back.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006686
"Second Chinese COVID-19 Vaccine 78% Effective, Brazil Says",Thursday’s announcement from a trial in Brazil suggests coronavirus vaccines made by Sinopharm and Sinovac have roughly the same efficacy rates.,2021-01-08,"Authorities in Brazil have released the long-anticipated results for a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine trial in the South American country, saying it appears to be 78% effective in preventing the disease. Dimas Covas, director of the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, which conducted the clinical trial, also said during a press conference Thursday that the vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinovac can prevent severe cases of COVID-19 from developing 100% of the time. The vaccine, dubbed CoronaVac, is the second Chinese coronavirus vaccine shown to be effective in large-scale human trials. Last week, another Chinese pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm, said its vaccine is 79% effective. No detailed data on either vaccine trial has been released to the public. In December, Brazil announced that CoronaVac had shown an efficacy of above 50%, without giving a more precise figure. Authorities in the country said Sinovac had requested that the announcement of an efficacy rate be postponed so the company could gather and analyze data from trials being conducted in other countries including Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile. In November, the Brazilian government suspended CoronaVac’s late-stage trial due to an unspecified “adverse event.” According to Reuters, the incident was an unrelated suicide, and authorities resumed the trial within two days.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006684
Shijiazhuang on Lockdown Over Local COVID-19 Outbreak,"After over 200 cases were reported this week, residents have been told they cannot leave the city until the outbreak is brought under control.",2021-01-08,"The capital of northern China’s Hebei province has barred people from leaving the city following a surge in local COVID-19 cases. Residents and vehicles in Shijiazhuang must remain in the city until the outbreak is brought under control, according to a press conference Thursday. Residents of Gaocheng District, which has been designated “high-risk,” are prohibited from going elsewhere in the city, which has also imposed movement restrictions in other areas. From Saturday to Wednesday, Shijiazhuang reported 83 new “confirmed” cases — people showing signs of COVID-19 infection — as well as 148 asymptomatic cases. Hebei’s health commission announced Friday that the province had recorded 33 new local confirmed infections the day before, with 31 of them from Shijiazhuang. As of Friday, there are 123 known local confirmed cases in the province. On Tuesday, Hebei went into “wartime mode,” imposing stringent outbreak control measures, and on Wednesday, Shijiazhuang launched a citywide campaign to test the bulk of its 11 million residents. As of Thursday, city authorities had collected more than 6 million samples, according to the press conference. Other cities in the province are also testing residents. Authorities in Nangong, less than two hours’ drive from Shijiazhuang, announced Friday that residents could earn 500 yuan ($77) for reporting anyone who had not been tested.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006683
"In Virus-Free Wuhan, Businesses Are Still Recovering",Local entrepreneurs say many companies remain closed more than half a year after the city’s lockdown ended.,2021-01-07,"It’s been seven months since Wuhan, the city in central China where the COVID-19 pandemic began, last recorded a local infection. But Cui’s restaurant business has yet to return to full health. Usually, Cui spends the Spring Festival period serving a seasonal rush of diners. But last year, after local authorities finally admitted that the mysterious new virus that had been sickening people could be transmitted between humans, Wuhan went into lockdown on Jan. 23. “The change was earth-shaking,” Cui tells Sixth Tone. As people were forced to stay home, the government paid his restaurant to deliver meals to medical workers and quarantine sites, helping him stay afloat. Cui thought the crisis wouldn’t last long, and it would soon be business as usual. But after Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted on April 8, the traumatized city was still wary of a resurgence. The government set strict reopening conditions for dine-in services, delaying when Cui’s restaurant could return to normal operations by months. Worse still, customers stayed away, because they feared infection from the quarantine site next door.  The last time symptomatic COVID-19 cases were detected in Wuhan was in May, and life in the city, as in most of China, has returned to normal. But Cui’s business is still largely reliant on takeout and boxed lunch orders. “Many people in Wuhan are still afraid to dine out, and there are much fewer tourists than before,” Cui says. Many Wuhan business owners like Cui are struggling with the lingering effects of the country’s epidemic. The economies of most of China’s provinces — none of which were nearly as hardly hit by COVID-19 as Hubei, where Wuhan is located — are growing again following a dip during the early outbreak. Hubei, however, was one of just four provinces whose economies contracted during the first three quarters of 2020, the most recent period for which figures are available. Its GDP shrank by 10.4% year-over-year. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were especially hard-hit during China’s pandemic downturn. They usually have less money on hand and have a tougher time obtaining credit. In Wuhan, 98% of the city’s 1.3 million market entities are SMEs and sole-proprietorship businesses, said Zhang Hong, deputy chief of Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Economics and Information Technology, during a press conference in May.  According to Luo Zhi, director of Wuhan University’s China New Private Enterprise Economy Research Center, the smaller the enterprises, the greater the difficulty they face in recovery. “It’s very noticeable this year that a lot of companies have seen a sharp decline in orders,” she tells Sixth Tone. “Even if they survive, they will have to spend heavily on fixed costs without enjoying good profits.” Cui’s restaurant, which is located in the city’s Wuchang District and serves Cantonese food, is paying about 250,000 yuan (nearly $39,000) in rent, utilities, and staff salaries every month, despite monthly revenues barely exceeding 100,000 yuan, he says. Across the country, many smaller companies have disappeared. A survey project last year on entrepreneurship in China, led by researchers from Peking University, interviewed 2,500 SMEs in seven provinces and municipalities — excluding Hubei. Between the first round of calls at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, and the second round in May when China’s infection numbers had gone way down, 18% of respondents had closed their businesses for good. While labor shortages and logistics disruptions as regions of China went into various lockdowns were the main issues, the survey showed the biggest current challenge to be a lack of demand. Over 70% of the firms surveyed in May listed it as their top challenge. Both domestic and international demand is still not back to its regular level, Luo says. The picture appears even grimmer in Hubei. Cui, who is also the vice chair of the Hubei Culinary and Hotel Industry Association, estimates only around half of the restaurants in Wuhan survived the lockdown.   “Many businesses in Wuhan are still struggling,” Chen Hui, general manager at Wuhan Tianli Fresh Food Distribution Technology Company, tells Sixth Tone. “A lot of store fronts are closed, and only a few businesses remain open in the industrial park we are in.” Chen’s company, which is primarily engaged in the packaging, distribution, and cold chain logistics of agricultural products, has experienced a sharp drop in revenue as a result of uncollectible payments and a decline in clients. One major group of customers are hotels and restaurants in the area, but, she says, many of them seem to have closed — either temporarily or for good. “The whole industry is lacking cash flow,” Chen says. Her company currently owes more than 300,000 yuan in unpaid wages to employees and rent to the industrial park. To provide financial support for businesses, the Wuhan government in April announced a bailout fund of 40 billion yuan, providing one-year interest-free loans for local SMEs. Later, another 20 billion yuan was added to offer subsidies on loan interest for sole-proprietorship businesses. As of late September, the size of the fund had been expanded to 100 billion yuan, with the extra 40 billion yuan giving guaranteed support to make it easier for local SMEs to apply for loans.  Local authorities have also provided several tax and rent relief policies. In Hubei, for example, qualifying small-scale value-added taxpayers were given tax breaks from March to May, and then to the end of 2020. Landlords who had provided rent relief to SMEs during the pandemic are eligible for a reduction in property and land use taxes according to the amount of the rent relief. The policies have helped some SMEs recover. Ma Xinhui owns the second-largest chicken farm in Wuhan’s suburban Xinzhou District, and chairs the Xinzhou Poultry Industry Association. Due to road closures, many farms in Xinzhou experienced feed shortages and sales difficulties during the lockdown — though Ma’s own farm received logistical help from volunteers and the government. After the lockdown, the Xinzhou Poultry Industry Association has actively helped its members obtain guarantees from the government-owned Hubei Agricultural Credit Guarantee Co. Ma’s own company was also granted an interest-free loan. “The industry’s depression is nationwide this year,” he says, “but the policies of Hubei province and Wuhan City have helped us a lot.” The tax break expired in December, however, and no new extension has been announced, something Luo thinks the government ought to consider. She thinks the Hubei and Wuhan governments might be short on money themselves. Provincial revenues through November were 25.8% lower than the previous year, official figures show.  The policies didn’t benefit every company, either. Cheng is the co-founder of a Wuhan public relations agency, a subsidiary of a company group headquartered in Beijing. Cheng, who did not want to use his own given name and the name of his company because he commented on the business conditions of his clients, says his agency is not eligible for the VAT relief because it does not qualify as a small-scale VAT payer, nor does it qualify for loan support. With 20 employees and average annual revenue of 8 million yuan, Cheng’s company mainly provides marketing and media services for listed corporations. Unlike more traditional businesses, Cheng’s suffered little during the lockdown. “When the staff were working from home, our work efficiency was not compromised,” he says. Clients sign annual contracts.  Still, the company encountered a decline in revenue as the hardship slowly made its way along the value chain. Some of Cheng’s clients were forced to cut costs. As a result, around one-fifth of Cheng’s clients decided not to renew their contracts for the year to come. “Although we managed not to collapse this year, the next year will be harder,” Cheng says. “The transmission of these impacts takes time.” Despite the challenges, Luo also sees signs for optimism. Data from the local Administration for Market Regulation indicates that the number of registered companies in Wuhan has increased by 5% year-over-year as of August, she says. Although there may well be defunct companies that have not been deregistered, Luo thinks that at least it is a good sign that many new companies are apparently being set up. “The economy surprised me with its resilience,” she says. “It means that many business owners in Wuhan are trying hard to get through this tough period, rather than giving up right away.” Chen, who sells agricultural products, is busy preparing for the peak season before Lunar New Year. Her company recently started a business processing cooked food and is trying to expand its sales through online channels. Having lived through the initial outbreak and its many tragedies, she is slightly worried about the virus resurging in Wuhan. But she’s confident it wouldn’t be as catastrophic as last year.  “People are taking better precautions now,” Chen says. “I am also confident that the government will be able to respond to emergent situations better.”  Cui expects the restaurant industry and his own business will face at least one more tough year. But he’s not close to giving up. “We still have some foundation. The business is relying on delivery orders now — we will continue to do that, and see how it goes in one or two years,” Cui says. “I’ve been running it for 14 years. I treat it like my own child,” he says. “If your child is ill, or even disabled, you don’t abandon him.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006678
Hebei Goes Into ‘Wartime Mode’ Over a Few Dozen COVID-19 Cases,"Shijiazhuang, capital of the northern Chinese province, began a citywide testing campaign of its 11 million residents this week.",2021-01-06,"A northern province of 75 million people went into “wartime mode” Tuesday in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases, a sign of Chinese authorities’ continued cautious approach to managing the coronavirus. Hebei reported 19 “confirmed” cases — patients showing symptoms — and 40 asymptomatic cases from Saturday to Monday, according to local media. On Tuesday, the province, which borders megacities Beijing and Tianjin, reported another 20 confirmed cases — all but one in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital — as well as 43 asymptomatic cases. Experts from the country’s top public health authorities, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Health Commission, have arrived in Shijiazhuang and Xingtai, a nearby city, to help stamp out local outbreaks, Feng Zijian, a deputy director of Chinese CDC, said during an interview Tuesday with state broadcaster CCTV. According to Feng, the confirmed cases in Hebei involve a viral variant from overseas, likely from Europe. Shijiazhuang is beginning a citywide nucleic acid testing campaign on Wednesday, a local government spokesperson said during a news conference. All kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools in Shijiazhuang have been ordered to stop holding on-site classes, and the city’s railway station will suspend operations for at least the next 10 days, a policy that could affect residents’ travel plans over the Spring Festival holiday season. Nationally, China reported 32 new confirmed cases Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission. Twenty-three of these cases were locally transmitted, mostly in Hebei, while the remaining nine were imported from abroad.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006674
The Plight of Wuhan’s Forgotten COVID-19 ‘Long-Haulers’,"As 2021 begins, China is trying to move on from the coronavirus. But in the city where the outbreak began, some patients remain extremely sick — and uncertain how they’ll pay their growing medical bills.",2021-01-05,"Lin Qing has the same dream almost every night: Her husband is trying to disconnect his feeding tube again, and she’s struggling to stop him. Each time, the 65-year-old will wake up, her back drenched in sweat. Then, she’ll look over at her partner lying in his hospital bed, to make sure her feverish visions weren’t in fact real. As 2021 begins, many in China are moving on from the pandemic. Despite sporadic localized outbreaks, lockdowns are now a distant memory for most of the country, and the government has already begun drawing a line under the crisis — honoring its coronavirus “martyrs” and setting up special exhibitions to memorialize its response. Yet for Lin and others in Wuhan, the city where the epidemic began, the COVID-19 nightmare is far from over.  Nearly 12 months after they were first infected, Lin and her husband remain stuck in a hospital ward. Though she only had mild symptoms, he is still struggling to recover from the severe brain damage he suffered during the disease’s acute phase. Even now, the 70-year-old requires intensive treatment and round-the-clock care. The stress has pushed his wife to the brink of despair. “Both my heart and body feel exhausted,” says Lin, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy. “Sometimes I’ve even thought, if the window in this room opened a little bit wider, I’d jump from it.” Lin’s husband is part of an overlooked group in China — COVID-19 “long-haulers” whose suffering has continued long after they’ve been declared virus-free. Long-haulers are struggling to gain recognition in countries around the world, but in China — where the pandemic was suppressed early and media have emphasized stories celebrating the country’s success — they’re increasingly fading from the public consciousness. Shortly after emerging from its 76-day lockdown in April, Wuhan closed its emergency hospitals and declared it had zero remaining COVID-19 patients. In the months since, official data on the number of people still suffering from health problems caused by the coronavirus in China hasn’t been released. When asked how many long-haulers remain in Wuhan, the city’s health commission declined to comment. Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, which operates a special outpatient department for recovered COVID-19 patients, didn’t respond to Sixth Tone’s interview request by time of publication. The lack of official recognition has left families like Lin’s feeling isolated and afraid for the future. Many are worried they’ll be financially crippled by their mounting medical bills, as it’s still unclear to what extent government promises to cover COVID-19 patients’ treatment will apply to long-haulers.  Lin never imagined it would come to this. This time last year, she and her husband were enjoying the quiet life of a retired couple in Wuhan, tending to their garden, caring for their dog, and helping their granddaughter with her homework. In the evenings, Lin would cook dinner, while her husband played the piano. But then, on Jan. 25, 2020, Lin’s husband suddenly passed out in the kitchen. “I was on the living room sofa reading messages about the outbreak of the ‘new pneumonia’ when suddenly I heard him saying ‘oh, no!’” Lin told Sixth Tone in a previous interview in March. From that moment, the couple entered a surreal new world, as it became clear that both of them had contracted the mysterious new virus sweeping through the central Chinese city. With China scrambling to contain the growing epidemic, the couple was separated and sent to different hospitals for treatment. They wouldn’t see each other again for four months, with Lin’s husband transferred between several intensive care units as his condition worsened. For weeks, Lin’s only connection with her husband was the 4 p.m. phone call she received from the hospital each day, updating her on his situation. If the staff called late, every minute spent waiting was torture. In desperation, Lin’s family took to standing outside the hospital and staring up at the buildings, trying to guess which one her husband was inside. Sometimes, they even flew a drone around the complex, hoping it might capture a photo of him. By the time Lin’s husband was finally discharged from the ICU in June, China had successfully contained the outbreak within its borders — after nearly 4,700 deaths, according to official figures. Life in most cities was already returning to something resembling normality.  When the couple was reunited, however, it was clear their lives would never be the same. The disease had taken a terrible toll on Lin’s husband. Brain damage had left him unable to move or speak, and he relied on an oxygen supply and feeding tube to survive. The ordeal, meanwhile, appeared to have worn down his will to carry on. Though initially overjoyed to see Lin, he quickly became listless and resistant to further treatment. “At first, he was so excited and happy to see me and our daughter, but those positive emotions didn’t last long,” says Lin. “Though he couldn’t say a word, we guessed he had suffered too much. He had struggled to survive to meet us, he’d fulfilled his last wish, and he was tired of living.” But Lin refuses to give up. For the past six months, she has been taking care of her husband in the recovery unit where he was moved after leaving the ICU. For the retiree, coping with the physical demands of being a carer has been tough, especially as she only recently recovered from COVID-19 herself. But she has diligently learned how to turn her husband over, clean his waste, and remove the phlegm that occasionally emits from the tube inserted through an incision in his neck. “At least I can see him every day,” Lin says.  Though the nurses have advised Lin to restrain her husband’s left hand — the only part of his body he’s now able to move — in case he hurts himself, she says she can’t bear to do it. Instead, she watches him closely all day and encourages him to be more patient and positive. “I still need to get some rest at night, but I’ll immediately wake up if I hear anything strange,” Lin says. “Each time, I’ll always find that he’s removed the quilt and that his left hand is on one of the tubes.” It’s still unclear to what extent Lin’s husband can recover. He has received physical therapy to help him regain his power of speech and limb usage. Though these courses can be agonizing, Lin says she’s doing her best to stay positive. “When his condition gets better, I feel relieved,” she says. “But when it gets worse, I get sad.” There are some signs of progress. Lin’s husband can now sit for several hours with his blood oxygen level remaining normal. When he was finally able to sit in a wheelchair, Lin ordered him a new T-shirt and pants, and adjusted them using a needle and thread to make them easier to wear. “He has his pride. I can’t let him go around naked,” Lin says. These gains, however, have come at a crippling financial cost. Lin’s family already has a hospital bill of 300,000 yuan ($46,500), and that figure doesn’t include the many extra expenses associated with her husband’s treatment.  After exhausting herself trying to provide full-time care for 20 days, Lin was eventually forced to hire a nursing assistant, who charges over 200 yuan per day. She also has to buy her husband protein powder and other dietary supplements to aid his recovery. Several months ago, Lin sold the house where her husband grew up to help pay for his treatment. Other relatives of long-haulers in Wuhan are facing similar difficulties. Wang Yingying, 36, says her father is still hospitalized months after being reclassified as a “recovered” COVID-19 patient, as he’s still suffering from a pulmonary infection.  “For most families, the pandemic ended when the lockdown was lifted,” says Wang, whose name has also been changed for privacy reasons. “But for my family, it’s still ongoing.” Wang says she has no idea how she’ll pay for her father’s hospital fees. She settled an initial 40,000 yuan bill in April, but five months later the hospital began pushing her to pay off the much larger costs of her father’s recovery treatment, as the 63-year-old’s roughly 500,000 yuan annual medical insurance quota had already maxed out. Doctors have told Wang to check the exact amount she owes on the hospital’s self-service machines, but she can’t bring herself to do it. She knows it will likely be at least 200,000 yuan — more money than her family earns in a year. “Even now, I still don’t dare check the number,” says Wang. “The government expended so much effort to bring my father back from hell. But now, it (the recovery fee) has become so huge, I will never be able to pay it.” It’s still unclear whether the government will provide aid to long-haul COVID-19 patients like Wang’s father. During the height of the epidemic, China covered the treatment costs of all confirmed coronavirus patients, spending over 1.4 billion yuan by April. The medical insurance system provided two-thirds of that amount. Then, in June, Tong Zhaohui, a senior disease control expert, said in an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television that patients wouldn’t need to pay for their recovery treatment, remarks that quickly went viral. Yet patients are still waiting for details on how the government will handle recovery treatment payments. Early signs indicate that long-haulers waiting for large reimbursements will be disappointed.  An official at a local health care security administration in Wuhan tells Sixth Tone that once patients test negative for COVID-19, the government’s coverage of treatment costs comes to an end. As there is no set definition of the sequelae — or health conditions caused by — COVID-19, patients’ medical costs are dealt with according to the regular rules defined by national and local medical insurance systems. “There still isn’t a clear standard for the sequelae of COVID-19,” says the official. “Such a specific standard requires a long-term tracking process.” For Wang, this uncertainty only adds to her stress. She tells Sixth Tone she has often felt so overwhelmed, she can’t even bear to read her father’s text messages. “Despite the pulmonary infection, he can communicate with me, and he has a strong will to survive,” she says. “I’m under such huge psychological pressure.”  In other cases, medical staff are helping to pay for their own patients’ treatment, as their families are unable to keep up with hospital payments. Lin says another COVID-19 patient moved into her ward during the summer. Despite the fact the woman’s husband had already died from the virus, her daughter rarely visited her in the hospital. She had taken on extra work in an attempt to pay off the treatment and nursing bills. “Fortunately, the hospital didn’t stop treating her, even though she hadn’t paid the fees,” Lin recalls. In the end, the doctors and nurses donated money to buy the woman protein powder and other daily supplies, she adds. In November, the ward also gathered to celebrate the 70th birthday of Lin’s husband. The moment she woke up that morning, Lin recalls going over to his bed and whispering in his ear: “Today is your birthday, and I wish you won’t be tortured by this illness anymore.” Her husband blinked his eyes in response, and the couple cried together in silence.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006666
Beijing Institutes 21-Day Quarantine Policy Over Coronavirus Scare,Some people in China reportedly did not develop COVID-19 symptoms for weeks after being exposed to the virus.,2021-01-05,"Amid rising concerns about longer incubation periods for COVID-19, Beijing has announced an extended quarantine period for inbound travelers. At a press conference Tuesday, city officials said people entering the Chinese capital from abroad must quarantine for 21 days — seven days longer than the city’s previous policy. While the first 14 days must be spent at a government-designated facility, the remaining week can be completed at a private residence with approval from local authorities. Xu Hejian, deputy director of Beijing’s publicity department, said some newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients had experienced longer incubation periods, as they tested positive for the first time more than 14 days after being exposed to the virus. This development, he added, had prompted city authorities to implement stricter quarantine measures in a bid to prevent future outbreaks. The announcement came days after China on Thursday approved its first COVID-19 vaccine, developed by domestic pharmaceutical company Sinopharm. In the following two days, more than 73,000 people in Beijing — including elderly residents and frontline medical workers — were inoculated. During a separate press conference Monday, Xu said the city’s mobile health app has also been updated to display users’ nucleic acid test results and vaccination status. Those who have received the injection will have their information updated on the app, though it’s unclear if a record of vaccination will confer additional privileges. On Monday, 33 new “confirmed” — or symptomatic — cases were reported on the Chinese mainland, around half of them locally transmitted, according to the country’s top health authority. Fourteen of the 33 cases were reported in the northern Hebei province, two in the northeastern Liaoning province, and one in Beijing. Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital of Hebei, went into “wartime mode” Monday after the city reported 11 cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006667
China Reports First Case of New COVID-19 Variant,"The patient tested positive for the highly infectious new coronavirus strain after returning from the U.K., but was immediately quarantined.",2021-01-01,"China has reported the first known case of the more contagious strain of COVID-19 that originally began circulating in the United Kingdom, though the patient has been under quarantine since she arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago. Researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday in a weekly report that the new variant of the novel coronavirus was detected in a 23-year-old student who flew to Shanghai from the U.K. on Dec. 14. The patient was taken to a quarantine facility immediately after she stepped off the plane, a measure China has imposed on all inbound international passengers regardless of their COVID-19 status during the pandemic. The woman, diagnosed as a mild case as of Wednesday, has not been out and about in the city, according to the report. On Dec. 24, laboratory work confirmed that the coronavirus strain contracted by the student was the new variant, known as B.1.1.7. The new strain carries genetic mutations that could make the virus 70% more contagious than other known strains. The B.1.1.7 outbreak forced the U.K. government to impose stricter lockdown measures on London and other cities in southeastern England before Christmas Day, with several countries responding by banning travel from the U.K. Despite these measures, more than a dozen countries have since reported patients being infected by the new variant. So far, there is no evidence that the new COVID-19 variant causes more severe symptoms, or that it can evade current vaccines. The patient in China tested negative for the virus two days before her departure from the U.K, the report said. She told health officials she was unsure how she had been infected, but noted that she had recently gone running without wearing a mask and had also removed her mask to eat and drink while waiting to board her flight from the U.K. According to the report, Shanghai authorities have undertaken several control measures, including contact tracing and disinfection. So far, authorities have not reported other connected cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006654
China Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine,The domestically developed Sinopharm vaccine is said to have a 79.34% effectiveness in preventing the disease.,2020-12-31,"China’s drug regulator has granted conditional approval to the country’s first COVID-19 vaccine, developed by a domestic pharmaceutical company, after its manufacturer said the shot had a 79.34% effectiveness in preventing the disease. Chen Shifei, deputy head of China’s National Medical Products Administration on Thursday announced the approval of the vaccine from Sinopharm during a press conference in Beijing. Officials said Sinopharm’s vaccine has shown effectiveness that meets the standards set by the World Health Organization and the country’s medical product regulator. Vaccinations will be free for citizens, according to Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commision. The approval is currently conditional, meaning that though the vaccine has not yet completed the large-scale human trials needed for licensure during normal circumstances, it can still be approved for handling “major emergent public health events,” such as the COVID-19 pandemic, according to China’s latest drug regulations. The drug maker can apply for a full approval after the trials are completed. Dubbed BBIBP-CorV, the vaccine is said to have presented “good security,” though the company hasn’t released any detailed data. It is the first inactive COVID-19 vaccine approved worldwide, made with relatively conventional technology relying on a “dead” virus to build immunity. Before China, the Sinopharm vaccine was approved in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain earlier this month. Large-scale human trials are still ongoing in both countries. Months before the approval, China had already been giving the vaccine under its emergency use program to high-risk groups, such as frontline medical personnel and cold chain logistics workers. Some students intending to study abroad have also received the shot, according to several people Sixth Tone spoke with. In addition to Sinopharm, the COVID-19 vaccine from another Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac is said to be showing promising results. Last week, Turkish health officials said the vaccine was found to be 91.25% effective in preventing the disease, though the report is based on only a small number of trial participants from a larger pool. On Wednesday, Turkey received its first shipment of 3 million Sinovac vaccines, and inoculations are likely to start after completing testing in the next 14 days, according to Reuters.

Window Into Wuhan’s Wards: A Nurse’s Video Diary,"For more than three months, she documented life, and love, inside her hospital.",2020-12-30,"HUBEI, Central China — Nurse Hu Xuejun will never forget the day Wuhan, then the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, went into lockdown. It was Jan. 23, and she reported for work at Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. That day was also her 27th birthday, and her 17th day on the front lines in the fight against the new coronavirus. “At that time, there was little information out there about this virus,” Hu tells Sixth Tone. “We didn’t know how contagious the virus was or how it spread. So we also felt somewhat anxious.” Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital specializes in treating infectious diseases and was among the first designated hospitals in the central city to receive COVID-19 patients. On Jan. 3, the hospital began upgrading its wards; four days later, it admitted its first coronavirus patient. Hu couldn’t have known then, but about a month later, her boyfriend Xia Hao, a funeral worker, would also be admitted to her hospital. After 56 days, he was discharged and sent to a quarantine center on April 14. To help ease the stress at work, Hu decided to use her phone to film all she saw on the front lines in Wuhan. She spoke with patients and health care workers, documented her boyfriend’s battle against the virus, and offered a glimpse into the hospital’s intensive care units. And she kept filming for over three months. “I shot videos because I wanted to remember it,” Hu says. “Filming helped me to cope with my anxiety.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006648
"China’s COVID-19 Vaccine About 79% Effective, Company Says","The Sinopharm vaccine is reportedly safe, though detailed data hasn’t been released yet.",2020-12-30,"The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm is said to have a 79.34% effectiveness in preventing the disease, according to an announcement Wednesday. The Beijing Biological Products Institute, a subsidiary of Sinopharm, said the vaccine that is still undergoing human trials presented “good security,” and the company has applied for licensing to the country’s National Medical Products Administration. However, detailed data has not been released. Sinopharm has been conducting large-scale human trials in countries that include the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Peru. In early December, UAE authorities said the vaccine, dubbed BBIBP-CorV, is 86% effective and officially approved it for use in the country.  The Sinopharm vaccine has been available for emergency use in China since July, together with another COVID-19 vaccine made by Beijing-based Sinovac. Last week, authorities in Turkey said the Sinovac vaccine was found to be 91.25% effective in preventing COVID-19, referring to a preliminary analysis based on a small pool of participants from a larger trial in the country. Both vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac are inactive, meaning they contain a “dead” strain of the virus that elicits an immune response. The technology is relatively conventional compared with the gene-based alternative used by two international COVID-19 vaccines: one by Germany’s BioNTech, another by U.S.-based Moderna. The BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, both announced with an efficacy of above 90%, contain only some of the virus’ genetic material, which helps speed up the manufacturing process. However, gene-based vaccines are more fragile and tend to require special facilities for storage. For example, the BioNTech vaccine has to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. Vaccines from both Sinopharm and Sinovac, meanwhile, can be stored at a normal refrigerator temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius, making them much easier to store and distribute. But despite a strong drive to make vaccines widely accessible, both companies have yet to conclude their large-scale trials around the world.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006647
Prominent Pianist Fou Ts’ong Dies From COVID-19,The musician — known as “China’s Chopin” — settled in the United Kingdom in the 1950s and had been returning home for concerts in his homeland.,2020-12-29,"Renowned pianist Fou Ts’ong has died from COVID-19 after battling the disease for two weeks, domestic media reported. He was 86. The Chinese-born British pianist died Monday local time in the United Kingdom, according to media reports. Fou was hospitalized for two weeks following the diagnosis. “Master Fou Ts’ong, a great artist whom I respected very much, may there be no illness in heaven,” wrote Chinese pianist Lang Lang, mourning Fou’s death.   Son of a notable translator and writer father, Fou was born in Shanghai in 1934 and went to study piano in Poland two decades later. In 1955, he won third place at the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, as well as the special “Mazurka Prize,” becoming the first Chinese musician to win prizes in an international piano competition. Fou settled in London in the late 1950s, often returning nearly two decades later to his homeland for concerts and lectures in cities including Shanghai and Beijing. In China, he is known as “China’s Piano Poet” and “China’s Chopin,” referring to legendary Polish pianist Frédéric Chopin. Zhu Hao, a Ph.D. candidate at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, remembers Fou’s visits to give master piano classes at his school during his undergraduate program between 2005 and 2009. “That was my first time meeting Mr. Fou,” he told Sixth Tone. “He’s very kind, after all. He is such a great pianist, but he doesn’t put on airs.” As a tribute to the piano master, Zhu also wrote a memorial note, recalling his monthlong classes wherein he would teach different themes, including the classics from Mozart, Chopin, and Debussy. The student also remembers Fou patiently combing through a Mozart concerto to help him understand its nuances in one of the classes. “The piano department then held a competition for students, and when each of us played onstage, Mr. Fou was too nervous to sit down but just peeked through the door backstage to listen to us play ... At the end of the competition, he was finally relieved and came onstage to congratulate us,” he wrote in a personal note shared with Sixth Tone. Following reports of Fou’s death, there has been an outpouring of fan tributes on microblogging platform Weibo, with some reminiscing about attending his concerts. “Having had the privilege of hearing Mr. Fou’s concerts twice, I remember his music as warm and philosophical, where he blended magnificent technique with the music itself,” read one comment under a related media post. “He truly took your breath away.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006642
"With Vaccines Still Unapproved, Chinese Cities Start COVID-19 Inoculation Drives","Shenzhen also includes people headed abroad for personal reasons, such as students, in its free coronavirus vaccination program.",2020-12-28,"Major Chinese cities over the weekend announced they would begin rolling out official COVID-19 inoculation campaigns for high-risk groups, even though domestic vaccines have yet to receive approval from health authorities. Shanghai, southern metropolis Shenzhen, and central city Zhengzhou all announced campaigns to inoculate people like frontline medical staff and cold chain logistics workers — vaccination drives larger in scope than those included in an emergency use program announced in July. The announcements follow comments by health officials during a Dec. 19 press conference indicating they would start vaccinating “key populations” at higher risk of contracting the virus. Shenzhen is so far the only major city to promise free vaccinations for people planning to go abroad for personal reasons, including international students. The latter group had thus far never been officially included in any preliminal vaccination drives despite arguably being at a high risk of exposure, as many of their destination countries still face ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Some students told Sixth Tone in October that they had succeeded in getting inoculated, either by pulling some strings with vaccine makers or via small-scale emergency use programs available at certain local clinics for about 200 yuan ($30) per shot. So far, no domestic vaccine has received full approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration. It is unclear whether China will provide the coronavirus vaccine for free to all residents once this happens. In October, the country’s health care administration said the total costs of inoculating “masses” of people with two doses each “obviously surpass what (public) medical insurance can afford” in response to such a proposal by a National People’s Congress representative. Potential funding for such vaccination drives is limited, partly because China’s public health system is separate from regular government-provided health care insurance. Currently, China’s public health system does not offer free inoculation for common vaccines such as those for influenza and HPV. Experts have estimated that some 75% to 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity,” a scenario wherein enough people have become resistant to the virus to make further outbreaks unlikely.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006635
"Chinese-Developed COVID-19 Vaccine Over 91% Effective, Turkey Says",Turkish officials say the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine is “likely to increase” as the trial continues to gather data.,2020-12-25,"A Chinese vaccine trial in Turkey has found to be 91.25% effective at preventing COVID-19 in a small pool of participants from a large-scale trial, Reuters reported Friday, citing Turkish health authorities.  The announcement is a boost of confidence for the Beijing-based vaccine manufacturer Sinovac after holding off on announcing the results from its trial in Brazil on Wednesday. Serhat Unal from the Turkish government’s COVID-19 advisory board said the efficacy was based on preliminary analysis of a small pool including 1,322 of the more than 7,000 participants from the local trial that began in September. Unal added the efficacy is “likely to increase” as the trial continues to gather data. “We are now certain that the vaccine is effective and safe (to use) on Turkish people,” Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said. On Wednesday, Brazillian researchers said Sinovac’s vaccine, dubbed CoronaVac, is more than 50% effective, citing a trial involving some 13,000 people. But the Chinese company has asked its Brazillian partner for an additional two weeks before announcing the exact number, so they can analyze data from other trials, including the one in Turkey, together. The Turkish announcement came five months after the Chinese government greenlighted the product for emergency use among high-risk groups such as frontline medical workers. Sinovac is the second Chinese vaccine that has been reported to be effective at preventing COVID-19 in trials abroad. Earlier this month, authorities in the United Arab Emirates said a vaccine made by Beijing-based Sinopharm is 86% effective in preventing COVID-19. The governments of the UAE and Bahrain have since approved the product. Both Sinopharm and Sinovac have not released detailed data from the trials.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006620
China’s Foreign Workers Are Celebrating the Holidays by Staying Put,"With the coronavirus still raging abroad, the usual family reunions around Christmas will just have to wait.",2020-12-25,"SHANGHAI — As 2020 draws to a close, many in China are already looking ahead to Spring Festival, the country’s weeklong national holiday, when families gather together for long-awaited reunions and sumptuous meals. After a turbulent 2020 full of tears and fears, the new year can’t come soon enough. Yet while the vast majority of Chinese will likely be able to reunite with their family members in two months, today, due to travel restrictions imposed alongside coronavirus outbreaks abroad, China’s foreign workers are missing out on seeing their loved ones at a time that to many is synonymous with kinship. In March, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the country would stop admitting foreigners, including those with valid visas or work permits, to reduce the risk of imported infections. In addition to keeping many people out, the policy also effectively barred foreigners working in the country from leaving if they also hoped to return. Although the suspension was lifted six months later, in September, China continues to require all travelers to quarantine for 14 days upon entry from abroad. While perhaps a necessary precaution, the policy nonetheless acts as a deterrent to those who had otherwise hoped to visit their families over the holidays.  Since early November, China’s embassies around the world have further tightened restrictions on travelers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other COVID-19 hot spots, adding a negative IgM antibody test as an entry requirement. Along with passengers needing a nucleic acid test administered within 48 hours of boarding, the new regulations have made international travel to the Chinese mainland a challenging affair. For Miriam Baumgart, a technical project manager at a major automobile company who has lived in China for four years, Christmas has a special significance among the major holidays, and this year’s is the first she has ever spent away from her family in Germany.  “The whole family always came together for Christmas, so it is quite weird now not to be there and to see everyone,” Baumgart told Sixth Tone. “Before, home was far away without feeling far away.” On top of the pandemic-related travel restrictions and a dearth of affordable flights, Baumgart was also worried about the possibility of exposing her loved ones — especially her parents — to the virus. “If you take everything into consideration, it was just too risky,” she said, adding that all of her friends, including some who had initially booked flights home, have ultimately decided to stay in China for the holiday season. Although Baumgart is grateful to be in a country where the risk of exposure to COVID-19 is relatively low, and where she is able to freely go out with her friends, she finds the chaotic situation in Germany “sad to watch” from so far away. “It’s heartbreaking to read the numbers from your home country, to see how things are devolving there, how the vaccine is still not being approved in Europe, and how up to 1,000 people are dying every day from this virus,” she said.  Similarly, Michele Atienza, a 43-year-old waitress at a Western restaurant, told Sixth Tone that she has been apart from her family in the Philippines for a year now. Though Atienza has lived and worked in China for over fifteen years, she doesn’t have any relatives in the country, so she typically returns home every year. “I was supposed to go back this past February, but all the flights were canceled,” she said with a tinge of regret. Last month, the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines announced that, due to the local outbreak situation, non-Chinese traveling from the Philippines to China would not be admitted, even with valid visas. Despite this news, Atienza is trying to stay optimistic about her situation and future outlook. “I’m planning to celebrate Christmas with my family through video calls — it’s almost like I’m with them, too,” she said, adding that she still hopes to visit the Philippines next year. Patti McAlpine, an English teacher at a Shanghai international high school, also scrapped her initial travel plans due to safety concerns related to outbreaks abroad. Normally, she spends Christmas with her family in Texas. Though she’s sorry there won’t be a big family reunion this year, McAlpine told Sixth Tone she feels “exceptionally lucky” to be able to spend Christmas with her cousins, who also live in China.  “Shanghai makes it easy to stay in the Christmas spirit, and that’s very welcoming for foreigners,” she said. While the pandemic has stymied her plans to return home, McAlpine says she has enjoyed the extra time to explore the city. “Almost all of the foreigners around me are making the best of being here,” she said.        For some foreign workers in China, the coronavirus-related travel restrictions were more than an inconvenience. “I was actually supposed to get married this year, and all my family were supposed to come to China,” said Mike, a 30-year-old business owner who has lived in the country for a decade. Now, instead of exchanging vows and jet-setting for an international honeymoon, Mike and his fiancée are planning to do a bit of holiday traveling within China. With a newly detected variant of COVID-19 that appears to be more contagious now circulating in the U.K., the virus is proving to be erratic and unpredictable, qualities Mike finds troubling. “The most common feeling I’ve been hearing from those around me is that of uncertainty — of not knowing when they’ll be able to go home, and not knowing when they’ll be able to see family,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006614
Dalian Limits Large Gatherings Over Rising COVID-19 Concerns,The city has six confirmed cases in addition to 20 asymptomatic infections.,2020-12-23,"The northeastern Chinese city of Dalian reported nine new local cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, with authorities canceling large gatherings and events to prevent further infections. In a statement Wednesday, the city’s disease prevention and control bureau said that only one of the nine has been listed as a confirmed patient. China only includes symptomatic patients as “confirmed cases” toward its national tally. The newly confirmed patient has been identified as a 58-year-old woman who became infected with the coronavirus after her asymptomatic daughter had previously tested positive, according to the statement. As of Wednesday, Dalian had six confirmed COVID-19 patients in addition to 20 asymptomatic cases. Amid the rising infections, Dalian authorities have ordered the cancellation of large-scale events organized by party officials and state-owned companies. In areas classified as middle- and high-risk, all commercial activities are being suspended. Over the past week, multiple Chinese provinces have reported new local COVID-19 cases, including one in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, six in Liaoning, where Dalian is located, and one in the southwestern Sichuan province. Dalian had previously reported a COVID-19 cluster in multiple areas of the city in July that was traced to a local seafood processing company. Last month, China tightened supervision of all imported cold-chain products after such goods were linked to several infections in recent months.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006617
China Strikes Deal to Buy 100 Million Doses of German COVID-19 Vaccine,Fosun Pharma has agreed to pay BioNTech a down payment of 250 million euros for its 95% effective coronavirus vaccine.,2020-12-17,"A Chinese pharmaceutical company has made a deal with a German partner to import 100 million doses of a cutting-edge COVID-19 vaccine that has already received full approval in some countries. Shanghai-based Fosun Pharma announced Wednesday that it had signed an agreement with Germany’s BioNTech to supply the Chinese mainland with its messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine beginning next year. In large-scale clinical trials involving over 43,000 participants from around the world, the vaccine, dubbed BNT162b2, was shown to be 95% effective in preventing COVID-19. While the American biotech giant Pfizer holds the right to commercialize BNT162b2 in most countries, Fosun is responsible for the vaccine’s approval and marketing on the Chinese mainland, as well as in Hong Kong and Macao. According to the agreement, BioNTech will deliver at least 100 million doses in 2021 after Chinese regulators grant their approval. BNT162b2 has only been undergoing small-scale human trials in China since August. However, domestic regulators can also accept data from larger trials conducted overseas when granting licenses — a condition put forward by the National Medical Products Administration in 2018 to fast-track key drug approvals. Whether Fosun has applied for BNT162b2’s approval remains unclear. Before the end of this year, Fosun will pay BioNTech 125 million euros ($153 million) as a down payment for the first 50 million doses of the vaccine, then 125 million euros more once the vaccine is approved for the Chinese mainland, the agreement said. It did not say how much Fosun will pay in total for the 100 million doses. The German company was among the global front-runners racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. In the past two weeks, the U.K. and the U.S. have granted emergency use authorizations for BNT162b2, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive the green light in the West. Some countries, including Canada and Bahrain, have already granted the product full approval. BNT162b2 isn’t just the first mRNA vaccine against the coronavirus to be heading to China — it’s also the first-ever mRNA vaccine to reach the global market. All of the three Chinese-developed candidates to receive emergency authorization in the country are inactive vaccines, an older method that relies on a “dead” version of the virus to elicit an immune response in humans. The mRNA vaccine, however, contains only a fragment of the virus’ genetic code, meaning many of the laborious steps required in the manufacture of conventional vaccines can be bypassed.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006595
City Rescinds Fines for Residents Who Bought COVID-Tainted Food,Members of 24 households in the Chinese city of Huanggang had purchased imported frozen pork tenderloin from a batch that tested positive for the coronavirus.,2020-12-12,"A city in central China’s Hubei province apologized Saturday for punitive action taken against at least two dozen people who had bought frozen meat products from imported stock that tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Residents from 24 households in Huanggang’s Huangzhou District had been fined 200 yuan ($30) each for purchasing frozen pork tenderloin through food-ordering platform Meituan Youxuan, domestic media reported Friday, citing a now-deleted statement from the provincial publicity department. The punishments were meted out after a sample of the pork products, which were imported from Brazil, returned a positive test for the COVID-19 virus. Following the announcement of the fines, many on Chinese social media objected to consumers — and not the companies procuring and selling the tainted goods — being held responsible. The fines were rescinded Saturday in response to “netizens’ concerns,” according to a notice from the Hubei provincial publicity department that cited district authorities. “We apologize for mishandling the case involving the 24 households and sincerely accept the public’s supervision,” the notice said. The earlier, deleted statement had said the fines were issued by the Huangzhou District public security bureau, which was also investigating Meituan Youxuan’s local partner that procured the products. It cited an earlier notice from the district epidemic prevention and control authority that called for prohibiting the “purchase, storage, and sale of imported frozen meat and seafood products.” The fined residents would also be required to pay for their own nucleic acid tests and quarantine at home, the statement had said. Saturday’s notice, however, vowed to provide free testing to anyone who might come into contact with cold-chain food products. Sixth Tone’s phone calls to the Huangzhou District public security bureau went unanswered Friday. Authorities in China have recently tightened rules on frozen food after a number of domestic COVID-19 clusters were linked to imported cold chain products. In October, authorities in Beijing announced that companies transporting or storing imported frozen food would be required to submit detailed information about the products via a government-backed online platform. And earlier this week, the eastern city of Hefei made real-name registration compulsory for anyone purchasing imported cold-chain food products.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006566
UAE Says Chinese-Developed COVID-19 Vaccine 86% Effective,Neither developer Sinopharm nor the Chinese government has publicly commented on the announcement.,2020-12-10,"The United Arab Emirates says a Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine that is currently undergoing human trials in the country is 86% effective in preventing infection. “The announcement is a significant vote of confidence by the UAE’s health authorities in the safety and efficacy of this vaccine,” the country’s Ministry of Health and Prevention said in a statement Wednesday. The announcement also conveyed the “official registration” of the vaccine — which uses an inactive form of the coronavirus — developed by Beijing-based drugmaker Sinopharm. The ministry said it had come to this decision after evaluating preliminary data from a late-stage clinical trial involving 31,000 human participants. The 86% effectiveness is the first such figure reported for a Chinese coronavirus vaccine after three Western-developed vaccines announced their efficacy rates in recent weeks. Two of them, both made with a different technology from Sinopharm’s vaccine, are reportedly at least 94% effective. Sinopharm had not commented on the UAE’s statement by time of publication Thursday afternoon, and no data from the trial has been released. However, a source close to Sinopharm told the Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, that the move “is a significant and very positive indicator of the vaccine’s effectiveness.” The UAE authorized Sinopharm’s vaccine for emergency use in September, about two months after the large-scale human trial kicked off in the country. Sinopharm is also conducting trials in several other countries including Peru, Morocco, and Egypt. Previously, Chinese media had reported that Sinopharm was seeking market approval in China, though neither the company nor domestic authorities have commented on the issue.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006560
"Chengdu Woman Bullied, Slut-Shamed After Contracting Coronavirus","The 20-year-old woman apologized, saying she hadn’t known her grandmother was sick before going out with friends — but many who have come to her defense insist she did nothing wrong.",2020-12-09,"A woman who recently tested positive for COVID-19 in the southwestern city of Chengdu has been targeted with relentless insults and trolling after her personal details were leaked online. Many social media users slammed the woman, surnamed Zhao, for visiting multiple nightlife venues, arguing this may have led to her spreading the virus. Before testing positive Monday, the woman had visited a nail salon, a restaurant, three clubs, and a bar within a two-week period, according to information the authorities released for contact-tracing purposes. “Her decadent lifestyle could cause a second wave of COVID-19 in Chengdu,” wrote one user on microblogging platform Weibo. Others slut-shamed Zhao, calling her “the queen of clubbing” and circulating what turned out to be a fake photo of her.  The 20-year-old was one of four new local coronavirus infections announced Monday by health authorities in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Both of her grandparents had tested positive for the virus the previous day. Zhao said she hadn’t been aware that her grandmother was infected and apologized to residents of Chengdu for “bringing trouble.” “I really don’t understand why so many people are attacking me,” Zhao wrote Tuesday on content-hosting platform Toutiao. “I just accidently contracted the coronavirus. I’m a victim, too.” Zhao has found some supporters online, who argue that she is being cyberbullied, and has done nothing that would warrant an apology. “The reason for disclosing the trajectory of the confirmed cases is to let the public know whether they should take a nucleic acid test, not to let you point fingers at other people’s lives,” wrote one Weibo user, alluding to the rampant discrimination faced by many COVID-19 patients during the early days of the pandemic. “Getting infected (with the coronavirus) is about chance, not about someone’s morality,” wrote Xianzi, a prominent women’s rights advocate who is currently suing veteran television host Zhu Jun in a landmark sexual harassment case. “Women’s personal lives and habits should not be judged by society.” On Tuesday, Chengdu police said they had identified a 24-year-old man who leaked Zhao’s full name, home address, and phone number on Weibo, and that he had received an unspecified “administrative punishment” for violating her privacy. On Monday, police had detained another man for five days after he “spread rumors” on social app WeChat about a possible citywide lockdown due to the local outbreak. As of Wednesday evening, there were 36 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chengdu.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006550
Inner Mongolia Reports 9 Coronavirus Infections,The cases were identified from a citywide testing campaign launched after two residents tested positive during a routine screening.,2020-11-26,"Update: Test results from the two initial cases have suggested that at least part of Manzhouli’s COVID-19 outbreak can be traced to Russia. By comparing genetic sequences from the infected couple to public databanks, official sources said the couple’s virus was “highly similar” to a strain circulating in Russia. A city in northern China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reported nine newly confirmed local COVID-19 infections Wednesday, bringing the total count for the region’s outbreak to 12 cases. The report followed Manzhouli, a small city administered by Hulun Buir, screening 203,326 residents after two tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. The initial infections were among a couple who had gone to a local hospital for the husband’s lower back and leg pain. They received a routine COVID-19 test and were both found to be infected with the virus. So far, authorities have not suggested how specifically the local cluster might have started. After identifying these two initial cases, the local government suspended all teaching activities in schools and child care centers the same day, also shutting down the train station. Several flights between Manzhouli and major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin have been canceled through Nov. 30. On Tuesday, Manzhouli temporarily suspended its local bus lines in a bid to “avoid transmission from people gathering,” according to the official government announcement. Located along the China-Russia border, Manzhouli is a major port of entry into China, and has thus continued to see imported COVID-19 cases over the past few months. In April, another so-called dry port along the China-Russia border — Suifenhe, in the northeastern Heilongjiang province — was the site of a major outbreak among Chinese nationals returning to the country through Russia. The city enforced a strict lockdown and set up a quarantine hospital over a few dozen infections.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006506
China’s Sinopharm Seeking Approval for COVID-19 Vaccine,"The company’s two coronavirus vaccine candidates have already been administered to over 1 million people, according to CEO Liu Jingzhen.",2020-11-25,"Sinopharm, a Chinese pharmaceutical company that claims to have inoculated over 1 million people with its experimental COVID-19 vaccines, has applied for a market approval, state-run media outlet Xinhua Finance reported Wednesday. The Beijing-based company has two vaccine candidates in late-stage human trials, and it’s unclear whether one or both has been submitted for approval. China’s National Medical Products Administration, the country’s regulatory body for pharmaceuticals, had not publicly commented by time of publication. According to domestic and international clinical trial registries, Sinopharm has not yet completed its stage 3 human trials, conducted in countries like Peru, Morocco, Egypt, Argentina, and the United Arab Emirates. Sinopharm also has not released any preliminary data from its stage 3 trials, although Chinese authorities authorized both experimental vaccines for emergency use in July. Liu Jingzhen, the company’s CEO, said nearly 1 million people have since been inoculated. “(We) have not received reports of a single case suffering a serious adverse event, only mild symptoms,” he told domestic media. In July, China’s National Medical Products Administration announced a new set of guidelines, aiming to fast-track drug review and approval processes. The regulation specifically said “breakthrough pharmaceuticals” and products that “prevent and treat major infectious diseases” would qualify for an expedited approval process, even if they had not completed late-stage human trials.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006500
"Maskless Man May Have Caused Tianjin Outbreak, Authorities Say",Experts say a recent COVID-19 cluster in the northern Chinese city underscores the role of face masks in curbing the spread of the contagious virus.,2020-11-25,"A man not wearing a face mask may have contributed to a community outbreak of COVID-19 involving eight people in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin, local health authorities said Tuesday. The man, surnamed Wang, was the first in the local cluster to test positive for the coronavirus on Nov. 10 during a routine screening, according to the authorities. The day before, the cold-chain worker had coughed and sneezed while not wearing a face mask in at least two different elevators in his residential community, potentially spreading the virus to others who later used them with their faces exposed. The results of the local investigation add to overwhelming evidence suggesting that face masks can reduce the risk of novel coronavirus transmission. “Scientific research, clinical practice, and years of experience all tell us that masks are effective (in providing protection),” Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone. While China’s health authorities mandated that people must wear masks in public at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year, public health messaging in parts of the West has been inconsistent. During the early stages of the pandemic, authorities such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not recommend wearing masks due to a lack of scientific evidence at the time that they could prevent COVID-19 transmission. As the virus has spread globally, however, a growing body of evidence now suggests that masks do reduce transmission. Multiple health authorities from across the world including the WHO have reversed their previous positions and now recommend universal mask-wearing in public. In particular, scientists have shown that face masks are effective in blocking the virus from entering the air in respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. They may also protect healthy people from being exposed to the virus to some degree. Blocking the source of infection has become an important factor in controlling COVID-19. Research has shown that people who become infected without developing symptoms could account for 17% of all patients, while some might only develop symptoms days after exposure. These two groups — the presymptomatic and asymptomatic — may contribute to half of all transmissions. “In reality, you don’t know who’s infected and who’s not,” Shen said. “So if all of us wear one (a face mask), we can protect ourselves and others.” He added that face masks are particularly important in confined environments with poor ventilation, such as elevators or cargo containers, which were recently linked to a small outbreak in Shanghai. The city with over 24 million people reported seven domestic cases over the past week, two of which were traced to a freight container from North America at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The local health authority said Monday that the two patients had cleaned the container without wearing masks. Winter and spring are the usual peak seasons for respiratory viruses, such as the coronavirus and influenza, because dry and cold air allows pathogens to spread more easily. While China’s coronavirus situation has been effectively brought under control, Shen said, the recent positive tests of imported cold-chain products and their handlers should serve as a warning. “There is a continuous risk of imported infections — not only human-to-human, but also object-to-human,” he said. “Keep a face mask on. Don’t take chances by thinking you won’t catch the virus.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006497
The Scramble to Rescue China’s Stranded Babies,"Many Chinese parents pay foreign surrogates to have their children. But with global travel networks severed, hundreds — and potentially thousands — of those infants are now trapped overseas.",2020-11-20,"When Zeng Yaqin received an instant message in May informing her that her daughter had been born, she felt a complex mix of emotions: elation, but also deep anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic was rampant, and she was stuck in her southern Chinese home — over 4,000 kilometers away from her baby in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The 27-year-old and her husband had turned to a surrogacy agency after they discovered Zeng had a congenital uterine condition that made her unable to conceive. In late 2019, the firm arranged for a Kazakh woman to act as a surrogate, with the couple paying 480,000 yuan ($73,000). But by the time the woman gave birth, global travel networks had broken down. Zeng found herself cut off from her child and unsure when she’d be able to see her. The agency moved the newborn to a villa in Almaty’s outskirts along with nine other Chinese surrogate babies, hiring local nannies to care for them. Six months later, Zeng’s daughter is still stranded overseas. The mother’s anxiety has become so intense, she’s suffering hair loss and insomnia. “I can’t concentrate on anything except studying the pandemic situation,” Zeng told Sixth Tone. “But what I read simply makes me even more upset.”  Zeng is far from alone. China’s ban on surrogacy — introduced over ethical and legal concerns — has fueled the growth of a sprawling global trade in assisted reproductive services over recent years. Agencies have sprung up offering to connect Chinese couples with surrogates all over the world, with Eastern Europe and the United States among the most popular destinations. It’s unclear exactly how many people in China use these services, but the potential demand is enormous. Infertility issues affect roughly one in eight Chinese couples, or around 50 million people. But the trade has descended into chaos in 2020, as global travel bans divided families and transformed Russian orphanages into “baby dens” housing dozens of stranded Chinese newborns. And though some countries have tentatively relaxed their border restrictions over recent months, hundreds — and possibly thousands — of infants remain marooned overseas. Chat groups containing thousands of parents of surrogate children have formed on Chinese social apps WeChat and QQ, where members exchange news on the latest visa policy updates, flight information, and coronavirus infection numbers. While some members have already managed to retrieve their children, many are still unable to do so. For Zeng, the past six months have been filled with maddening uncertainty. Soon after her daughter’s birth, the Guangzhou native heard from the Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan that negotiations over resuming flights between the two countries had already begun. Yet no such deal has been announced. When contacted by Sixth Tone, the Kazakh consulate in Shanghai confirmed there were no plans to restart flights between China and Kazakhstan in the near future. “There have been no notifications from related departments that direct flights will resume — at least, not this year,” a staff member at the consulate said.  It’s a situation Zeng and her husband never envisaged when they started researching surrogacy services in 2017. The couple considered finding a surrogate in the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. They eventually selected Kazakhstan, because it seemed the safest option. “First of all, the service is completely legal,” Zeng said. “The country is stable and has good relations with China. It has ideal medical resources and nice people.” After signing a contract with a small Chinese agency with connections in Kazakhstan, the couple flew to Almaty last July. There, they completed the necessary steps for the in vitro fertilization. They chose for the baby to be female. “As the fetus stabilized in the surrogate mother, I became more eager to meet my baby,” said Zeng. “It was meant to be the happiest year of my life, but it’s turned out to be incredibly stressful and challenging.” Now, Zeng’s only contact with her daughter is via the videos and photos of the infant she receives every day. The agency has arranged for five nannies to look after the 10 babies in the Almaty villa, which are overseen by two agency staff members. “It’s like a double guarantee,” said Zeng. The child care is costing the couple 6,000 yuan per month, though Zeng doesn’t care about the high expense. All she’s thinking about, she said, is getting to Kazakhstan as soon as possible. “As long as I can fly to Almaty, it won’t bother me if I get trapped there because of the pandemic,” she said.  Other parents, meanwhile, are frantically making arrangements to collect their children as countries ease visa and flight restrictions. Wen Xiaoqi, a 32-year-old from southern China, is currently preparing to fly to Ukraine. Her daughter was born in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital formerly known as Kiev, in late October. The Ukrainian government canceled a temporary ban on foreign visitors in mid-June — though the policy was briefly reinstated in late August — and the country has allowed Chinese citizens to visit for up to 30 days visa-free since Aug. 1. Many families have already taken advantage of these policy changes. One agency based in the eastern Fujian province — which claims to help around 300 couples find surrogates in Ukraine each year — said dozens of its clients had flown to the Eastern European nation since July. “Around 70 of our customers saw their babies stranded in Ukraine earlier this year,” a consultant at the company who declined to give her full name for privacy reasons, told Sixth Tone. “But most of them have managed to get them back.”  Wen hopes she’ll be able to fly in December. “What’s holding us up is the passport registration service for the baby at the Chinese embassy in Ukraine,” Wen told Sixth Tone. “The earliest reservations available are at the end of December.” At the moment, Wen’s baby is being kept at a hospital in Kyiv. A local nanny is caring for the child, at a cost of $70 per day. According to Wen, other parents with babies stranded in Ukraine have told her that if she doesn’t arrive in Ukraine soon, the baby is likely to be moved to a local postpartum care center that costs around 15,000 yuan a month. “To me, the cost isn’t a major concern now — I just can’t wait to see my child,” said Wen. “Other parents who already came back (from Ukraine) said they saw many families with newborns on their flights back to China.” Wen is worried, however, about the coronavirus situation in Ukraine. Thousands of new infections are being recorded in the country every day. “It seems the pandemic is getting worse there. I can’t sleep thinking about my own child being over there,” said Wen. “Only people like us, who have children stranded abroad, dare to board international flights right now. We’re risking our health for our children.”  Liu Xian, who is from the northern Shanxi province, is also awaiting clearance to travel abroad. Her baby was born in Moscow in June. Russia gradually began reopening its borders to foreign nationals in late July, and direct flights between the country and China restarted the same month. Liu’s surrogacy agency told her to begin preparing her application for a Russian medical visa in October, and she’s currently waiting for the visa to be processed. “In our chat group of nearly 400 people (with surrogate babies overseas), at least 30 of the members said their babies remained in Russia,” Liu told Sixth Tone. “Some are waiting for the visa, and others for flight tickets.” The 36-year-old said her agency had arranged for the baby to be kept in a rented apartment in Moscow. The child care fees are costing her family just under 20,000 yuan a month, Liu said. When Sixth Tone called Moscow-based surrogacy agency TDE Overseas posing as a potential client, the company’s founder said dozens of his Chinese clients had traveled to Russia to find their children over the past few months. “It takes up to two months to obtain a medical visa at the moment,” said the founder, surnamed Leng. “Most of the stranded babies under our care have returned to China. There’s still one baby stuck in Moscow because of the parents’ visa issues.”  Despite all the recent upheaval, Leng claimed his agency is still receiving new Chinese clients. Other foreign surrogacy agencies, however, told Sixth Tone their businesses had drastically declined, as parents turn to China’s domestic black market for assisted reproductive services amid the pandemic. The Ukrainian surrogacy consultant said the agency had worked with just over 20 Chinese couples in 2020, whereas it typically has around 300 clients per year. Qiu, manager of a Guangzhou-based agency, said he was now encouraging his clients to seek surrogates within China. Before the pandemic, his business mainly worked with surrogates in Georgia and Kazakhstan. “It’s more affordable to have a baby through surrogacy in those two countries. In Georgia, the whole process costs around 350,000 yuan, while the price is between 450,000 yuan and 480,000 yuan in Kazakhstan,” said Qiu, who declined to reveal his full name for privacy reasons. “Domestically, it costs around 550,000 yuan.”  Though surrogacy is illegal in China, many agencies like Qiu’s still offer domestic services, forming clandestine deals with local hospitals. If these arrangements are exposed, the companies and hospitals involved can face heavy fines, and doctors sometimes have their medical licenses revoked. The couples that pay for such services, however, are rarely punished. According to Qiu, demand for domestic surrogacy remains strong. “On average, we have between 150 and 160 babies born through surrogacy every year domestically,” he said. “It’s hard to calculate how many babies are delivered abroad, because we simply connect our clients with overseas agencies.”  Zeng, meanwhile, is taking heart from the recent promising results in the ongoing phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials in the U.S. The parents in her group chat are all hoping a vaccine will allow them to safely collect their children from coronavirus hot spots, she said. In some countries, direct flights from China aren’t currently available, but it’s possible to travel there via a complex series of connecting routes. Many Chinese parents, however, are reluctant to take this option, as they believe the chances of catching the virus are unacceptably high. For now, the parents must simply pray for a vaccine to be released soon, and for their children to remain healthy. “We parents all agree that we won’t risk our babies’ health because of the lack of direct flights,” said Zeng. “All we can do now is wait.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006460
China’s ‘Bat Woman’ Hits Back at Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories,"Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has explained — again — how her team visited caves in Yunnan and found hundreds of coronaviruses among the animals living there, some genetically similar to the COVID-19 virus.",2020-11-20,"In a rare move among the scientific community, China’s top virologist has issued a statement through a prestigious journal, hitting back at conspiracy theories claiming that the COVID-19 virus came from her laboratory. Shi Zhengli, an expert on bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in central China, on Tuesday published an addendum in Nature to her earlier paper on the novel coronavirus. The supplementary material described in layman’s terms how her lab obtained a bat coronavirus with a genetic sequence highly similar to that of the COVID-19 virus, and which has been the source of unfounded but persistent pandemic origin theories. In early February, when the world was still largely in the dark about the then-unknown virus that was infecting and killing thousands of people in China, Shi published research showing that the genome of the COVID-19 virus was over 96% similar to a coronavirus her lab had found in wild bats in 2013. The study provided initial clues about where the virus may have come from — bats — as well as how it might have become infectious to humans — because of mutations to a key protein. A deluge of conspiracy theories soon followed. Because Shi’s lab is located in the city where the first cases of COVID-19 were identified, rumors swirled that the institute had leaked the virus, or even purposefully designed it. Despite a lack of evidence, some of these theories received high-profile backing, including from U.S. President Donald Trump. Shi and her team have mostly eschewed the spotlight in the months since. However, in a February interview with domestic outlet Caixin, Shi said she had no control over what others say, and hoped an investigation by China’s “specialist departments” could “clear this up for us.” Then in a July email to Science magazine, she wrote, “Tracing the virus’s origins is a scientific question, which ought to be answered by scientists based on solid data and scientific evidence.” In Tuesday’s addendum, Shi said she and her team identified the earlier coronavirus, RaTG13, in bats living in and around a mining cave in the southwestern Yunnan province. During their many trips to the cave between 2012 and 2015, the team also identified another 292 coronaviruses among animals — bats, rats, and shrews — living in the area. Gao Feng, a virologist and professor emeritus at Duke University in the U.S., said he had hoped to see Shi release the genetic data for some of the other coronaviruses she and her team discovered. “That would have been more meaningful to the work of finding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he told Sixth Tone. “It’s unusual for a scientist to publish something like this — it’s not necessary,” Gao said, adding that, to Shi’s peers in the scientific community who are the main readers of Nature, most of the information in her addendum had already been stated. “I suppose they’re just trying to clear some things up.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006467
"Pandemic Could Last Through 2024, Chinese Model Suggests","With the coronavirus pandemic yet to reach its peak and vaccine production likely to be insufficient for months to come, it’s unrealistic to expect COVID-19 to be eradicated anytime soon, researchers say.",2020-11-11,"The world may have to endure another three years of intermittent lockdowns, breathing through face masks, and regular reminders to social distance, according to a new pandemic outcome simulation by a team of Chinese researchers. Scientists from Shanghai Normal University and Lanzhou University predicted that the pandemic has not yet reached a global peak, according to a report obtained by Sixth Tone. The number of infected would likely peak in March next year, with 80 million confirmed diagnoses and possibly several million more people untested. The COVID-19 virus’ high contagiousness and relatively low death rate means it would not simply disappear like its cousin the SARS virus did years ago, after spreading to over 30 countries and regions. Even if there’s a safe and effective vaccine rollout next year, the pandemic is likely to persist through the second half of 2024. There will be enormous demand to inoculate as many of the world’s 7.8 billion people as possible, and making headway will take time. The team’s attempt to simulate a global pandemic scenario is likely the first in China, Huang Jianping, an atmospheric scientist at Lanzhou University, told Sixth Tone. Other models, he added, tend to be national or regional in scope. Before COVID-19, Huang and his team specialized in climate-related simulations. “For weather forecasts, we always do models at the global scale, so we decided to accept the challenge (to simulate the pandemic),” he said. Huang’s model incorporates several climate factors — including temperature and humidity — that may impact the spread of the virus. Moreover, they used nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant emitted mainly by automobiles, as an indicator of lockdown strength across the globe. If people aren’t staying home even when orders to do so are in effect, local nitrogen dioxide levels are likely to be higher. While there are many approaches to predicting outcome scenarios, such as using disease data and climate models, only time can reveal the projection’s accuracy, Cheng Jin, a math professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. Cheng, who did not participate in Huang’s model, said pandemic simulations that account for vaccines may be less precise, because the current data about them — their effectiveness, duration of protection, and more — is lacking. “Of course, a simulation isn’t a crystal ball,” Wen Jiahong, the head of Shanghai Normal University’s disaster risk assessment center and a collaborator on Huang’s model, told Sixth Tone. “It’s unrealistic to expect simulated predictions to be extremely accurate, especially for things that are going to happen years in the future. A simulation shows a trend, where things are headed.” Cheng and his team in Shanghai have also attempted to project a global outcome scenario, but the lack of quarantine controls in some virus hotbeds like the U.S. and the U.K. has made predicting an endpoint almost impossible. Without effective measures to curb the spread, he said, the pandemic curve’s trajectory could spiral “out of control.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006428
China Dismisses Vaccine Concerns After Brazil Suspends Trial,"Brazilian authorities say the move wasn’t political, though a police report suggests the death of a study participant was a suicide.",2020-11-11,"Update: On Nov. 11 the Brazilian government resumed the human trial for the Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine, less than two days after suspending it following a “serious adverse event.” The country’s health regulator said it will continue to monitor the results of the ongoing investigation. After Brazil’s government suspended the clinical trial of a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine Monday following a “serious adverse event,” a police report obtained by Reuters suggested the event — the death of a trial participant — was a suicide. According to Reuters, local police are still investigating the incident, which occurred on Oct. 29. Sinovac, the Chinese vaccine maker involved, has been working with the Butantan Institute in Brazil since July to conduct a large-scale human trial of its COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac. The company’s spokesperson told Sixth Tone on Tuesday that the incident was not related to the trial, and Sinovac is “confident in the safety of the vaccine.” Dimas Covas, head of the Butantan Institute, said the trial’s suspension by Brazil’s health regulator had caused “indignation” and was ordered without input from the organizers, according to another Reuters report. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said during a press conference Tuesday that “Sinovac will continue to communicate with Brazil on this matter.” On Tuesday local time, the head of Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency denied that the trial’s suspension was political, saying it had been a “purely technical decision.” Sinovac’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine is one of 11 global candidates currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials. It is also one of three vaccines to have received emergency use authorization from the Chinese government.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006435
"‘Adverse Event’ During Brazil Trial Unrelated to Vaccine, Sinovac Says","Brazil suspended the clinical trial of a Chinese-developed coronavirus vaccine over potential health concerns, though the institute responsible remains confident in its safety.",2020-11-10,"This story has been updated to include comment from Sinovac. One of China’s most advanced COVID-19 vaccine trials was suspended by Brazilian health authorities Monday local time due to a “serious adverse event” in a human participant. Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency announced that it had “ruled to interrupt the clinical trial of the CoronaVac vaccine” after an incident occurred on Oct. 29. It has not given details on what happened, citing confidentiality protocol. CoronaVac, developed by Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac, is one of three Chinese coronavirus vaccines currently undergoing late-stage human trials. Since July, Sinovac has launched large-scale trials in several countries including Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. According to an international clinical trial registry, the experiment in Brazil had planned to recruit 13,060 participants. Chinese authorities approved CoronaVac for “emergency use” in July, mainly to protect the country’s high-risk groups, such as frontline medical workers. However, local health authorities in the eastern Zhejiang province also offered the experimental vaccine to residents, especially those with international travel plans. In a statement to Sixth Tone, Sinovac said that, according to the head of the Butantan Institute, the Brazilian research center conducting the trial, the serious adverse event was not related to the vaccine. “Sinovac will continue to communicate with Brazil on this matter,” the company said, adding that it is “confident in the safety of the vaccine.” This is the first time human trials for a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine have been suspended. Previously, an experimental vaccine by pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and a separate one from Johnson & Johnson were halted following “unexplained illnesses” in volunteers. Both trials resumed after investigations found no direct link between the incidents and the vaccine candidates. Last month, Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro said the central government would not buy CoronaVac. His remarks came a day after the country’s health minister announced that the Chinese-developed vaccine would be included under Brazil’s immunization program.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006425
China Tightens Rules on Frozen Food Imports Over COVID-19 Concerns,"All foreign cold chain products will be disinfected and tracked closely, as Chinese authorities trace more coronavirus infections to imported food.",2020-11-09,"Chinese authorities published plans to tighten supervision of all imported cold chain products Monday, after confirming another COVID-19 infection linked to packages of foreign food the same day. The infected individual, who showed no clinical symptoms, is a truck driver who tested positive for COVID-19 after loading packages of cold chain products in the northern port city of Tianjin. The driver was tested as part of a test-and-trace campaign, which authorities launched after two other northern Chinese cities — Dezhou and Taiyuan — identified live coronavirus on shipments of imported food. The packages — containing pork knuckle from Germany and fish from India — had both entered China via Tianjin, local officials confirmed Saturday. On Sunday, a worker at a cold storage facility in Tianjin also tested positive for COVID-19, Beijing Daily reported. The new document, published by the State Council, China’s Cabinet, aims to prevent similar cases arising in the future by strengthening requirements for disinfecting and tracking frozen food imports. According to the new guidelines, disinfection will need to be carried out before loading or transporting imported cold chain products. Details of all disinfection work — including the date, location, and product used — must be recorded and kept for at least two years. Packages that test positive for COVID-19, meanwhile, should be returned or destroyed, according to the document. All imported cold chain products must also obtain a disinfection certificate before being solid in markets. This isn’t the first time frozen food imports have raised concerns in China. In late October, officials in the coastal city of Qingdao said they had found evidence that coronavirus detected on shipments of imported cod was capable of infecting humans. China had previously found coronavirus on packages of foreign fish and seafood on multiple occasions. In late October, Beijing authorities announced that companies transporting or storing imported frozen food would be required to upload detailed information about the products through a government-supervised online platform starting this week.

Chinese Disease Expert Emphasizes ‘Vaccines and Solidarity’,Zhang Wenhong’s remarks came at the launch party of a new book about foreigners’ contributions to Shanghai’s battle against COVID-19.,2020-11-06,"SHANGHAI — As cities across Europe announce new lockdowns to combat an emerging COVID-19 “second wave,” Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong reiterated his prediction that the world won’t return to normal until sometime next year. “It’s hard to predict (when) at this point,” Zhang said at a seminar Friday in Shanghai. “The two things that matter most in this battle are a vaccine and solidarity: Countries around the world should pool all their resources together.” Over 100 representatives of Shanghai’s international community participated in the seminar, which marked the publication of a new book on foreigners’ contributions to the city’s epidemic control campaign. Titled “Friends in Need Are Friends Indeed,” the Chinese-language book collects 57 stories of non-Chinese who helped contain the spread of the virus in the first half of 2020. “I came here to say that international collaboration is vital in the battle against COVID-19,” Zhang emphasized. “And we’re keen on cooperating with other countries.”  Pudong New Area residents Lothar Sysk and his wife, Yu Lin, were among those featured in the book. At the peak of the outbreak in China, the couple worked as volunteers, checking the body temperatures of residents at their neighborhood’s gates. “I am really impressed by what other people had done,” Sysk told Sixth Tone. “My sister-in-law is an intensive care doctor in Wuhan. She worked day and night. My brother-in-law donated $2 million for masks and clothes to hospitals. I wanted to do something to say thank you to those people who keep me safe.” Another of the book’s subjects, Nepalese doctor Ashish Maskay, encouraged over 200 volunteers to donate blood through Bloodline, a nonprofit advocacy group he founded. “Blood is in really short supply (in China) because of the quarantine policies,” Maskay told Sixth Tone. “Just like what’s happening in the rest of the world.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006406
Shandong Prison Officials Charged With Negligence Over COVID-19 Cluster,Prosecutors argue the defendants’ mismanagement led to more than 200 people contracting the coronavirus at Rencheng Prison in February.,2020-11-06,"Three officials in the eastern Shandong province have been criminally charged for failing to prevent one of the earliest coronavirus outbreaks at a Chinese prison, local judicial authorities announced Wednesday. Liu Baoshan, former head of the Rencheng Prison; his deputy, Deng Tihe; and Wang Wenjie, former vice director of the provincial prison administration have all pleaded guilty to the charge of dereliction of duty. The courts in Jinan and Jining have not yet issued their verdicts. In February, 207 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported at Rencheng Prison. The same month, hundreds of inmates and guards in the central Hubei and eastern Zhejiang provinces also tested positive for the virus, raising concerns that prison environments were conducive to spreading the disease. According to the Shandong prosecutors, the three officials’ failures to properly carry out their duties had “led to the spread of the disease in Rencheng Prison, resulting in major harm to public property, the interests of the country, and its people.” Liu and Deng were accused of neglecting to monitor the health of staff members and inmates, as well as failing to control large gatherings in the prison. Wang’s case was heard by the Jinan Intermediate People’s Court, while Liu’s and Deng’s trials took place at the Jining Intermediate People’s Court. According to Zhao Chunyu, deputy head of the Beijing Lawyers Association’s criminal law committee, dereliction of duty occurs when a civil servant or other government employee causes unintended harm due to their own negligence. Under China’s Criminal Law, such individuals face up to three years in prison for most cases, or up to seven years for severe cases. “It is highly likely that the incident at Rencheng Prison will be deemed severe, given the harmful consequences of the spread of the disease, as well as the emergency situation it created and its effect on the public,” she told Sixth Tone.  But Song Lijun, a corrections officer-turned-academic specializing in prison studies, argued that the prison officials should not be held criminally liable for their mismanagement during the early stages of the epidemic, considering the complexity of prison work and the fact that, at the time, there was still much the country didn’t understand about the new disease. “We shouldn’t discriminate against prison officers,” Song told Sixth Tone. “If (government) officials in Wuhan were only dismissed, then prison officers should receive the same punishment. Officials should all be treated fairly, right?” On Wednesday, two more prison staff members — Chen Minhua and Dai Guanghui — also pleaded guilty at a Rencheng District court in Jining to disrupting disease prevention efforts. They are being charged with failing to truthfully disclose vital information. An official investigation concluded that Chen, a prison guard, had exposed others to the virus in late January, and had kept in close contact with dozens of inmates and his colleagues despite showing symptoms of COVID-19. Meanwhile, Dai did not disclose that his family had received a visitor from Wuhan — a city that was by that point under lockdown to contain its massive outbreak — to government contact-tracers. Both men ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 after infecting others. Zhao, the lawyer, said Chen and Dai would likely face up to three years’ imprisonment, depending on how directly their actions contributed to spreading the virus.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006396
"COVID Vaccines, Tests Take Center Stage at Shanghai Trade Expo",Several foreign and domestic companies are showcasing health care-related products and services that could help fight the coronavirus.,2020-11-05,"With the COVID-19 pandemic still spreading rapidly across the globe, several companies are showcasing their health care-related products and services at the third annual China International Import Expo (CIIE), which kicked off Thursday in Shanghai. Several global firms are expected to announce the latest developments in their COVID-19 vaccines, a major focus of the six-day expo, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. Companies are also exhibiting technologies that may help in the fight against the coronavirus, including noninvasive ventilators and new testing methods. Danaher Corporation, an American science and technology innovator, is exhibiting new virus-testing methods, including a nucleic acid test that’s able to deliver results in about 45 minutes. In addition, the company is showcasing a rapid molecular detection kit capable of providing qualitative test results in 36 minutes for the influenza A and B viruses as well as respiratory syncytial viruses. It will also help effectively differentiate non-COVID-19 patients with similar symptoms. The kit was granted emergency authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. Wang Lei, global executive vice president of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, said Thursday morning at CIIE that the company’s AZD1222 coronavirus vaccine will kick off phase I and II clinical trials in China by the end of this year, and AstraZeneca is expected to submit an application to get its vaccine on the market in China after completing phase III clinical trials abroad next year. AstraZeneca had signed a licensing agreement with Chinese vaccine manufacturer BioKangtai in August to promote the research and development, production, supply, and commercialization of AZD1222 in the Chinese market through technology transfer. AstraZeneca is partnering with Oxford University to produce AZD1222, and clinical trials are underway in several countries around the world. Though the trials were briefly paused in the United States and the United Kingdom following an adverse reaction in a volunteer, they have since resumed in both countries. According to the August agreement, BioKangtai will ensure that it can produce at least 100 million doses of the AZD1222 vaccine by the end of 2020, and expand this capacity to at least 200 million doses per year by the end of 2021 to meet demand on the Chinese mainland.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006399
China Bans Foreigners Traveling From Coronavirus-Plagued Countries,"The moves were announced Thursday by a dozen Chinese embassies in Europe, Asia, and Africa.",2020-11-05,"China has temporarily denied entry to most people traveling from a dozen countries, some currently seeing surges in local coronavirus infections. In the latest development, foreign nationals traveling from Russia, Ukraine, France, Italy, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and India will not be able to enter China, even if they hold valid visas. The statements, released Thursday local time, came hours after Chinese embassies in Belgium, the U.K., Bangladesh, and the Philippines issued similar notices. Chinese consular officials in these countries have also stopped issuing “certified health declaration forms,” a document required for all foreign nationals traveling to China. Unaffected by the temporary travel bans are Chinese citizens and foreigners holding diplomatic, service, courtesy, or flight crew visas, according to the announcements. China’s partial border closure follows new restrictions imposed by several countries grappling with a second wave of COVID-19 infections. In late October, Belgium made international headlines after doctors in the city of Liège who tested positive for the coronavirus without showing symptoms were asked to keep treating patients because of the dire local outbreak situation. The country now has the highest infection rate in Europe. The U.K., meanwhile, announced a monthlong lockdown Thursday after seeing its highest-ever daily death toll increase earlier this week. By contrast, most of the non-European countries on the list are not currently experiencing dramatic upticks in cases. According to reports this week from China’s Xinhua News Agency, the Philippines logged 987 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, its lowest daily figure since mid-July. And Bangladesh’s 1,517 new cases Wednesday are far below the country’s single-day peak of 4,019 infections in early July. To curb imported infections, China this week tightened controls for inbound travelers. From Monday, many if not all people traveling to China were required to present negative results for both nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests administered within 48 hours of boarding. The websites of the Chinese embassies noted that authorities will continue to make timely adjustments based on outbreak situations abroad. This story has been updated with new information.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006400
China Tightens Entry Requirements by Adding Second COVID-19 Test,Inbound passengers — whether all or only those from high-risk countries is unclear — must present negative nucleic acid and antibody tests taken within 48 hours of boarding.,2020-11-03,"International travel to the Chinese mainland has slowly resumed after a ban on most foreign nationals was imposed in March. Now, strict testing and quarantine measures are helping curb the risk of imported COVID-19 cases but also creating headaches for would-be returnees.  Starting this week, most if not all foreign and Chinese nationals flying into the country are required to present negative results for both nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests administered 48 hours before boarding. IgM is a type of protein the immune system produces to fight infections, and a negative IgM test result means an individual has either never been exposed to the COVID-19 virus or has recovered after being infected. According to Lu Hongzhou, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, it typically takes three to four weeks after infection before a recovered coronavirus patient tests negative for IgM antibodies. “The policy makes sense for the current situation,” Lu told Sixth Tone. “We need the IgM test, as there could be false negatives for the nucleic acid test.” Chinese experts have estimated false negative rates on nucleic acid tests to be anywhere from 20% to 50%. The new entry requirements were posted on the websites of Chinese embassies in countries reporting surging infection rates, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, India, and Nepal. It is unclear whether the rule applies to all incoming passengers or only those coming from or transiting through high-risk countries. Previously, China-bound passengers were only required to show a negative result for a nucleic acid test taken 72 hours before boarding, as well as submit to 14 days’ quarantine upon arriving in the country. According to the new announcements, inbound passengers should also apply for “certified health declaration forms” from their respective Chinese embassies after receiving their negative test results. Transiting through low-risk countries to skirt these requirements is not an option, as the rules apply to a passenger’s first port of departure. The stricter entry requirements are an inconvenience to some travelers, who argue that not all medical institutions are able to provide test results within 24 hours, especially if the local health system is overwhelmed by domestic cases. “It’s extremely inconvenient (to complete the required tests),” a student surnamed Wen in Australia told Sixth Tone. “I’m in Newcastle, around two or three hours’ drive from Sydney. My plane leaves Sunday, which means I have to do the test Friday and get the result Saturday — but that will be really difficult here.” Others, meanwhile, believe the 48-hour window, though tight, is workable. Under a related hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo, a user appearing to be a Chinese mother in the U.K. commented that she was successful in registering for the tests after explaining the new entry requirement to local medical institutions. “Although the time is quite tense, it’s still possible to manage,” she wrote. While many countries around the world are still struggling to contain COVID-19, China has largely brought the virus under control, apart from sporadic clusters that have been traced to new arrivals and imported seafood. On Monday, China’s National Health Commission reported 44 “confirmed” — or symptomatic — cases among newly arrived passengers, along with 48 asymptomatic imported cases. The country’s total number of confirmed cases stands at 86,070, while global infections exceed 46 million.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006379
"Bad COVID Tests, Troubling Chest Scans, and the Doctor Who Spoke Out","By pushing for coronavirus diagnoses based on CT scans of patients’ lungs, Zhang Xiaochun, at great risk, helped people get the care they needed.",2020-10-31,"This story is part of a weekend column featuring translations from respected Chinese media outlets, as selected and edited by Sixth Tone. All are reproduced with the outlets’ permission. A version of this article was first published in The Intellectual. HUBEI, Central China — A selection of gauze and N95 masks hang on the handle of the door to Dr. Zhang Xiaochun’s break room. Some are worn out, but most are spotless. “During the epidemic, I’d use hot water to wash and sterilize them so I could reuse them,” Zhang, 46, explains as she holds up one of her homemade gauze masks and recalls the lack of supplies in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. Soft-spoken, her words are terse and coherent — a far cry from the hot-blooded post she shared during those same early days on her messaging app WeChat feed, calling for a revolution in how COVID-19 cases are diagnosed. During the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in central Hubei’s Wuhan in January, many people suspected of being infected were unable to get this confirmed, either because they could not get access to a test, or because the results from the earliest and still relatively inaccurate nucleic acid tests came back negative. According to the fourth national diagnosis and treatment plan released on Jan. 27, “confirmed cases” needed a positive nucleic acid test or a viral gene-sequencing analysis that was highly homologous with 2019-nCoV. Meanwhile, people who merely showed symptoms, no matter how severe, could only be identified as “suspected cases,” meaning they could not get access to care. Even people with CT scans showing severe lesions on both lungs nevertheless tested negative and so had no option but to self-quarantine at home. Some even collapsed just after leaving the hospital.  Zhang, a radiologist and deputy head of the radiology department at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, received numerous requests for help. However, she was powerless: “It really hurt me.” During this time, Zhang spent her days and nights poring over CT scans. She discovered that patients who tested negative had lungs that looked much the same as those of patients who tested positive: They showed sites with white patches and pulmonary inflammation that developed in similar locations and developed in similar ways. She grew convinced CT imaging should be the primary basis for diagnosing COVID-19. She knew that this would help the large number of undiagnosed “suspected cases” receive access to treatment. However, there was a problem: How could she speak up loud enough for her message to be heard by the government, but not so loud that she would get herself and others into trouble? At around 10 a.m. Feb. 3, after a sleepless night spent editing a long WeChat post, Zhang finally hit “send.” Despite her plea for CT scan diagnoses only being up for 10 minutes, people had raced to forward it. The effect was like an earthquake, and just a day later, the fifth edition of the national diagnosis and treatment plan added a section on the “clinical diagnosis of cases.” On Feb. 12, clinically diagnosed cases were included in the case count for Hubei province. By pushing for diagnoses based on scans, Zhang was also a catalyst for getting people with mild symptoms into quarantine centers where they could be observed and receive treatment — and not risk infecting their family members, thus avoiding countless more infections. While people might know about Zhang’s heroic WeChat post, few know about the small tragedies that happened at around the same time in her private life. Since moving to Wuhan two years ago for work, Zhang and her husband have lived in separate cities, while her parents helped them take care of their daughter in Wuhan. Her parents went on to both get infected, with her father even being critically ill for a period. Although he eventually recovered, he is dealing with physical and psychological aftereffects. The frantic months put a strain on the household. “The epidemic is over, but my family is split apart,” Zhang explains on a Friday afternoon in August. Sitting at her desk — which is covered with flowers and photos of her daughter — she slowly recounts her story. Since the outbreak, she has experienced mild depression, finding that psychotherapy has had little effect on a doctor like herself. Now she mainly relies on self-treatment, such as by surrounding herself with photos of her daughter to lift her mood. Zhang tells The Intellectual she doesn’t consider her story to be unique, rather, she sees it as just one among millions of similar stories of medical workers. The interview below has been edited for brevity and clarity.  The Intellectual: When did you first come into contact with scans of COVID-19 patients? Zhang Xiaochun: The first time was around Dec. 27 or 28 (2019). At the time, I didn’t know it was a novel coronavirus. One evening after work, a colleague in my department asked me to look at a scan. My first thought was that it looked like SARS. I asked if SARS had returned, and they wanted to know why I’d say that. I explained that I’d been on the front lines back then and so I was familiar with it. I was joking at the time, because SARS hadn’t been around for years. Since different diseases can look the same in scans, one image can appear to be many different diseases. The manifestation of COVID-19 is similar to mycoplasma pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, some common viral pneumonias, and bird flu — they can all look the same. Plus, they also change depending on the time period. Identifying pathogens is not our (the radiology department’s) strong point. Clinical laboratory tests — in other words, nucleic acid tests — are required to identify the pathogen. The Intellectual: You called for CT scans to be used as evidence of COVID-19 infection on Feb. 3 in a post on WeChat. What was your experience between first seeing COVID-19 scans and publishing the post? Zhang: I first heard official news of the presence of an unexplained pneumonia on Dec. 31 (2019). That day I was supposed to be on annual leave and was preparing to travel with my parents and daughter to my hometown in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for (late January’s) Spring Festival. That morning around 9, the hospital called to say that something big had happened and that all leave for senior staff members was cancelled. So, I hurried back to work. When I arrived, we were told in a meeting that a pneumonia of unknown origin had appeared near the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. The directors and deputy directors of each department were told to quickly begin procuring protective materials. At the time, the hospital only had 50 N95 masks, while departments like ours didn’t have any surgical masks, let alone sterilizing materials.  I did all kinds of preparatory work. I asked the head nurse to get supplies and gather materials, and tasked the head technician with getting sterilization equipment. What can you do without a mask, though? Since I’d made masks when I was fighting SARS, I had some experience. So, I got the head nurse to collect gauze, and we made 12-layer masks. Just after 11:50 p.m. on Dec. 31, our department posted a series of (science-based) articles to WeChat. I reposted them on my feed. As soon as I did, however, I saw a notice online from the National Health Commission saying that no one may announce information without permission. I deleted the posts immediately, but not before some WeMedia platforms had already forwarded them. However, they didn’t reach many people and the hospital didn’t reprimand us. By around Jan. 14, things had become much more serious, and we were required to come to work more often. As such, I took to sleeping on the futon in the office, feeling that I had to devote myself fully to the task at hand. I got students to gather all the scans and reports of suspected cases to determine what characteristics they shared. On Jan. 20, the situation had become even more serious, and all students were told to leave Wuhan. Left on my own, I had to do the research myself, day and night. Around Jan. 23, before Spring Festival, the department tasked me with summarizing the characteristics of image detection during the occurrence and development of COVID-19 and then compiling a guide. During this period, I told our department director that I believed these patients were (infected with the virus). But, with no nucleic acid test information and no gold standard, this could not be confirmed. Without hard evidence, the guide we were putting together wouldn’t be rigorous. He understood and collected data about almost 100 positive nucleic acid tests from the hospital. I compared the nucleic acid results of confirmed cases and the corresponding scans. Placing them side by side, I found that there were cases with similar or the same CT scans who tested negative. Many others who were critically ill did not even have a test result. Many of my friends, some of whom are my fellow doctors and relatives of my friends, also had similar CT results but couldn’t get admitted to the hospital without a nucleic acid test. Back then, there was a limited number of test kits, their (detection) sensitivity was low, and people had to line up for a long time. I received multiple phone calls from people unable to gain admission to the hospital. Some people even died before they could be hospitalized and treated. I was really hurt by this. My parents also had CT scans on Jan. 31, and my mother’s nucleic acid test came back negative. On Feb. 2, I went and lined up at a quarantine site for my parents to register again for tests and scans. Someone behind me in the queue accidentally dropped a CT scan of a sick family member. From the corner of my eye, I spotted white patches on the image and told him that he didn’t need to queue or go to the clinic — he should go straight for hospitalization since it was already serious. He asked me who I was and what it had to do with me. Then he added it wasn’t possible to get into the hospital. Since I couldn’t say I was a doctor, I replied that my family was in the same situation and asked to take a look. When he heard that, he handed over the scan. I could see it was serious and asked why hospitalization wasn’t possible. When he explained that their nucleic acid tests were negative, I realized how serious things were. Looking again at the patient with his blank expression, it seemed like he wanted to die. I felt awful. I felt terrible driving back from that place. By then, Wuhan was already under lockdown. The roads were empty, but still I almost drove into the curb. I wanted to cry but no tears came out; I just didn’t have the strength. Instead, I pulled over to the side of the road and slumped over the steering wheel, the engine still running.  I tried to think about what I should do. There were so many patients, and my own family. My husband and I were living in separate cities, and I’d arrived in Wuhan just two years ago. When my parents left (to quarantine), there’d been no one to look after my 8-year-old daughter. She’d already been home alone the whole day. My parents were infected, so she might be too. I didn’t know what to do. I felt powerless and desperate. I calmed myself down and didn’t cry: I didn’t even have the courage to — all I could think was that I had to keep on going. On the way back, I called my daughter, but there was no answer. I felt more panic, but then I thought about it, gritted my teeth, and drove back to the hospital. Back at the hospital, I sorted out my work for the day, grabbed a couple of takeout meals, and drove home. When I got there, the room was pitch-black and completely quiet. My heart sank. As soon as I turned on the light, my daughter jumped up from the sofa where she’d been curled up and rushed toward me. I told her, in a really heartless way, to stay where she was and not come close. My daughter just stared at me, with her small hands outstretched awaiting a hug. “Don’t come close; your mom just came out of the infected area — stay where you are,” I told her. “Mom, I missed you. Granny and grandad aren’t here, and you won’t even let me hug you,” she replied. I said: “Your mom doesn’t know if she has the virus or not, so you need to stay away from me and spray some disinfectant. Let’s change the way we greet each other. No hugs when I come in. We’ll just hip-bump together.” My daughter made me some egg-fried rice. When she brought it to me, I could see she had a large blister on her hand. She’d even made a little red flag for me using some ribbon on which she’d written: “Stay strong Wuhan; stay strong Mom.” She’d never sewed before, but she’d sewed and written it herself. She asked me if I’d stay at home with her since she didn’t want to be alone. I told her I couldn’t and that I had to go to battle. She said, “Mom, you’re not a soldier anymore. You left the army.” I told her I’m a doctor, not a soldier, that there’d been a serious outbreak that was really bad, and grandpa and grandma were both ill. Then I asked if she thought her mom should go. She pouted and I told her she was a good girl. I told her to open WeChat and switch on her video chat with me through the computer and not to turn it off — I wouldn’t either. That way, she could still see me. I sorted things out for her there and then returned (to the hospital). By that time, it was already 1 a.m.  There was no way I could sleep that night. When I got back, there were a lot of messages on my phone all asking me to look at scans. Whenever I asked, there’d be no nucleic acid test information, and they weren’t able to be admitted to the hospital. I barely slept at all. Normally I’d take some cold medicine — one pill to help me nap for an hour or two. However, that day I took one and it made no difference. All I could think about was whether or not (I should post on WeChat). I really wanted to let the prevention and control headquarters know, but after trying (a web page), it kept saying that my ID number was wrong. There was no other way for me to let the higher-ups know. All I wanted to do was make this matter as widely known as possible; then the government would get this information. That night I edited, deleted, and reedited the post numerous times before deleting it around 5 a.m. I kept thinking whether or not I should say anything. I was weighing if it might cause panic and misunderstanding in the country’s fight against the virus. After all, we professionals always worry about that. Finally, I just had to do it. Around 9 a.m. I composed it again in a rush. Looking back, I feel like (at the time) I wrote it in a state of complete indignation, and then posted it. After posting, some people liked it, and I began to feel anxious. I commented that I didn’t want likes, just for people to help spread it — and quickly — because I had no other way to do so.  After I posted it, I received a call telling me to delete it. I decided to hold off for around 10 minutes to give some time (for people to repost it). Those 10 minutes were really useful. After I deleted it, I kind of buried my head in the sand, leaving my phone in the office and not looking at it. That way if anyone wanted to call or contact me then that’d be that. I put on my PPE (personal protective equipment) and went to work. When I returned in the afternoon and looked at my phone, I found it was inundated with messages. The Intellectual: On Feb. 5, the fifth version of the diagnosis and treatment plan was published, including clinical diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases in Hubei province (“suspected cases with scans showing characteristics of pneumonia”). By Feb. 12, clinically diagnosed cases were included in the case figures for Hubei province. Then on Feb. 19, the sixth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan removed the category “clinically diagnosed cases,” with those patients now counted with other “confirmed cases” instead. What was your experience being the one behind this and witnessing this process? And what did these changes show you? Zhang: For a while after posting, I felt really scared and panicky. When I first posted it, I didn’t feel that afraid. Later on, I received a string of phone calls with some people saying it had been ill-judged, and that speaking up in this way would cause problems not only for myself, but also for my bosses and the hospital. At the time, these words stuck with me. I couldn’t bear to think that it might drag in some innocent people — that’s why I deleted it from my feed. However, the fact that it attracted so much attention showed that it really was what everybody was focused on. It got straight to the heart of the problem that needed to be solved at the time. In fact, my post simply served to attract the attention of the government and the people. The Chinese government has a strong ability to respond, and senior policymakers want to hear real and solid suggestions. At the time, many representatives in Beijing from the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) contacted me and asked me to put my suggestions in writing. They submitted them for me, and (party newspaper) People’s Daily also submitted (my suggestions) in the form of an internal reference. It all happened very quickly. At around 3 a.m. on Feb. 4, I sent several voice messages to President Wang (Xinghuan, president of Zhongnan Hospital), concerned that my actions would affect the leadership. I just said, “President, I must have gotten you into some trouble. If you’re punished, I’ll take responsibility.” He quickly replied, saying: “We’re all busy and just had several meetings concerning exactly what you want. We’re organizing wide-scale quarantines, so don’t worry and get some rest.” I was so relieved. At a press conference held by the National Health Commission on Feb. 4, a reporter from the Economic Herald in Hong Kong asked a question about the matter. Li Xingwang, an expert from Ditan Hospital (in Beijing), responded by saying that scans had always been a standard for diagnosis. With that one sentence, that was that. When we heard those words, we knew that the matter was being dealt with. When the (fifth) diagnosis and treatment plan was made public on Feb 5., it had been incorporated. From my personal experience, in the face of a major disaster like this, our government urgently needs professional advice from every expert. Only those on the front lines have the right to speak.  The Intellectual: How can more professionals be encouraged to make suggestions and proposals? For example, not by posting on WeChat, but through more direct means. Zhang: Well, posting on WeChat really was an act of desperation. If someone wants to make a suggestion, who wouldn’t want to make it through the right channels? Since there’s no way to understand the big picture, people have no choice but to adopt this kind of relatively unreasonable method. In fact, we experts and professors are the least likely to post on social media, since we have a sense of social responsibility. We’re afraid of being misunderstood and misinterpreted. So, why not go through the hospital? The hospital is also in a difficult position. If you give it to them, they also don’t know who to pass it on to. The hospital’s managers aren’t (medical) professionals and lack understanding. As far as they’re concerned, they think, “What does it have to do with you?” Or they’ll say something like, “Dr. Zhang, you just stick to your scans. I didn’t receive any instructions from the leadership on how we should fight the epidemic.” The things they said made me realize there was no point in arguing. I hope such lack of professionality will become a thing of the past and that there will be smooth channels for expert advice, so this kind of thing won’t happen again. This may require improvements to the national disease prevention and control system or various departments. The country may need to think about how to open up expert channels, not just regarding epidemics, but also for incidents like fires and earthquakes. For example, professionals could be granted access according to their level or rank. Where does the saying “there are many experts among the people” come from? It’s because there’s still a certain discrepancy between macro planning and the actual situation. Therefore, voices from below can sometimes be the most practicable. This fact has been revealed by the epidemic. The Intellectual: You also took part in the fight against SARS 17 years ago, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. What have your experiences taught you? Zhang: SARS was more of a panic. At the time, I was a postgraduate student and also working as a surgeon. It felt like the world was coming to an end. After SARS, I thought about how useless panicking is. It just leads to more confusion, and outcomes only get worse. Afterward, I told myself that whenever something happens in the future, I’d calm down first and think carefully about how best to deal with it. There’s no problem that cannot be solved. The more panic there is, the greater the harm. I was also on the front lines for the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. At the time, I happened to be a resident doctor studying in western China. That day I was resting in my apartment on the 22nd floor when a little after 2 p.m. there was a big commotion, my vase smashed to pieces, and my lamp fell to the ground. My first reaction was that it was an earthquake. I rushed to the bathroom and wrapped my arms around the water pipe. Through the bathroom window I could see two tall buildings swaying from side to side. I counted more than 40 seconds before it stopped. Barefoot and wearing only my pajamas, I ran outside and then to the break room at the hospital to get some shoes. One of my classmates there kept saying to himself, “How could this happen? There’s never been an earthquake in Chengdu. What’s going on?” I told him to stop talking and go organize the teachers: “Everyone needs to head outside, just in case there are aftershocks. The computers also need moving out — put them out in the open, then fetch some tents from the hospital’s storeroom.” At that time, the radiology director came to me and said, “Zhang Xiaochun, you’ve worked hard today. You should organize the staff on duty.” I said, “Director, that’s a lot of work, I can’t do it alone. Please call all the staff back as soon as possible. Soon the wounded will start arriving.” He asked me why I’d say that, and I told him that mining accidents were a frequent occurrence in Inner Mongolia. At first he didn’t believe me, but he quickly (came around). Because of this experience and SARS, I was more sensitive than most to the outbreak. When major disasters occur, there’s always a lot of confusion early on, with people from all walks of life panicking. It’s not to say that the government is ineffective, but rather it doesn’t know what to do. That’s why it’s critical for us to reflect well and stay calm whenever anything happens in the future. Professionals should be contacted within the industries involved and an analysis of the situation should be made. It’s no use running around like headless chickens — a lack of order never helps anyone.  The Intellectual: You once wrote that you were fond of Winston Churchill’s line “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” What problems do you think the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered? How can we prevent this crisis from going to waste? Zhang: As human beings, we need to reflect after this crisis. Every person, every group, every organization — and even the government — should all reflect.  China is a huge country with 1.4 billion people. Despite such a large population and flow of people, we’ve been able to overcome the situation and control things well. We should reflect on why we’ve managed to do so. Individuals shouldn’t let this crisis go to waste, and the medical profession should consider why there were so many missteps in the first place. I can’t be the only one to have realized that. There are undoubtedly a lot of people who are more hard-working and smarter than me, but they didn’t speak up or act. Perhaps this is also something we need to think about. At that time, everyone might have had to discard some distractions — less thinking is more effective. This time I didn’t think too much. Plus, the government doesn’t want you thinking too much. When confronted directly by a disaster like this, instead of complaining, speculating, or keeping quiet to protect yourself, it’s better to propose solutions. The source can’t be controlled, but we can control which way it heads, right? So, I proposed my own approach. All industries and professions should do the same. The Intellectual: You mentioned the problems your family faced. What changes has the coronavirus brought to your life? Zhang: I can’t bear to look back; I don’t want to think about it. As a daughter, a mother, and a wife, I feel guilty. The epidemic is over, but my family is split apart. Some people have said that I fought for Hubei, but it’s actually my entire family that fought for Hubei. On Dec. 31, I told my parents that we had to stay in Wuhan. That day I was too busy to eat. I called my parents in the afternoon and told them there was a new infectious disease, that they couldn’t go back to Inner Mongolia, and that they should cancel their tickets for Jan. 4. They were really unhappy, saying “you doctors always get carried away.” They explained that there’d been no mention of it on the local news and asked what I was basing my claim on. I even phoned my uncle and asked him to try and persuade my parents to stay. I said that if it’s confirmed to be a new infectious disease, their return would bring a lot of trouble to the national prevention and control. Plus, their arrival in Inner Mongolia would also cause a lot of problems for the local area and our relatives. Finally, they relented and agreed to stay. After my father became infected, he was in a good condition for a while. However, one day he suddenly developed a high fever. The next day, he had a CT scan and the mild lesions in his lungs were discovered to have suddenly worsened. He was having difficulty breathing and couldn’t walk more than a few steps without having to stop and rest. At the time, my mom called me and said, for the sake of your mother, for the sake of both of us who’ve taken care of your daughter for so many years, please talk to the doctors and get your father treatment. She said they didn’t want to trouble me, but asked if I could just please talk to the head doctor. Her polite tone was so unfamiliar. As I listened, I felt terrible. If you can’t love your own parents, how can you love others or think for ordinary people?  Of course I love them. But in this situation, I couldn’t stop working for the good of society just because they’re on their own. At that time, Director Peng Zhiyong, Director Cheng Zhenshun, and Director Xia Jian from the emergency department helped me a lot. I called them the “three musketeers.” I said I’m putting my father in your hands, please do everything you can to help him — although I couldn’t ask them to promise he would get better. Otherwise, after the outbreak ended, I wouldn’t be able to go on. My father was admitted to the ICU and put on a ventilator three days later. His immune system was completely destroyed. It took some powerful drugs to pull him back from the brink, although he was left with some aftereffects. As a daughter, my behavior was absolutely unfilial. Although my parents were unwell, I was still taking part in the fight against the epidemic. Even when my dad was close to death, I left him there in the isolation ward. That’s why my parents are so cold to me. They think: You spent all your time and energy caring for the rest of society and saving others, and in the end, your father ended up in intensive care. When my parents talk about Wuhan now, the look on their face changes. They don’t watch TV anymore because the mere mention of the coronavirus brings the fear rushing back. Whenever they feel unwell at all, they immediately assume it is the aftereffects of the disease.  When I’ll return home (in Inner Mongolia, where her parents and daughter moved after Wuhan’s lockdown ended), they’ll allow me to pick up my daughter, but not to stay with them. I’m not allowed inside the house. My husband, although more supportive, has also complained that being separated put our whole family at risk. During this time, I did my job with integrity. Their sacrifices have been bigger than could be expected from ordinary citizens. That’s why I feel sorry for them. I’m not the only person in this situation: Thousands of medical workers — thousands of families in fact — have gone through similar experiences. The only difference, I think, is the degree. I have mild depression at the moment because I can’t stand the stress. Why do I have so many photos of my daughter (in my office)? Because seeing her gives me a reason to live. I think maybe time will help heal (the wounds). I want to give my parents some time, and also me, too. My daughter will turn 9 years old soon. In the future, I may have to spend more time with my family and not be apart from them for such a long time. The most important things to me now that the epidemic has passed are family, life, and peace.  The Intellectual: Is there anything else you’d like to add about your experience? Zhang: This was a people’s war, not just the work of medical personnel. The key was cooperation between people from all walks of life. We medical workers rushed to the front lines. But, if there weren’t so many volunteers helping us with such aspects as logistics, including solving difficulties regarding materials, could we have won the battle? Take Wuhan, for example. When the citywide lockdown was announced, people all stayed put at home. Everyone shared this kind of cohesion, public spirit, and sense of responsibility. That’s what I felt most deeply. This was the greatest strength in defeating the epidemic. I’ve taught a lot of classes on the subject of faith to high school and university students, and I tell them that whatever behavior you think of as heroic, including mine, is really just human nature. Don’t put people on a pedestal. When thousands of individuals come together and each do what they should, to the utmost of their abilities, we can get through an epidemic. I don’t think it’s necessary to dwell on who did what during the epidemic. People just did what they were supposed to. None of us did anything spectacular.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006302
China to Add State-Approved COVID Content to School Curricula,"The new material will focus on the country’s heroic fight against the pandemic, rather than on its enormous human and economic tolls.",2020-10-30,"China is planning to add new, government-endorsed content about the coronavirus pandemic to its national curricula for elementary and middle schools. In a statement Wednesday, the Ministry of Education said it is preparing a revision to the country’s compulsory education curriculum — the first through ninth grades — that will add content related to the COVID-19 pandemic to textbooks for biology, physical education and health, history, and Chinese literature. Chinese authorities believe they have good reason to be proud of their handling of the pandemic. With heavy-handed but effective measures including travel bans, strict stay-at-home orders, and rigorous contract tracing using mobile “health codes,” the country, after an initially large and chaotic outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, managed to bring the domestic situation under control by early April. In the months since, there have been sporadic clusters in cities including Beijing, Qingdao, and Urumqi, all of which were swiftly contained. Knowledge of outbreak prevention and control, and content about “the spirit of fighting the pandemic,” will be among the points of emphasis, according to the ministry. Wednesday’s statement is a response to a similar proposal from a delegate with the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislative body, earlier this year. “Students will learn about key figures who emerged during outbreak prevention and control efforts, as well as their deeds. They will learn to cultivate public service consciousness and dedication, and be enriched with knowledge about the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” the ministry said. Apart from widespread frustration with how authorities in the central Hubei province initially attempted to cover up mounting evidence of the new, potentially dangerous disease, even punishing doctors who tried to raise the alarm, the Chinese public seems mostly content with how the government has handled the pandemic — especially after late January, when top leaders made the unprecedented call to put all 11 million residents of Wuhan under lockdown. According to Wednesday’s announcement, “fighting spirit” content has already been incorporated into some recently revised high school curricula to ensure that students understand “the basic fact that the party and the country have always put the safety and health of the people first.” Earlier this year, as China faced criticism for its early handling of the outbreak, the country’s cabinet issued a white paper in June titled “China’s actions against the coronavirus pandemic” in a bid to set the record straight. Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at the time that the document’s purpose was to “leave the correct collective memory” for the country’s coronavirus response.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006369
Students Bound for COVID Hotbeds Scramble for Unproven Vaccines,"As young people headed abroad organize online to get into China’s emergency inoculation program, experts warn of the risks.",2020-10-27,"Fed up with taking online classes organized for a different time zone and paying rent for a room she wasn’t using, graduate student Chen decided last month to book a ticket to London for early November. Initially worried about the many daily coronavirus infections in the U.K., she resolved to just risk it. “I thought my destiny was to run straight into the virus,” Chen would later write on her Weibo microblog. But then, in late September, a classmate from Chen’s program in London forwarded her a webpage, purportedly by Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm, on which she could register her interest in receiving a vaccine for protection against the coronavirus. Skeptical of its authenticity, she filled it out without expecting much to come of it. There was some reason to believe it was genuine. China had begun a preliminary inoculation program in the summer. Three domestically developed COVID-19 vaccines had been greenlighted for emergency use to protect high-risk groups. Two of these come from Sinopharm, who has said that, although still in clinical trials, their shots have shown promising results without causing serious side effects.  Though the program’s intended target groups — medical staff, customs officials, and people working overseas — do not include students, the learners have spent the last few weeks desperately trying to get their hands on shots. In dozens of chat groups on messaging apps WeChat and QQ, these young adults in their late teens and early 20s have been guiding each other on how and whether to get a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to be proved safe or effective. To many, including Chen, moving to countries with daily COVID-19 cases in the thousands or even tens of thousands outweighs the risk of getting an experimental vaccination. “Compared with the harm of getting infected, the side effects of the vaccine aren’t even worth mentioning to me,” Chen, who did not want to use her given name out of privacy concerns, tells Sixth Tone. Experts, meanwhile, are urging caution. There’s no way of knowing, for now, whether it’s worth the risk, they say.  Chen was sucked into this world when, in early October, the webpage form she filled out produced a response. Sinopharm was going to start offering its COVID-19 vaccine in three cities — Wuhan, Beijing, and Guangzhou, a city in southern China near Chen — and students who were about to go abroad would be eligible, according to a text she showed Sixth Tone that claimed to be from China National Biotec Group, a Sinopharm subsidiary. Chen signed up without hesitation, and was soon added to a 300-person group chat titled “Group 3,” populated mostly by other students whose flights out of China were quickly approaching. “It turned out that our country had not given up on us,” Chen wrote in that same Weibo post, on Oct. 18. Meanwhile, domestic outlet Cls.cn broke the news of Sinopharm providing overseas-bound students priority access. The story was widely shared, and on social media some people lamented how this already-privileged group of people was being given precedence. The page Chen had used to register disappeared the next day. A week after Chen joined the WeChat group, on Oct. 13, an organizer whose identity remains unclear announced that the inoculation program in Guangzhou had been canceled. Chen first signed up to go to Wuhan, but the next day that program, too, was canceled. She then switched to the 2,000-person Beijing group chat. One day before Chen booked her flight, an organizer notified the group that Sinopharm could no longer provide them with vaccines. All group chats Chen had joined were closed that night. “At that moment, I kind of already knew there was no way for me to board this Noah’s Ark,” Chen says. “But I didn’t give up trying.”  Neither did other students. Xu, a Beijing-based sophomore enrolled at an American university, had also applied through the same webpage Chen had used, but after seeing how many people had signed up, she realized her chance of success would be low. After a friend of her father with the right connections “lent some help,” Xu nevertheless managed to schedule a vaccination appointment, she tells Sixth Tone. (Xu declined to use her full name because Sinopharm had her sign a nondisclosure agreement prior to being inoculated.) Because of imminent travel plans, Xu chose to receive two shots in one sitting, as opposed to leaving a two- to three-week gap that would better train the body’s immune system. After staying half an hour for observation, she left the hospital with two slightly sore arms and much relief. “I’m not that worried,” Xu says when asked about being administered an unapproved vaccine in a less-than-ideal fashion. “Lots of people are getting vaccinated. Also, I have to go back to the U.S. What other options do I have?”  It’s unclear how often Sinopharm offers two shots in one sitting, but Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist at Wuhan University, tells Sixth Tone that while he supports students going abroad getting one shot for “at least some protection,” getting two shots at the same time is “pointless.” It does not train our immune system any better than one shot would, he says. “Administering a bigger dose even has the possibility of triggering adverse reactions.” Sinopharm and China National Biotec Group did not respond to Sixth Tone’s request for comment. In any case, with the vaccines still in trials, people getting inoculated early are taking a risk. “What we know now is that the vaccines are safe at least in the short term,” Lu Hongzhou, an infectious disease expert at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, tells Sixth Tone. He says phase 1 and 2 trials that run for less than six months can catch acute adverse reactions, but the long-term side effects — if there are any — remain unknown. Early trials also only involve a few hundred participants, meaning it is possible adverse reactions that affect a tiny percentage of people remain undiscovered. Wang Jun, a pharmacologist at the University of Arizona in the U.S., tells Sixth Tone that emergency use authorization (EUA) is a risky move. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued such a permit to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, in March for treating COVID-19. However, growing evidence from larger and more rigorous studies later showed the drug didn’t work and could cause negative side effects. The FDA had to revoke the authorization within three months. “The permit can make many believe that the drug or vaccine is effective, but it can turn out to be the opposite. EUA has to be granted with extra care,” Wang says. “You can’t lower the standards of science because you want to be the first to have a (COVID-19) vaccine.”  In the U.S., authorities usually give emergency use permits based on early data from the large-scale trial, if it shows promise, Wang says. But it’s unclear on what information China has based its emergency use authorization. Executives at Sinopharm have repeatedly said their vaccines are safe and effective. The company’s chief legal consultant told domestic media last month they had given their vaccine to over 100,000 people and reported “no one with obvious adverse effects, and no one infected.” “They (the pharmaceutical companies) don’t release their data, so they can say whatever they want,” Wang says. “Without data from rigorously conducted studies, there’s no way to make that conclusion.”  Beijing-based biotech company Sinovac, the maker of the third COVID-19 vaccine that was approved for preliminary use, has also begun publicly rolling out its shots. In mid-October, authorities in eastern China’s Zhejiang province announced that several cities including Jiaxing, Yiwu, and Shaoxing would start accepting inoculation appointments for the company’s CoronaVac. These programs are aimed primarily at local residents who “wish to receive emergency inoculation,” according to the authorities. Liu Peicheng, a spokesperson at Sinovac, did not want to answer questions about the company’s domestic inoculation program. But he told Sixth Tone in an email that the company plans to conduct a preliminary analysis of data from its ongoing large-scale human trial in Brazil at the end of the year. “We hope drug administrations in countries like China, Brazil, and Indonesia can approve our vaccine as soon as we show its effectiveness in providing protection,” he says. “I think it’s a very personal choice whether to take the risk and get the experimental vaccine,” Qi Hai, an immunologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing, tells Sixth Tone. “But regardless of whether you get the shot, it’s utterly important to keep practicing mask wearing and social distancing. Even if the vaccines are largely effective, you may be among the small percentage of people the vaccine fails to protect.” For Evelyn Wu, a sophomore at University of Birmingham in the U.K., the choice was simple. Per her parents’ request, she returned to her hometown Yongkang, in Zhejiang province, in March when the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.K. began increasing. Earlier this month, a friend alerted her about the possibility of getting inoculated. “I decided to get vaccinated as soon as I saw the announcement,” Wu tells Sixth Tone. “I trust China’s research on the vaccine and our medical personnel.”  On Oct. 12, Wu scheduled an appointment at the local hospital, needing her identity card, passport, and proof of international travel plans. Two days later, Wu received her first injection for 228 yuan ($34), with a second one scheduled in a few weeks. She told Sixth Tone that the vaccination was pain-free and gave her a sense of security. “I will still be cautious though,” Wu says, adding that she plans to return to Birmingham in January. “It’s not (because I doubt) the efficacy of the vaccine; I just want to be well-prepared.” Chen, meanwhile, has given up hope. When she called Yiwu’s Center for Disease Control on Oct. 18, a staff member told her they had run out of the 500 shots they received, and that it was unclear when the next batch would arrive. Chen’s flight is now just days away. “First they said there were vaccines and I had high hopes, but then they suddenly said there were none,” she says. “I don’t want this one year study abroad to end before it even starts.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006357
Beijing to Track Frozen Meat Imports After Coronavirus Scare,"The city will require certain frozen food items to include scannable QR codes containing detailed information about the products, including their supply chain routes.",2020-10-27,"China’s capital has become the first city to roll out a digital platform for tracking the import routes of frozen meat and seafood after several COVID-19 infections were reported in recent months among people who had handled such items. In an announcement Monday, Beijing authorities said companies transporting or storing imported frozen food items will be required to upload details about the products — including their place of origin and import routes — on a government-made online platform starting Nov. 11. The announcement was jointly released by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce and the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce, which are responsible for market supervision and consumer rights protection. “For frozen meat and seafood imports that fail to meet the regulation requirement, the city’s imported cold chain food production operators shall not purchase, sell, or use the products,” the announcement said. Beijing’s decision to track the supply chain of imported frozen products comes after several seafood items were seen as potential COVID-19 infection sources, though there’s still no evidence that people can contract the virus through food items or packaging. In June, Beijing’s COVID-19 cluster was linked to a farmers market and a chopping board used for imported salmon, where the virus was detected. Meanwhile, port workers in the coastal city of Qingdao tested positive for the virus after handling frozen seafood products. Qingdao’s health commission later said that 51 out of 1,440 samples of frozen seafood being imported into the city had traces of the coronavirus. According to Monday’s announcement, all imported frozen meat and seafood packages in Beijing will now be required to have a QR code so consumers can find out the production date and source of production, as well as virus testing documentation. Liu Zhaowen, a manager for the Wumart supermarket chain in Beijing, told the state-run Xinhua News Agency that the store has been testing the city’s new tracking platform since October. He added that it would help to win consumers’ trust in the long run. “Many customers said they felt much more relieved (about food safety) after we promoted the platform at our store,” Liu said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006356
138 New Coronavirus Infections in Xinjiang,"Day after routine check discovered infected teenager, dozens of people at her parents’ workplace test positive.",2020-10-25,"In China’s largest single-day increase in coronavirus infections since April, 137 people in the northwestern city of Kashgar tested positive Sunday. All are coworkers of the parents of a 17-year-old girl who tested positive on Saturday during a routine check at her place of work, Kashgar health authorities said during a press conference Sunday. All 138 people are asymptomatic. Kashgar, located in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has activated its highest-level emergency response. Local authorities plan to test all of the city’s 620,000 residents within two days. As of Sunday morning, medical staff had taken samples from over 300,000 people. The girl’s parents and brother tested negative, as did 831 people at her place of work, described during the press conference as a garment factory where she lived most of the time and left for home about once every two weeks. The source of the outbreak is unclear. According to state-run newspaper People’s Daily, the 17-year-old had not been in close contact with people with confirmed or suspected infections, people with fevers, or wild animals during the two weeks before Saturday. Xinjiang last saw a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in July, one of the handful of flare-ups in China since its initial outbreak subsided.

Top Advisor to Chinese CDC on Country’s Post-COVID Reopening,"Before becoming an advisor to China’s top health authorities, Lance Rodewald spent 12 years as head of immunization services at the American CDC. Here’s how he thinks a global reopening could play out.",2020-10-23,"SHANGHAI — Lance Rodewald is a conspicuous presence in a convention hall. A senior advisor to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, he’s one of the few foreign faces at this week’s global science and technology forum in Shanghai, which most of his peers are attending virtually due to continued travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the former director of the U.S. CDC’s immunization services division for over a decade, Rodewald is in the unique position of being intimately familiar with both China’s disease control network and the American system it’s based on. Sixth Tone sat down with Rodewald on Friday for the weeklong Pujiang Innovation Forum to hear how he thinks global communities might begin to reopen and reconnect, even as COVID-19 continues to plague much of the planet. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Sixth Tone: How would you judge the success of China’s border control measures during the pandemic? We can see that virtually all new infections discovered in China these days are imported. If, instead of being quarantined, new arrivals were just allowed to go into the communities, there would, with each individual, be the potential for a local outbreak. One of the key lessons we’ve learned from pandemic control is that if the virus circulates within the community, it becomes very difficult to protect vulnerable people. So I think China probably has the best and strongest border control anywhere in the world. It’s strict and cautious, but also effective: People get tested before they come to China to make sure they're negative for the virus. They get tested when they arrive, and then again during their two weeks of mandatory quarantine. This is all to make sure that these travelers are not infected before they’re allowed to go into the community. The contact tracing and testing works.  Sixth Tone: What’s the next step? It’s not like everything’s going to stay closed forever. I don’t think so. You want to have normal international commerce, normal international exchange, and regular visits in and out. But this is something that’s yet to be figured out. You can see that China’s internal travel restrictions are significantly reduced, right? There are huge traffic jams in Beijing; the bike paths are full; children are in school and at college. So the domestic part is opening up. But whether to open up the international part involves some very complicated decisions. The recent change in visa rules allowing certain foreigners to enter China is clearly a signal that there is interest in reopening the country. Every step has to be carefully thought through, carefully evaluated and carefully monitored. Sixth Tone: In a pandemic, is there an ethical question in deciding to open the borders? It involves a trade-off between somebody raising the risk of others getting seriously ill, versus opening the economy that everybody depends on for their livelihoods. It’s a hard call, and clearly an ethical question. If the borders were just suddenly opened, there would be a lot of local outbreaks that would have to be stopped. Curbing these clusters requires a huge amount of effort and huge expense. These events are disruptive. Moreover, once the virus starts to circulate in communities, it can be very hard to protect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. I think there’s a strong desire — in China and throughout the world — to protect high-risk populations.  Sixth Tone: Do you consider an effective vaccine a necessary precondition before countries open up? I do think vaccines will play a role in making these decisions, maybe even a major role. The vaccines almost certainly will be able to prevent people from getting seriously ill. They may also prevent infection, which can help stop transmission of the virus. So vaccination is likely to be part of opening up international travel, because the people who would be coming in would be far less likely to bring the virus with them if they’ve been vaccinated. Because large-scale trials have yet to wrap up and announce their results, we don’t know the exact characteristics of the vaccines yet. There’s still so much that needs to be learned and evaluated. And a lot of this will have to be learned as the pandemic goes on and evolves. Sixth Tone: Will the world ever return to “normal,” the way it was before the pandemic? I’m an optimist. I think science programs, vaccines, treatment, and non-pharmaceutical interventions will defeat the virus. China has shown that it’s possible to defeat this virus. And I think this can happen globally, especially with the addition of vaccines. It’s not going to be easy, it’s not going to be fast — but I think eventually the pandemic will be defeated. So in that sense, the world may return to a similar state to the way it was before, where you don’t have to have all the non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing and border closures. But honestly, we don’t know when the next pandemic will hit. This may be a once-in-a-hundred-years event, or it could happen next year or next month. So part of going back to normal, I think, means learning lessons about preparedness, identification, detection, and response. People would really like to see this virus gone. With work, effort, science, and innovation, we will get there. I don’t think isolationism will become the new normal after the pandemic has passed, because countries want to be together in this world.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006332
Qingdao Outbreak May Trace to Stevedores Handling Contaminated Seafood,A document suggests the coronavirus may have spread from the two dock workers because of a hospital’s inadequately sterilized CT scan room.,2020-10-16,"The source of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in China’s major northeastern port city of Qingdao may trace to two dock workers who tested positive and were treated in the hospital where the cluster of infections appeared, according to people close to the matter. The two dock workers tested positive during screening at the Dagang Branch of Qingdao Port International Co. Ltd. and were reported asymptomatic on Sept. 24. They had handled imported frozen seafood, in some samples of which the COVID-19 virus was detected. But local health officials said later large-scale testing didn’t find new cases. Qingdao became the site of China’s first domestic COVID-19 outbreak in several months. As of Tuesday evening, officials had reported six confirmed cases and six asymptomatic cases. All of them were closely associated with the Qingdao Chest Hospital, which has been shut down since the outbreak. The two workers received treatment at Qingdao Chest Hospital, which is designated for treating imported cases, and were later transferred to another hospital, several doctors at the hospital told Caixin. The source of the outbreak hasn’t been officially disclosed, but a document circulating online indicated that the hospital didn’t sterilize its CT scan room thoroughly enough after treating COVID-19 patients. The hospital denied such assertions, and officials haven’t responded directly to the authenticity of the document. The hospital has only one CT scan room, which was used for chest scanning on both COVID-19 patients and other patients, according to a health worker at the hospital. Several workers said the CT room was strictly sterilized after each use. It’s difficult to determine the route of infection in the hospital, said Hu Bijie, a leading infectious disease expert at Shanghai’s Fudan University-affiliated Zhongshan Hospital. Insufficient sterilization of CT equipment may be a risk factor, but whether that was the transmission route cannot be determined, Hu said. In Shanghai’s designated hospitals, COVID-19 patients and other patients usually use separate CT scan equipment. Qingdao Chest Hospital, located in the center of the city, is designated for tuberculosis cases. In the past, it was also a designated treatment site for public health emergencies such as SARS, avian flu, and H1N1. Local residents told Caixin that the hospital is dated, its facilities poor. The Qingdao government has long planned to renovate and expand it. The city has started the mass testing of all 9.4 million of its residents. More than 4 million people in Qingdao have been tested, and 1.95 million test results showed no new confirmed infections, health officials said at a news briefing Tuesday. Mass testing is an important technical means of understanding the scale of the epidemic, said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Fighting Fake News With Fire: COVID-19 Post Lands Man in Jail,"Since the start of the pandemic, Chinese police have detained hundreds of “rumormongers.”",2020-10-15,"When a man surnamed Jin logged on to social media to discuss China’s COVID-19 flare-up earlier this week, he wasn’t shy about sharing some alternative facts. Soon after, Jin became one of the hundreds of people to be given brief jail sentences this year for spreading false information about the pandemic. Police in Qingdao, the eastern Chinese city that on Monday reported 12 new infections, said the 21-year-old had exaggerated the extent of the outbreak in order to gain followers on microblogging site Weibo. Jin was given 15 days’ administrative detention — a punishment that in China does not require a judge’s involvement — and fined 500 yuan ($74), police announced Tuesday. The Chinese government regulates what can be posted on social media, with all accounts linked to people’s ID cards. It has used administrative detention as a deterrent for years — for example, when people exaggerated the number of casualties after a building collapsed in 2016. But Chinese police have seemed especially active cracking down on false information about the COVID-19 pandemic. On Feb. 21, at a time when China was seeing hundreds of new infections a day, the Ministry of Public Security said police around the country had handled 5,511 cases of false or harmful information about the coronavirus, without specifying the punishments involved. By the end of March, Chinese media had written about nearly 900 such cases, a report found. “Most people involved in these cases were administratively detained for 3-15 days and forced to admit wrongdoing,” it said. “Some of them were fined, given verbal warnings, educational reprimand, or criminal detention.” In most instances, they had gotten in trouble for posts on Weibo or messaging app WeChat. More social media users have been locked up since. In June, during an outbreak in Beijing, police there announced 60 misinformation cases, detaining 10 people — some of whom had falsely claimed thousands of people had died — and reprimanding the others. In March, a new cybersecurity regulation went into effect. It stated that anyone who “spreads rumors” and “disturbs social order” is in violation of the law, and in some cases may be criminally prosecuted, without specifying penalties. The country’s top court and prosecutor had previously said in 2013 that those who create misleading social media posts that are viewed 5,000 times and shared 500 times may be charged with defamation, a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. Chinese authorities’ rumor-quashing tools also include the ability to directly flag posts on Weibo, as well as various sites on which they dispel popular falsehoods. While Qingdao’s health authorities are now testing the city’s entire population of over 9 million for the coronavirus, resulting in no new positive tests so far, the local internet regulator’s rumor-busting platform on WeChat has been busy setting the record straight about some widely shared falsehoods. Since the start of the current outbreak, it has collected around 20 examples. People sharing fake information about COVID-19 has been an issue on Western social media, too, though perpetrators face far less severe consequences. Most famously, U.S. President Donald Trump’s untrue claim that COVID-19 isn’t as lethal as the flu was hidden by Twitter and deleted by Facebook. China’s approach has at times also backfired. In March, authorities in Wuhan were forced to give a rare apology to the family of Li Wenliang, one of eight doctors police had reprimanded in early January for “spreading rumors” about a string of pneumonia cases. Li’s death from COVID-19 in February triggered an outpouring of grief, but also anger over how he had been treated.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006294
COVID-19 Vaccine Ready for Chinese Public: Report,An insider said people in Wuhan and Beijing will be among the first eligible to schedule appointments with coronavirus vaccine developer Sinopharm.,2020-10-13,"Pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm may soon begin offering COVID-19 vaccine appointments to residents in Wuhan and Beijing, both affected by coronavirus outbreaks earlier this year. People in the two Chinese cities will reportedly be able to schedule appointments via Sinopharm’s official website or multipurpose app WeChat. They will then be notified to go to an affiliated facility for the shots. Since domestic outlet CLS.cn broke the news Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the matter, it has been widely shared by other Chinese media, including Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. According to The Paper’s report Monday, a WeChat applet run in cooperation with Sinopharm was allowing people to sign up for appointments. By Tuesday afternoon, however, the applet was no longer accessible. Sinopharm has not responded to the reports, and Sixth Tone’s attempts to contact the company Tuesday were unsuccessful. An insider told CLS.cn that Chinese international students — particularly those planning to go abroad in the winter or spring — will be prioritized for vaccinations and receive them free of charge. How much the vaccine will cost for others remains unclear. Zheng Zhongwei, head of the National Health Commission’s vaccine research and development team, said in September that the price of any future vaccine “must be within a range that the public can accept.” Previously, Sinopharm’s chairman had suggested in August that a two-dose course would cost up to 1,000 yuan ($150) — though a top executive at China National Biotec Group, Sinopharm’s subsidiary making the vaccines, later said the price would be no more than 600 yuan. Last week, the World Health Organization said as much as one-tenth of the world’s population may have been infected with the coronavirus. Meanwhile, epidemiologists are concerned about the potential for a “second wave” of infections with the approach of winter, also expected to coincide with flu season. Since July, hundreds of thousands of people in China — including medical workers, border inspectors, military personnel, staff at transport hubs, and employees at large companies — have been inoculated with candidate vaccines still undergoing late-stage human trials and awaiting approval. Though there are risks associated with unapproved vaccines, according to multiple reports, those who have been inoculated with candidates aren’t experiencing severe side effects and aren’t contracting the coronavirus. China is among the global front-runners in the race for a vaccine against the COVID-19 virus. Five of the 11 candidate vaccines that have been approved for late-stage human trials are Chinese-developed, two by Sinopharm. On Friday, China announced that it would join COVAX, a global initiative for providing future vaccines to other countries in proportion to their need, effectively aiding the world’s most vulnerable nations. Correction: A previous version of this story referred to China National Biotec Group as a rival vaccine developer to Sinopharm. The two companies merged in 2009, and CNBG is Sinopharm’s vaccine-making subsidiary.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006283
Checking In on China’s Post-Pandemic Middle Class,Can middle-class Chinese withstand the aftershocks of COVID-19?,2020-10-12,"When I asked Christine, a 40-something Shanghai native with a degree from a top university, a job in the tourism industry, and a home in the city, how the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted her place in China’s middle class, she quickly corrected me. “I have never perceived my family to be part of the middle class,” she said. “When I hear ‘middle class,’ I think of my clients. They have more money from their own companies or their jobs as skilled professionals or managers in large enterprises. My husband and I both work in the service industry; it’s very fragile.” Christine’s response reflects public perceptions of the middle class in China, which are heavily influenced by TV dramas, novels, commercials, and other mass culture products that depict businesspeople, managers, and intellectual elites with very high incomes as “middle class.” These portrayals differ significantly from sociological definitions of the term, which measure objective indicators like education, income, occupation, and consumption. By these metrics, anywhere from 20%-50% of the country’s urban population would qualify as middle class. That includes Christine and her husband — another local Shanghainese with an prestigious degree. The pair have worked in the travel and tourism industry for almost two decades and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle characterized by homeownership, car ownership, yearly trips overseas, and generous spending on their daughter’s education. Like the rest of China’s middle class, the couple’s socioeconomic status is the product of the country’s explosive economic growth since the 1980s. To give just one example, China recorded 155 million outbound trips in 2019, up from less than 6 million in 2000. This boom in consumption has created opportunities for people like Christine, whose employer runs one of the more than 4,800 travel agencies in China licensed to book international trips.  However, Christine did have a point. The coronavirus outbreak has dealt a heavy blow to China’s economy — not least the tourism industry, which effectively ground to a halt this spring. Amid a wave of job losses and wage reductions across the service sector, China’s white-collar middle class has gotten a stark reminder of how fragile their newfound status can be. So, how are they coping? And more importantly, how might their experiences impact the future of the middle class as a whole? In my discussions with white-collar middle-class Chinese who’d been hit hard by the pandemic, stories of individual resilience stood out. This is partly a matter of economic status: They benefitted from previously accumulated socioeconomic advantages, such as savings cushions or spouses still securely employed in the state sector. But they were also quick to adjust to the new normal. Frank, a mid-level manager at a bus company, had his wages slashed by 60% when business cratered this year. Although he originally hoped to send his daughter to the United States for graduate school, he now seems content that she found a job in Shanghai. Similarly, in the early stages of the outbreak, Christine worried that her lost income would impact her teenage daughter’s education prospects. But she gradually adjusted to her new reality by cutting back where she could. For instance, while her daughter used to be allowed to participate in any number of extracurricular programs or trips, the family has become more strategic since the pandemic began. Reflecting on her privilege, Christine said, “Our family income is less than half of what it was before (the outbreak). But sometimes I think: This is actually the regular income of many couples. They also need to live and raise their child in Shanghai, and they manage to have a good life.” Similar stories of resilience can also be found on the collective level. One thing that surprised Amanda, one of Christine’s co-workers, was how the pandemic had brought their team closer together. As their business collapsed, everyone pitched in to find whatever moneymaking opportunities they could, ranging from helping their previous clients sell goods on the side of the street to folding food delivery boxes in the office. And with more “free” time to talk to each other during these activities, Amanda and her co-workers found themselves connecting on a deeper level. “It was nice sitting there working with our hands and chatting with each other,” Amanda told me. “I had never invited some of my co-workers over before, but now they have been my houseguests many times.” Outside of the workplace, acquaintances, former classmates, clients, neighbors, and even small business owners all seem to be reaching out and talking to each other more. One motivation has been the need to find potential economic and employment opportunities. Christine and her co-workers got one of their temporary make-work jobs through the owner of the pastry shop next to their travel agency, for instance. At the same time, there also seems to be an element of genuine mutual care and understanding as so many people face similar trials. For example, as more people turned to selling goods on social media platform WeChat as a way to make ends meet, they noticed their friends in less dire straits ordering from them, not out of necessity, but out of compassion. Among those I spoke to, these kind gestures and the sense of connectedness they brought proved as important and comforting, if not more so, than direct monetary assistance.  That’s not to say everything’s changing for the better. For many Chinese, the job and wage losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic only aggravated their existing problems. Christine has a former high-school classmate who can now barely afford his wife’s cancer treatment with his slashed wages. This has had a trickle-down effect on others in their social circle, as her classmate’s difficulties have forced Christine to reckon with her own uncertain future. To cope with her anxiety, Christine and her husband have vowed to save more and spend less, even when the economy recovers. Her attempts to find a job in a less vulnerable industry have foundered, however, as rampant age discrimination has made it impossible for her to locate new work without personal connections. Instead, predicting that international business travel might not recover, even after the pandemic, Christine chose to stay at her current job but shift her specialty from booking international plane tickets to domestic tourism. Post-pandemic, China’s white-collar middle class will probably continue to demonstrate individual as well as collective resilience in the face of hardship. But this resilience could have a negative impact on China’s economic development as a whole, as even relatively privileged Chinese retrench and save rather than resume spending. Given the circumstances, policies to mitigate against future uncertainty, or even just to make it easier for individuals to weather sudden economic changes, regardless of their social class, could go a long way toward restoring a much-needed sense of security and solidarity in the population.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006213
12 New COVID-19 Cases Discovered in Qingdao,All of the infections are linked to a hospital where international travelers who tested positive for the coronavirus were treated.,2020-10-12,"Twelve people in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao have tested positive for COVID-19, municipal health authorities reported early Monday, days after a holiday week when hundreds of millions of people traveled throughout the country. The latest outbreak, which includes six asymptomatic cases, is linked to a chest hospital in Qingdao responsible for treating passengers arriving from abroad who tested positive for COVID-19 upon entering China, the local health commission said Sunday. Among the dozen cases are patients who visited the hospital for non-coronavirus treatments and their family members, as well as health aids working at the facility. The infection routes are still unclear.  Qingdao, which is located in the coastal Shandong province, last month reported that two port workers who had handled imported frozen seafood tested positive for COVID-19 but did not show symptoms. No additional infections were identified after testing over 210,000 people who had been in close contact with the two workers, or who were otherwise considered high-risk, according to the health authority Friday. In response to the current outbreak, local authorities have begun citywide testing to screen all 9 million residents within five days. Meanwhile, the chest hospital has closed its outpatient clinic. China has experienced several flare-ups of COVID-19 since the country’s initial outbreak subsided earlier this year. This summer, Beijing reported hundreds of infections linked to a massive food market, and the city subsequently sealed off several residential communities and shut down schools. Together with large-scale testing, such aggressive measures have also controlled outbreaks in the provincial-level regions of Jilin, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. Health authorities across the country have issued advisories warning people against nonessential travel to Qingdao, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. Last week was the country’s National Day holiday, which saw 637 million people traveling domestically. Over 4 million visited Qingdao. Shandong’s capital of Jinan has called for anyone who has visited Qingdao since Sept. 23 to get tested for the coronavirus.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006279
"Despite Expected Supply Crunch, China Joins COVID-19 Vaccine Sharing Plan","With five coronavirus vaccines approved for large-scale trials, China is currently a global front-runner.",2020-10-09,"China has joined an international initiative supporting fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across the globe, the country’s foreign ministry said Friday. Aiming to distribute vaccines equally among participating countries according to their size, the so-called COVAX scheme is an attempt to avoid vaccine-producing countries prioritizing their own populations and allies over countries more in need. The move came after the country’s leaders had vowed repeatedly to provide vaccine support to allied developing countries such as Cambodia and Laos. President Xi Jinping had also said during a health conference in May that once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in China, it “will be made a global public good.” China is one of the front-runners in COVID-19 vaccine development. Chinese institutions are behind five of the 11 candidates that have so far been approved for large-scale human trials across the globe. Since July, Beijing has approved at least three experimental vaccines for “emergency use,” which have been administered mainly to high-risk people such as frontline medical workers. Wu Guizhen, a senior official at China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month that the country would have a COVID-19 vaccine ready by November or December this year, without referring to any specific candidate. China joins at least 168 countries — potential vaccine producers Russia and the U.S. notably not among them — in signing up to the COVAX Facility initiative, which is led by the World Health Organization; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to make shots available first to “prioritized target groups” like frontline medical workers or the elderly, whom the WHO estimates to make up around one-fifth of a given country’s population. Any vaccines approved for use will likely be in short supply initially. For example, Sinopharm, a state-owned pharmaceutical company that has two vaccines in the last stage of human trials, can make around 300 million doses per year, its CEO Liu Jingzhen said last month. If the company’s vaccines follow a two-dose schedule, as has been the case in clinical trials, yearly production would only be enough for about 10% of China’s 1.4 billion people. Though the global supply of vaccines will likely rely on a variety of companies and countries, China deciding to share might present difficult decisions, Klaus Stöhr, an epidemic expert who previously worked at the WHO, told Nature on Thursday. “The number of doses available in China will by far be too little to permit export unless a political decision is taken to ship vaccines overseas despite still-existing vaccine needs in China,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006268
How Old Beliefs Are Adapting to China’s ‘New Normal’,"After months of being closed, Shanghai’s places of worship are cautiously reopening to the public.",2020-10-05,"This July 21 marked the first day of the sixth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, a date when religiously observant Chinese typically flock to temples around the country to light incense in honor of the new month. Normally this would be an unremarkable occasion: Similar “incense-burning periods” take place on the first and 15th of every lunar month. But this isn’t a normal time, and July 21 was the first incense-burning period for which Shanghai’s City God Temple was open to worshippers since Jan. 24. As a temple volunteer, it was my job to guide the faithful through our new entry procedures. Everyone needed four things to gain admittance: a green health code; a face mask; a registration code obtained through the temple’s social media platform; and a 10 yuan ($1.50) incense-flower coupon — a more polite way of saying a ticket. When booking, prospective visitors had to provide their real names, ID card numbers, and contact information. Finally, all templegoers needed to pass a temperature check.  In fact, the City God Temple has long wanted to introduce an online booking system, which among other things finally allows young, digitally savvy visitors to pay for their tickets online, rather than in cash. Yet for one reason or another, it kept getting put off, until a pandemic forced matters to a head. The system’s rollout did not go off without a hitch. On July 21, over a week after the temple first opened, I found myself almost surrounded by templegoers: Some hadn’t brought their ID card or couldn’t remember their ID number, others didn’t own a smartphone or didn’t bring it, a few had their phone but didn’t have money in their digital wallet, and still more had bad eyesight and struggled to read text on their phone clearly. Some regular visitors to the City God Temple had heard on the news that the temple was finally reopening, but not that they would need a phone to enter. They were left to worship the City God from outside the newly erected fence, quietly chanting: “We came to see you, City God, but we couldn’t get in. Know our intentions were good.” Those that did make it inside all received a spray of sanitizer on their hands without so much as a by your leave. For many Chinese, visiting a holy site is as much a tactile experience as a spiritual one, meaning they are accustomed to touching parts or statues inside — especially shrines — for good luck. Although it is not clear how long the coronavirus can survive outside the human body, one can never be too careful. Public health-related restrictions on visitor numbers, plus templegoers’ own caution, meant that the City God Temple is no longer the crowded and noisy place it once was. Inside the temple’s main hall, the kneeling cushions have been removed to prevent potential cross-infections by worshippers kowtowing. The temple published an article on its social media feed calling on worshippers to instead bow when paying their respects. Some regular worshippers, on seeing the article, instead opted to bring their own prayer cushions. Shanghai’s Xujiahui Catholic Church, for example, reopened on July 10, though only to registered members of the church. It remains closed to visitors, and each mass is limited to 300 people. Church members are encouraged to reserve a spot in advance. I attended a mass at the church on Aug. 15, also the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since I didn’t make an appointment in advance, I was required to fill out a form at the entrance providing information about my health and travel. Inside the church there were signs placed on the seats. Whereas each pew could previously seat six people, only three are now allowed. During mass, volunteers reminded parishioners to keep their masks on and to maintain their distance between one another. To reduce the risk of cross-infection, the church’s Bibles had all been put away, with members either bringing their own or reading from the text and lyrics displayed on screens. When it was time to receive communion, volunteers held up signs and guided the congregation to where they should line up. The priest then placed the wafer in the hands of the attendees, rather than in their mouths. One churchgoer told me that apart from this, the service was just like normal. During the COVID-19 pandemic, religious congregations around the world have tried to set up remote services. And as in the case of Shanghai’s City God Temple, the events of the past nine months have pushed many hidebound institutions to familiarize themselves with how new technologies can be used to consolidate, strengthen, and exchange beliefs. Still, if my experiences are anything to go by, these new advances will never truly be able to replace in-person religious activities. But with COVID-19 continuing to spread, no one can say for sure whether this tentative reopening is the “new normal” or just temporary. As one Taoist priest I spoke with, Xia Dachi, told me: “Although the temple has reopened, if there’s another outbreak, we should be prepared to close at any time.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006129
How COVID-19 Border Controls Split China’s Transnational Families,"China will allow residence permit holders to reenter the country from Sept. 28, but the forced separations of the past few months suggest it’s time to fix its outdated immigration policies.",2020-09-28,"Ran is Chinese. His wife, Juri, is Japanese. Married for three years, they’ve spent the past year living apart: Ran in the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou and Juri in Tokyo, where she was studying for her master’s degree. In March 2020, two months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Ran accompanied Juri to the airport for her flight back to Japan, where she would defend her thesis. Ran had hoped to follow his wife abroad once the pandemic abated in China, but their plans soon went awry. On March 9, following a sharp uptick in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Japan, the country effectively barred most Chinese citizens from entry. Around the same time, the couple received some happier news: Juri was pregnant. She wanted to give birth in China, where she would have the support of her husband and his family. As the outbreak gradually subsided on the Chinese mainland, she booked a flight from Japan for early April. But in the last week of March, with COVID-19 cases spiking around the world, it was China’s turn to bar foreigners from entry. The sweeping policy, which went into effect on March 28, allowed exemptions only for diplomatic, official, humanitarian, and a select few other purposes. Juri emailed the Chinese consulate in Tokyo, describing her family’s plight in hopes of obtaining a visa via the humanitarian exemption. However, she was informed that only “the death or imminent death of immediate family members” would be considered a legitimate basis for such an application. Juri’s request was denied. Over the past nine months, there have been countless cases like Ran and Juri’s, in which mixed-nationality families have been separated or kept apart by new, pandemic-driven immigration policies. The problems with these policies are to an extent understandable, given the haste with which they were adopted. But their bitter fruits have prompted some in China and around the world to ask broader questions about how border control regimes reflect a country’s treatment and conceptualization of transnational or mixed identities, as well as how these identities can be served and protected in more flexible and humane ways. China is not alone in having implemented strict border controls. In denying entry to almost anyone without a Chinese passport — including long-term residents, immediate family members of citizens, and foreign nationals studying or working in the country — its approach has mirrored that of other countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Russia, and Laos. This might have been easier to bear if China recognized dual citizenship or was less stingy in its issuance of green cards. As it stands, however, the sudden suspension of visa-based entry effectively cut tens of thousands of people off from their schools, places of work, and loved ones. Aran is a citizen of the European Union. Born in the eastern Zhejiang province, he is currently researching communities along China’s southeastern coast. He told me that the pandemic and ensuing travel bans had given him a new perspective on his doctoral project, which relates to Chinese identity, diplomacy, and soft power. Aran, who had been visiting Taiwan for the Lunar New Year when COVID-19 turned his short trip into a six-month stay, saw the Chinese mainland’s strict entry controls as a stress response stemming from having witnessed the initial outbreak and fears related to its large and mobile population. But he also thinks the decision may have been related to China’s proportionally small immigrant population, a demographic pattern shared by many East Asian countries. He suggested that the Chinese mainland could have instead tied entry to visa categories, as the European Union did. This would have enabled residence permit holders including students, workers, and spouses to re-enter the country. Debates over whether and how to reform the country’s immigration and residency rules are a relatively new issue in China. Already the world’s most populous nation, efforts to enact laws giving permanent residency to greater numbers of foreigners have typically been met by fierce backlash from a public unconvinced of the need for more people. But where does that leave couples like Ran and Juri? And what of those accustomed to straddling two or more cultures? Pre-coronavirus, the ease of international travel gave many transnational individuals a false sense of security. They believed they could work freely and balance their lives between different societies, regardless of their formal nationality. Jun, a 20-year-old college student of Chinese and Japanese descent, was caught off guard by the realization that the word “foreigner” in the March 28 notice applied to him. Jun’s parents live in Shanghai, and he spent six years in the city’s secondary schools. Yet, despite being fluent in Chinese and treated by his Chinese acquaintances as “one of us,” his Japanese passport effectively rendered his “idealized and romanticized” dual identity useless this spring, when he found himself cut off from his parents by the new entry rules. The ideals of globalization — openness, inclusivity, and the possibility of multifaceted and mixed identity — are currently under siege, and previously mobile individuals are having to adapt or re-adapt to a world of closed borders. When I spoke to them, Juri and Ran were already mentally preparing for a long separation. “I really want to go back to China, and I really miss my husband and family,” Juri told me. “But maybe the best thing for the baby is for me to just stay where I am.” It may not come to that. This month, China announced it would finally begin allowing residence permit holders back into the country from Sept. 28. Still, the past few months should be a wake-up call. For years, countries trumpeted the virtues of globalization. Millions took these affirmations at face value, only to have the rug pulled from under them. Even amid a pandemic, we have every reason to expect nations to recognize the challenges faced by these individuals, and to help them reunite with their loved ones.

Qingdao Reports Asymptomatic COVID-19 Cases in Port Workers,The infected patients were involved in handling frozen products from a seafood importer.,2020-09-25,"Two newly discovered asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in a Chinese port city are once again pointing to frozen seafood packaging as a potential source of infection. The two individuals, surnamed Dong and Chen, worked at a local port management company in Qingdao, Shandong province, and were involved in offloading frozen seafood before they tested positive for COVID-19 during a routine screening, the Qingdao Municipal Health Commission said in a statement Thursday. By the same day, health officials had traced and quarantined 132 close contacts of the patients: Of the 129 who were tested, none came back positive. In a separate statement Friday, the health commission said 51 out of 1,440 samples from the frozen seafood importer’s products had traces of coronavirus. None of the products from the contaminated batch have entered the market. The infections in Qingdao are the latest cases of contaminated frozen food resulting in coronavirus clusters. In July, Dalian in the northeastern Liaoning province reported 85 local infections related to a frozen seafood processing plant. A month earlier, authorities in Beijing also reported 335 cases linked to imported food — the virus was detected on a chopping board used for salmon — at the city’s Xinfadi farmers market. All of those infected had recovered by August. So far, there’s no evidence that a person can contract the coronavirus from food or food packaging. However, China’s central authorities in July ordered mandatory testing for workers at food markets nationwide in a bid to ward off potential sources of infection.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006235
"Demand for Flu Shots, Rare in China, Spikes Amid ‘Twindemic’ Fears",Concerns over COVID-19 underscore China’s poor influenza vaccination rates.,2020-09-25,"SHANGHAI — For years, Yu has been one of the few Chinese people who get their flu shots when the weather turns colder. It has always been a routine procedure. But this year, fears over how the coming flu season will compound the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic seem to have dramatically increased demand for the shots. With this in mind, Yu left home early on Tuesday to visit her local clinic. From a distance, the 65-year-old could see a line snaking out of the clinic’s front door. When Yu had called ahead of time, she was told that only the first 100 people to show up would receive flu shot appointments. Clutching her purse, she rushed to join the line, accepting a small strip of paper from a clinic employee. In black, handwritten ink was the number “97.” “I was so relieved when I saw the note,” Yu, who only gave her surname because she wanted to keep her medical information private, tells Sixth Tone. Public health experts around the world, too, are worried about a “twindemic” — a situation where the coronavirus and influenza virus are both circulating among the population. Simultaneous outbreaks could push already-overwhelmed health care systems over the edge. Though far less lethal than COVID-19, the flu can spread widely and lead to symptoms requiring hospitalization, and even death in a small proportion of cases. In China, flu and its complications are estimated to kill over 88,000 people every year. Nationwide infection figures are not available, but a study of Beijing residents showed that 10% of them contracted the flu in the 2017-18 season.  China’s COVID-19 outbreak is currently well-controlled, but without a safe and effective vaccine, health professionals are anticipating a coronavirus resurgence in the next few months. Respiratory viruses like the ones that cause COVID-19 and influenza are more easily transmitted in winter and spring due to a variety of natural and human factors. “Cluster (COVID-19) infections from imported sources like what we saw in Beijing and Jilin are inevitable,” says Lu Hongzhou, a leading virologist at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, referring to two places that experienced outbreaks months after the disease was brought under control in China. He tells Sixth Tone that moving forward, he doesn’t expect another situation as serious as in Wuhan, the city in central China that was locked down for 76 days to contain the disease. Crucially, both viral infections produce highly similar symptoms: fever, sore throat, headache, and fatigue. A flu outbreak would therefore make COVID-19 control and prevention extremely difficult, Zhang Xiaoqin, a respiratory disease expert at Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital in eastern China, tells Sixth Tone. Studies have also suggested that co-infections — relatively rare so far — make diagnosis more difficult, and increase the likelihood of severe symptoms and death. “It’s still inconclusive whether the flu makes COVID-19 worse,” Zhang says. “But if more people can get the flu vaccine, it would make coronavirus prevention much easier.”  Domestic health authorities agree. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released this year’s flu vaccination guideline on Sept. 12, about a month earlier than last year. “The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to keep circulating critically around the globe,” the guideline says. “The flu vaccine is the most effective approach to preventing the flu. (It) can reduce the harm caused by the flu and related diseases while freeing up medical resources.” Expecting an uptick in demand, the central government has greenlit over 58 million shots for market entry — more than double last year’s number — to meet the potential surge. But interest this year is hard to predict, Feng Luzhao, an influenza vaccine expert with China’s CDC and co-author of its flu vaccination guideline, tells Sixth Tone. Demand may vary regionally, creating supply imbalances across the country. Xia Wen, a press officer at Shanghai’s CDC, tells Sixth Tone that the city is expecting a shortage of flu shots. At Yu’s clinic in Shanghai, the Ruijin 2nd Street Community Healthcare Center, staff say they’ve limited the number of appointments because they have no idea when or how many of the vaccines will arrive. “The number of people who showed up this year is unprecedented,” an employee surnamed Chen tells Sixth Tone. “I think it’s because of COVID-19. People are scared of getting sick.” Adequately matching flu shot supply with public demand has always been difficult. Because the dominant influenza strain changes every year, pharmaceutical companies are afraid of producing too many vaccines, as they will likely be useless next year. Making vaccines — which usually involves cultivating viruses in large quantities of chicken eggs — also takes several months. As a result, it’s nearly impossible to make up for sudden shortages, Feng says.  But Feng and other experts welcome the increase in demand for flu shots, noting that in previous years, too few people were inoculated — just 2% to 3% of the population. At 4%, this year’s expected vaccination rate is still low, they say. By comparison, around 50% of the population in the U.S. receives an influenza vaccination each year. China’s flu vaccination rates are low for a variety of reasons. People lack knowledge about the disease and its dangers, says Feng, and there are no statistics that show the true scale of the yearly outbreaks. “Many deaths that are the result of influenza aren’t diagnosed as such, because it’s not the direct cause of death,” he says. Shots are unpopular, too, because many people in China will only seek treatment after they become ill, instead of taking preventive measures, says Zhang of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital. “A lot of patients don’t even know some of the very basic information about flu shots, like when and where to get them.”  Another barrier to higher vaccination rates is that shots are not covered by China’s government-provided insurance, which is the only health care coverage most people have. China’s social security policies state that vaccination is the purview of the public health system rather than the medical system, and vaccinations therefore fall outside of the scope of insurance. China offers a total of 11 free vaccines that are mandatory for children, including those against hepatitis B and MMR (measles, mumps, rubella). For all other vaccines, including those against HPV and influenza, people usually have to pay out of pocket. In Shanghai, a flu shot costs 53 yuan to 136 yuan ($7 to $20). Providing free flu shots would be prohibitively expensive for the government, says Meng Qingyue, a health economist at Peking University. “When you only have a limited amount of money, it makes sense to allocate the funds to prevent the most damaging diseases,” he tells Sixth Tone. “But the current vaccine policy of (offering them) either completely free or completely charged is also not optimal.” In addition, the separation of China’s public health and medical care systems means many health care facilities — such as local clinics — belong to one or the other, and as such cannot offer a full range of services. “The separation of the two systems makes getting vaccines a lot harder,” Fang Hai, a vaccine policy expert at Peking University, tells Sixth Tone. Unlike in countries where both systems are integrated, Chinese people might find themselves unable to receive vaccinations at their usual health care facility, discouraging them from getting shots. Fang hopes the government will start providing more financial support for influenza vaccines. “It would become a positive feedback loop,” he says. Subsidized prices would give drug companies the confidence to increase production, which would in turn drive down costs and incentivize still more people to get vaccinated. The experience from the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is coming to an end, offers a silver lining. Precautions against COVID-19, such as wearing face masks and social distancing, have helped keep flu cases in southern locales to record lows, offering a glimpse of hope for people on the opposite side of the planet.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006238
Yunnan on Alert Over Imported Coronavirus Cases,The most recent infections were discovered in two individuals who had illegally crossed the province’s land border with Myanmar.,2020-09-15,"A city in the southwestern Yunnan province has gone into “wartime mode” after two travelers from Myanmar tested positive for the coronavirus.  The 32-year-old woman and her 16-year-old maid — both Myanmarese nationals — had illegally crossed the border to the city of Ruili on Sept. 3, the provincial health commission said in a statement Monday. Following the recent infections, authorities imposed strict restrictions on eight cities and 25 counties along the border, while citywide nucleic testing will be carried out in Ruili. The new infections have sparked concerns over illegal crossings in the province, which shares a 1,941-kilometer border with Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam. China banned all foreigners from entering the country in March, though it is slowly easing some travel restrictions. Yang Bianqiang, deputy director of the police department in Dehong Prefecture, where Ruili is located, said the two individuals who illegally entered the country will be prosecuted, as will those who assisted them. Yang also vowed to tighten border controls through increased patrolling and by encouraging local residents to report illegal crossings. “There is no natural border between Ruili and Myanmar,” Yang said during a press conference Monday. “Citizens in Ruili and Myanmar speak the same language and visit each other very often. It is difficult to monitor their travels.” As of Monday, Yunnan had seven confirmed and four asymptomatic coronavirus cases, all of them imported, according to authorities.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006181
"Low Tech, High Speed: Inside China’s Race to a COVID-19 Vaccine",Over half of all coronavirus vaccine candidates to reach late-stage human trials are Chinese-developed. But are they the world’s best shot at beating COVID-19?,2020-09-15,"GUANGDONG, South China — Winter is coming. People will soon be spending more time indoors. The COVID-19 pandemic may get worse, and a vaccine isn’t ready. The world is nine months into an all-out war against the novel coronavirus, and hope for a safe and effective vaccine that would help restore some semblance of normality is still just a glimmer on the horizon. But vaccine makers are working around the clock at a blistering pace. As of Sept. 9, the World Health Organization had recorded 180 vaccine candidates to combat the COVID-19 virus. Thirty-two of them have begun human trials. China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected, is among the front-runners: Of the nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates that have been approved for large-scale human trials, five are developed by Chinese institutes or companies.   In July, the country’s central government approved three experimental vaccines for “emergency use.” The program was intended to protect people at high risk of contracting the virus, such as medical staff. But thousands of employees at state-owned firms have also received inoculations since June, according to domestic outlet Caixin. All three products are inactivated vaccines. This design helps build antiviral immunity by injecting the body with a “dead” form of the pathogen to train the immune system how to respond to an actual infection.  China National Biotec Group (CNBG), the pharmaceutical company behind two of the experimental vaccines, has already administered its products to over 100,000 people, senior staff told domestic media. Zhou Song, the company’s chief legal consultant, said there were “no obvious adverse reactions” and “no one became infected.” Currently, CNBG’s vaccine candidates are undergoing phase 3 clinical trials — the last stage before approval — in the United Arab Emirates, Peru, and Morocco, with thousands of subjects participating. While test results are pending, an executive at the company said the vaccines will likely be approved by the end of the year and follow a two-dose schedule. China’s medical products regulator has not responded to this projected timeline. Meanwhile, China’s early front-runner vaccine candidate is falling behind. Ad5-nCoV, a so-called vector vaccine developed by domestic firm CanSino Biologics and the government-backed Academy of Military Medical Sciences, was the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine to be injected into humans back in March. However, a plan to undergo phase 2 trials in Canada was put on hold after Chinese customs indefinitely delayed the vaccine product shipment for reasons that have not been made clear, according to Canada’s National Research Council. CanSino said in August that while the partnership with Canada has not been terminated, the company is now working to establish large-scale trials in other countries including Russia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. However, none of the trials has begun recruiting volunteers, according to their official registrations.  Despite massive investment in vaccine development globally, not all of the candidates will prove successful and be approved for the market — and in any event, dozens of different vaccines protecting against the same disease would be unnecessary. But for Dong Chen, dean of Tsinghua University’s School of Medicine, the high cost is worth it. At this stage, no one knows which candidate will work best, he told Sixth Tone at a vaccine summit in the southern city of Shenzhen on Saturday. “We didn’t complete the journey last time, so we don’t know what to do when coronaviruses emerge,” Dong said, referring to a previous push in 2003 to develop a vaccine against the SARS coronavirus. Because that coronavirus epidemic subsided before a vaccine was ready, the in-progress projects were terminated. “So this time, it’s a boot camp for our country. You can see the front-runners are still conventional vaccines, which suggests that we don’t yet have enough training in (applying) new technologies,” Dong said, referring to the gene-based vaccines widely used by U.S. biotech companies. “For us, this is an opportunity.” While China’s pharmaceutical companies have been heavily focused on traditional design approaches, such as inactivated and vector-based vaccines, international competitors have been exploring novel mechanisms such as gene-based vaccines. According to the WHO, 10 out of the 35 candidates that have reached human trials are DNA or RNA vaccines. The first U.S. vaccine candidate to undergo human trials is an RNA vaccine from Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna, developed nearly simultaneously with CanSino’s vaccine in March. Although no gene-based vaccine has been approved yet in any country, this model can reduce production time tremendously by “outsourcing” some of the time-consuming steps required under traditional methods to the human recipient’s body.  Developing a successful vaccine has historically been a long and arduous process, taking several years to a decade or more. But in confronting the coronavirus crisis, the world’s scientists have been working at warp speed. Experts are cautioning, however, of the risk of a dangerous phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) that has been observed in some types of coronaviruses. While the precise mechanism is unclear, ADE occurs when antibodies — the virus-fighting immune response induced by the vaccine — betray their mission and aid the virus instead. In such cases, the vaccine actually exacerbates the infection.  Doctors have observed ADE in SARS vaccine trials in monkeys, as well as in vaccines against a coronavirus found in cats. Despite these viruses being closely related to the COVID-19 virus, no cases of ADE have been reported from any of the ongoing vaccine trials. “We’ve never had a vaccine for a human coronavirus before, so we can’t tell whether the (COVID-19) vaccines will lead to ADE,” Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a group interview at the Shenzhen summit. He added that inactivated vaccines — including those China is developing to stop the novel coronavirus — carry a higher risk of ADE compared with gene-based ones. Inactivated vaccines comprise more complex ingredients that can potentially induce a wide range of antibodies. And because scientists don’t know which antibodies cause ADE, there’s a higher chance of hitting the bull’s-eye with an inactivated vaccine. “When you don’t have a choice, you get the inactivated vaccine. When better vaccines are ready in a few years, you’ll get the better ones,” Gao said, stressing the need for accelerated biomedical innovation. Though Gao himself was inoculated with an unspecified experimental vaccine back in July, when he thought he “might need to go to the front lines,” he recommends that healthy, not-at-risk people wait until a vaccine candidate is demonstrated to be safe and effective during phase 3 trials. “It’s a balance between benefit and risk that we’re measuring,” he said. “Emergency use should be applied to the people who need it the most.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006176
Experimental COVID-19 Vaccines Given to Hundreds of Thousands of Chinese,"Medical workers, border inspectors, members of the military, staff at transport hubs, and Huawei employees have all had access to domestically developed vaccines that are still undergoing clinical trials.",2020-09-08,"Hundreds of thousands of people have taken an experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by China National Biotec Group (CNBG) in the past two months, including Chinese subjects not enrolled in clinical trials, CNBG said. China’s drug regulator authorized three experimental coronavirus vaccines for emergency use among those in high-risk groups such as medical workers, pandemic response officials, border inspection agents, and members of the military, though the final trials to prove that the vaccines are safe and effective are still underway. China officially launched the emergency-use program in July, but certain state-owned companies started having their employees take the vaccine as early as June, workers told Caixin. CNBG, China’s leading coronavirus vaccine developer, said its product has proved to be safe and to have good immunogenicity in various animal tests, and the vaccine has obtained clinical study approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration, according to an informed consent form for emergency vaccination viewed by Caixin. Now, emergency use of the vaccines is expanding. China’s civil aviation authorities recently provided vaccines for frontline workers at airlines and airports. Zheng Zhongwei, the head of China’s coronavirus vaccine task force, said the government is considering expanding the emergency program to cover transport industry officials, workers at produce markets, and service staff. A COVID-19 vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech Ltd., a Nasdaq-listed Chinese vaccine developer, was also approved for emergency use. Yin Weidong, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, told Reuters that 90% of its 3,000 or so employees and their families have been inoculated with the company’s vaccine candidate even though it hasn’t completed late-stage trials.  The hundreds of thousands of vaccine recipients can provide valuable data for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of vaccine candidates, but this data can’t be used as the basis for approving commercial application, said Yin, who added that he, his wife, and his parents have all received the vaccine. Sinovac is currently conducting Phase III trials in Brazil and Indonesia. In an interview with Chinese state-owned television, Yu Xuefeng, the chairman and CEO of CanSino Biologics, another Chinese vaccine developer included in the emergency-use program, said commercial use must be supported by effective data from Phase III clinical trials. China has been a global leader in the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines, contributing five of the nine vaccines that have reached late-stage Phase III trials. About 135 vaccine candidates are under development worldwide. Among them, about 10% use a traditional approach employing a weakened or inactive form of the virus, as does the CNBG candidate. Starting in June, more than 1,000 employees of a Beijing-based state-owned company voluntarily received the CNBG vaccine, an employee of the Beijing company told Caixin. The person said he received the injection after the employer had repeatedly called for volunteers. The company requires all expatriate workers to take the vaccine before they can leave China, the person said. Several other companies, including state-owned and private companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., have started providing vaccines to staff, mostly to expatriate workers, according to employees at the companies. CNBG said its vaccine was developed by a Beijing-based unit. According to publicly released progress reports, the vaccine was still in early phases of clinical safety trials when it started to be put into use. On April 27, the vaccine was tested in Shangqiu, a city in the central Henan province. On June 28, the company disclosed preliminary trial results showing that all participants produced antibodies against the COVID-19 virus within 28 days of receiving two doses of the vaccine. Although Phase I/II clinical trials show that a vaccine induces neutralizing antibody responses, that’s not enough to prove it effectively protects patients, experts said. Another informed consent form for emergency vaccination viewed by Caixin emphasizes that due to differences among recipients’ immune systems, it cannot be ruled out that certain people may not receive immune protection from the vaccine. As with any other vaccine, the informed consent form listed common reactions that may occur after injection with the COVID-19 vaccine, including fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and lethargy. The employee of the state-owned company said recipients of the CNBG vaccine are required to report only fever. CNBG said it signed agreements with Huawei and Phoenix Television, a partially state-owned television network, to provide resources and service support for routine and emergency vaccinations. CNBG is conducting Phase III trials abroad, including in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Peru, Morocco, and Argentina. Scientists said they aren’t sure how effectively these experimental vaccines can protect people from coronavirus infection. “Since there’s no proven vaccine yet, any candidate that can help us prevent and control the pandemic is necessary,” said Xiong Sidong, president of Soochow University and director of the Institute of Biology and Medical Sciences. The World Health Organization has warned that widespread immunization against COVID-19 may not be in the cards until the middle of next year.

The Silent Victims of China-India Travel Bans: Cancer Patients,Thousands of Chinese living with cancer rely on medication produced in India. But this lifeline is now under threat.,2020-09-02,"When the mail arrived last Thursday, Ying Junjing nearly wept with relief: She was safe — for another few months, at least. The 43-year-old has been living with chronic leukemia for two decades. To maintain her health, she relies on regular shipments of imatinib — a targeted drug developed by the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis and sold under the brand name Glivec. But over recent months, the deliveries have become increasingly unreliable. Now, when Ying orders a fresh batch of imatinib, she’s unsure when — or whether — the vital medication will be dispatched. “It used to take a week to 10 days for the drugs to arrive,” Ying tells Sixth Tone. “But after the pandemic broke out, things became unpredictable — it could be over a month, or completely unclear.”  The problem is that Ying buys the drugs from a company in India, which sells a generic version of imatinib at a fraction of the price charged by Chinese suppliers. For thousands of Chinese cancer patients, importing pills from South Asia is the only way to afford potentially life-saving drugs. Through 2020, however, travel restrictions between China and India have thrown this enormous drug trade into chaos. And the situation shows little sign of improving amid tense relations between the two countries. Before her package arrived last week, Ying had less than a month’s supply of imatinib left. Many other leukemia patients she knows are in even worse positions. “I’m really lucky,” says Ying. “Few of the patients in our chat group have received drug deliveries from India. Many placed their orders long before me — in July.” It’s unclear exactly how many people in China buy cancer medication from India, but anecdotal evidence suggests the number is in the hundreds of thousands at least. He Xiaobing, CEO of Beijing Memorial Pharmaceutical, a Chinese firm that specializes in coordinating clinical trials, has 14 years of experience dealing with cancer patients in the Chinese and Indian markets. He tells Sixth Tone demand for India-produced drugs among Chinese patients is enormous, especially among those with liver cancer, prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, renal carcinoma, and chronic granulocytic leukemia — the condition from which Ying suffers. Each year, around 500,000 people in China are diagnosed with liver cancer alone. He estimates around half of them use generic drugs for treatment. The situation is similar with patients of many other conditions, he adds. Chinese patients buy off-patent medication from several sources, including domestic manufacturers, but India — the world’s largest producer of generic drugs — is a major supplier. When discussing treatment options, many in China simply refer to nonbranded products as “Indian drugs.”  A black market for made-in-India pills first emerged in China due to the massive gap in drug prices between the two countries. For many Chinese families, the increased availability of cheaper overseas medication was life-changing. Ying was diagnosed with leukemia in her early 20s, just as Novartis was bringing Glivec to the Chinese market. The exciting new treatment, however, cost 23,500 yuan ($2,800) per month — far beyond what Ying’s family could afford. For the next decade, Ying’s parents managed to keep their daughter supplied with Glivec thanks to assistance from a nonprofit called the China Charity Federation, which subsidized 75% of the treatment costs. But the 70,000 yuan annual expense was an enormous drain on the family, who lives in a small county in the eastern Zhejiang province. “This was a big burden for my parents,” says Ying. “After my diagnosis in 2000, I didn’t work for an entire decade and lived with the support of my parents, who were average wage earners in our small county. In the early years, I frequently suffered from headaches and fevers — I wasn’t able to pick up any kind of job.” In 2013, Ying’s condition worsened. Her doctor advised the family to increase her dosage of Glivec, but they couldn’t afford the extra pills. It was then that Ying decided to explore the possibility of buying medication from India. “My trust in Indian generic drugs came from chatting with other patients in a QQ group (an online messaging platform),” says Ying. “They had used them and shared their positive feedback.” A QQ contact passed Ying an email address. To order up to four boxes of imatinib, she just had to send a message with her address and requirements, and then wire the money. The cost was just $100 per box — less than one-tenth the price of Glivec in China.  Ying had no idea who the supplier was — she speaks little English — but the service worked like a charm. Within a week or two of placing the order, the imatinib would arrive via EMS, the cross-border express mail service. At the time, what Ying was doing was illegal. China labeled any unapproved pharmaceutical imports “fake drugs,” and those caught selling them were harshly punished — sometimes with long prison sentences. But many Chinese cancer patients didn’t care, and the market for Indian drugs flourished. Jin Ni, a resident of the eastern city of Taizhou, recalls speaking with many families in the hospital after her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009. “They were all using Indian drugs,” Jin tells Sixth Tone. She adds the targeted drug used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer — gefitinib — cost 15,000 yuan per month in China at the time. “It’s unaffordable for average Chinese families, no matter urban or rural.” Eventually, the Chinese government appeared to accept the benefits of generic drug imports and began to semi-legitimize the trade. In late 2019, China removed the “fake drugs” label from generic drugs widely available overseas and relaxed punishments for those caught distributing them. By this point, made-in-India drugs were flooding into China via two main channels. Many patients, including Ying, relied on EMS, which is cheaper and less closely monitored than commercial delivery services like DHL and UPS. Others relied on professional buyers — known as daigou in Chinese — to get packages across the border. “In seven years, I’d never encountered any difficulties accessing my drugs via EMS,” says Ying. “I was never required to provide any documents to any authority.”  But things have changed radically in 2020. As COVID-19 began to spread through China in February, India canceled the visas of Chinese citizens and stopped issuing new entry permits. A month later, China introduced its own travel ban preventing foreign citizens from entering the country. The visa restrictions cut off daigou services almost entirely, forcing most cancer patients to rely solely on EMS to obtain their medication. Express deliveries, however, have also been severely disrupted. Ying says she was forced to turn to fellow leukemia patients with large stocks of imatinib to supplement her own supplies during the first half of the year, due to the difficulty of obtaining boxes from India. Then, on July 23, India took the unprecedented step of removing China from its list of EMS delivery destinations, citing the limited availability of flights. The Indian authorities reversed the decision two weeks later, but the move unnerved many in China. Many patients are still waiting for packages to be shipped from India. “Patients are generally very anxious,” says He. “But as many keep one to three months’ worth of drugs at home, I haven’t heard about a patient running out of drugs yet.” Cancer drugs have become much cheaper and more readily available in China over recent years, but a large number of Chinese are still reliant on imported pills. In Ying’s home province of Zhejiang — one of the wealthiest in China — Glivec is now included in public insurance schemes that provide patients with up to an 85% subsidy. This has reduced the cost of the drug to 18,000 yuan per year or less for most patients. Even this price, however, is too much for some patients. And many Chinese provinces can’t afford to provide patients with such a high level of remuneration on drug costs.  According to He, most of the patients using Indian drugs he has encountered are elderly and based in rural areas, where income levels are lower than in the cities. “They’re heavily dependent on their children to pay for these drugs,” says He. “They won’t have much spare money to spend on purchasing more drugs for future use.” Ying is fortunate enough to be able to switch to branded drugs if necessary. As her condition has stabilized, she has started working at a local hospital, earning up to 5,000 yuan per month. But she’s reluctant to pay more for her medication. “My parents sacrificed a lot due to my disease ... It’s cost my parents almost their entire life savings,” says Ying. “If I can save some money, I’d like to spend it on improving their lives.” She’s also hesitant about switching drug suppliers for health reasons. This year, her condition has remained stable. But for chronic granulocytic leukemia patients, there’s always a risk that a genetic mutation could cause a sudden acceleration in the disease. “The Indian medicines have worked on me very well,” says Ying. “I don’t dare just change to another brand.” Unless the travel disruptions ease, patients may be left with no choice. According to Ying, most of the leukemia patients she knows are running out of supplies.  For now, Ying continues to order fresh batches of pills via email. Others, however, are exploring alternative channels, such as agencies that claim to have large stocks of cancer drugs stored in Chinese warehouses. One agency reached by Sixth Tone says the firm bought large quantities of drugs from Natco Pharma — a major Indian pharmaceutical firm — before India suspended its EMS services to China. It charges less than 500 yuan per box of imatinib — even less than the price Ying pays. “It took up to 35 days for them to arrive; now it takes almost forever,” says a staff member from the agency. “If you don’t trust us, you can find a lab to test the ingredients before you take them.” He Xiaobing, however, urges patients to exercise caution when buying from daigou. Given the unpredictable situation, it’s likely the number of counterfeit drugs on the market will rise. “Patients should stay alert whenever a daigou service promises to send them Indian generic drugs,” He says. “Fake generic drugs exist in both India and China.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006136
China’s Childhood Myopia Rates Worsened During the Pandemic,An official from the Ministry of Education attributes the alarming rise to increased screen time after schools were forced to shift to online learning.,2020-08-28,"China’s Ministry of Education on Thursday reported an 11.5% rise in the country’s childhood myopia rate over the first half of this year. The surge is likely a result of increased screen time from online learning after schools across the country canceled classes in the spring due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Wang Dengfeng, a ministry official, said at a press conference that the myopia rate among elementary schoolers in China increased by over 15%, the highest among all levels of schooling. For comparison, the myopia rate among surveyed senior high schoolers — 10th through 12th graders — rose by less than 4%. The discrepancy is mostly because many high schoolers were already nearsighted before the pandemic, leaving “little room for an increase,” Wang said. In-class education came to a halt in China when the coronavirus began spreading throughout the country early this year. Since then, most schools have turned to online classes, which resulted in students becoming glued to their phones, tablets, and computers for hours at a time. According to Wang, the upward-trending myopia rates correlate positively with screen time and negatively with time spent outdoors. China has one of the highest rates of childhood myopia in the world. According to official statistics from 2018, more than half of the country’s minors are nearsighted, including 81% of senior high schoolers. And the rates are only growing. To combat the problem, the Ministry of Education, together with seven other central government agencies, launched an action plan two years ago. Through measures such as reducing students’ workloads, limiting play time for video games, and ensuring regular physical exercise, authorities have sought to lower child myopia rates by 0.5% annually over the next decade.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006117
China Started ‘Emergency Use’ of COVID-19 Vaccine in July: Report,"High-priority individuals, including medical professionals and workers from essential industries, are already eligible to be inoculated against the novel coronavirus.",2020-08-24,"China has authorized the “emergency use” of a domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine, a top health official said Saturday. Zheng Zhongwei, the National Health Commission official leading China’s coronavirus vaccine task force, said in an interview Saturday with state broadcaster CCTV that the commission began applying for emergency use approval on April 4. China’s Cabinet, the State Council, then approved an action plan on June 24, and the vaccine was officially implemented for emergency use beginning July 22, he added. Though the media report did not elaborate on which vaccine Zheng was referring to, China currently has two vaccine candidates undergoing late-stage human trials. Sinopharm, a state-affiliated pharmaceutical company, launched large-scale human trials in the United Arab Emirates in June. The same month, Sinovac, another Chinese vaccine maker, announced their own clinical trial program in Brazil. Both companies have gone overseas for clinical trials amid dwindling COVID-19 cases in China. The purpose of introducing the vaccine on an emergency basis is to “build immune barriers” among medical workers and key staff to ensure that cities continue to function normally, Zheng said. He added that the scope of emergency use might be expanded in order to prevent a potential rebound in autumn or winter. Last week, Sinopharm projected that China’s first vaccine against the novel coronavirus would be available to the public in December at a cost of up to 1,000 yuan ($145). In Saturday’s news segment, Zheng suggested that the price of such a vaccine would likely be lower than initially estimated.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006096
The Show Must Go On: How Cirque du Soleil Survived China’s Lockdown,"For the Canadian firm’s newest troupe, keeping the show running through 2020 has been a monumental challenge — especially as several key acrobats are stuck outside China.",2020-08-21,"ZHEJIANG, East China — Even by circus standards, the past 12 months have been a wild ride for Cirque du Soleil’s newest troupe. Last August, the Canadian entertainment company launched its first resident show in Asia in years — a lavish production titled “X: The Land of Fantasy” — in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. At the time, the premiere appeared to herald the start of a new era for Cirque, whose global showbiz empire already encompassed over 40 shows. China’s live events market was booming, surpassing 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) for the first time in 2019. Foreign franchises from “Mamma Mia!” to “Cats” were filling arenas across the country. Then, COVID-19 happened.  The global lockdowns decimated the entertainment industries in China and across the world. By March, Cirque du Soleil had halted its entire roster of shows and laid off over 90% of its staff. Its Chinese adventure appeared to be on shaky ground. Yet, somehow, the company’s new Hangzhou-based show has survived. It’s now one of only two Cirque productions operating worldwide. The improbable feat owes much to the deep pockets of “X”’s Chinese backers, but also to the ingenuity of its cast. With key artists stranded overseas, the troupe faced a herculean task keeping the show on the road. Curtain Falls Acrobat He Guowei still recalls the anxiety he felt on Jan. 23, when word began to spread through the troupe that the creative director was calling an emergency meeting after that night’s show. Up to that point, there had been no indication “X” was in trouble. Over the previous months, He had performed over 100 shows to a total of nearly 100,000 spectators. The high-tech arena specially built to host the circus act in downtown Hangzhou had attracted good crowds nearly every night.  What’s more, “X” had always been designed as a long-term project. Cirque had been meticulously planning a new China base for years, opening talks with its local partner — real estate group Hangzhou Xintiandi — about a co-production as early as 2015. The two sides had left nothing to chance. Xintiandi — which acted as the show’s investor, owner, and operations manager — oversaw the creation of a giant new venue to host the performances. Converted from a machinery factory in downtown Hangzhou, the state-of-the-art auditorium features a 100-meter-long stage and two seating areas, each capable of rotating 360 degrees. In 2018, He had been hired along with a troupe of acrobats from the northern city of Tianjin. To prepare for their new roles, Cirque flew the Chinese performers to its Montreal headquarters, where they underwent three months of training. “We learned a lot over there, from music to performance and creativity,” says He. “And our individual understanding of art really developed, too.” After their return, they joined a team of over 200 people — about one-third of whom were non-Chinese — that created the new show together over the first eight months of 2019. “X: The Land of Fantasy” was carefully crafted to blend Chinese elements into Cirque’s time-tested creative formula. The 75-minute performance followed the story of two heroes as they tried to bring about peace between their warring kingdoms, interspersed with battle scenes, operatic singing, and high-wire action. And it seemed to work. Dressed as a “shadow warrior” — one of many dark, ninja-like henchmen who pursue the story’s heroes — He recalls the elation he felt on opening night as he emerged from a pit in the stage floor before 1,500 spectators. “In my mind’s eye, I could see all those Cirque videos I’d seen before, flashing before me. But now, it was me in the frame,” says the 32-year-old, who started training to be an acrobat at the age of 12. “It was really like a dream come true.”  But as soon as the director started speaking after the January show, He and his colleagues realized this dream was under threat. The director said the Chinese government had issued a total ban on live performances to curb the spread of a novel coronavirus, which had emerged in the central city of Wuhan a few weeks earlier. Cirque’s entire run of shows was called off indefinitely, with the expectation that the ban would last until at least mid-February. Across China, this ban would ultimately cause over 20,000 live shows to be delayed or cancelled during the first three months of the year. The same day, Wuhan — a sprawling metropolis of 11 million people — was dramatically locked down, with all buses, trains, and cars prevented from entering or leaving the city.  He recalls feeling shell-shocked after the meeting. It was the day before Lunar Near Year's Eve — a major holiday in China, akin to Christmas in the West, when families traditionally gather. Yet the acrobat was stranded 1,200 kilometers from his hometown in northern China, uncertain what was about to happen. “We were very low and fearful,” He tells Sixth Tone. “We didn’t have a clue what the virus was going to be like … and how long it would go on for.” For the next two months, He found himself trapped in his apartment with two other acrobats. They only went outside once a week to stock up on food. The performers didn’t know whether the show would ever resume, but they still needed to keep up an intense physical training regime. In one scene in “X,” He is required to lie at the bottom of a huge human tower, holding up four men with just his legs. “What we do isn’t like other jobs, where when you’re resting, you can completely relax at home and do nothing,” says He. “We had to maintain our physiques at home, but we had no idea how long we’d be doing it, or what it was all for.” Unable to go outside due to Hangzhou’s strict lockdown rules, the acrobats had to get creative. In the absence of weights, they lifted each other. In the living room, they recreated a miniature version of the human tower, with He lying at the bottom and holding up the other two with his legs. These training sessions had to be done in the morning, otherwise the neighbors would complain about the noise, He says.  Meanwhile, foreign troupe members including Mathieu Chouinard — a Canadian actor who plays a sage-like character named The Watcher in “X” — had scattered across the world. Initially, Chouinard says he didn’t realize how serious the virus was, figuring it couldn’t be much worse than a seasonal flu outbreak. But in February, he decided to hole up in Thailand, to avoid being affected by Hangzhou’s tightening lockdown policies. It was only in March — as COVID-19 began to spread globally and live events companies including Cirque announced dramatic cutbacks — that he realized the show might be under threat. “When it spread worldwide, it became a real question of, ‘OK, are we still going to have jobs in two weeks?’” says Chouinard. “It really felt like the world was changing … Performing arts was changing.” Still unsure whether “X” would survive, but seeing that China seemed to be getting the virus under control, Chouinard flew back to Hangzhou in March. His timing was perfect: Just two weeks later, China closed its borders to foreign nationals. Picking Up the Pieces By April, life in Chinese cities appeared to be returning to normal — albeit with mandatory face mask-wearing. Wuhan had finally reopened, and the country’s bars and nightclubs were thumping once more. Theatrical shows like Cirque, however, were still firmly shut down. Xia Xiaoyu, Xintiandi’s general manager, spent weeks in daily contact with the district government and local tourism bureau throughout this period, trying to secure authorization for “X” to resume performances.  According to Xia, local officials were very concerned about the welfare of the show — a project they hoped would be a long-term asset for Hangzhou’s already vibrant tourism sector. But a reboot required permission from China’s higher authorities. On May 12, the national government edict finally arrived, allowing shows to open across the country provided they adhere to strict virus-control measures. Xia immediately sent over an application to the authorities, and the circus got the green light to open its doors. For the troupe, the return to work felt surreal. All employees were required to wear masks and have their temperatures checked on arrival. The whole auditorium was disinfected twice daily and its ventilation systems altered to stop air being recycled. Attendance levels were capped at 50%.  These were necessary inconveniences, but the virus would also have a major impact on the show’s content. In an opening routine, happy “villagers” — including a fisher with a giant octopus draped over one shoulder — run amok among the audience and perform magic tricks for individual spectators. But such interactions had to be scrapped for safety reasons. Far more seriously, 22 of the show’s 28 foreign performers — many of whom were experts in highly specialized skills that take years to master — were still stuck abroad due to China’s border restrictions. These travel bans have forced several touring productions to delay or cancel their runs, including a Korean-produced version of the musical “Jekyll & Hyde.” But for Hangzhou Cirque, the show would go on. The crew, however, faced a daunting task getting ready for the circus’s big reopening on June 3. Around 50% of the show’s content needed to be remade, according to acrobat He. Over a manic three-week period, “X” hired over a dozen replacement actors and acrobats from troupes across China, who had to be trained and taught the show in its entirety. Scenes containing foreign stars were replaced and re-choreographed. A duo of figure-skating Russians was swapped out for a group of Cyr wheel performers, who roll around the stage inside giant metal hoops. The high-flying bungee rope artists were substituted for a “water meteor” juggling act. Local trampoline specialists created a simplified version of the show’s original “trampowall” segment, in which the experienced foreign artists would flip and spin off of a high vertical wall. Changing or cutting acts is routine during Cirque shows, but making so many changes while remaining faithful to the “X” storyline was a huge challenge, according to Chouinard. “The show was built with a plot and a storyline,” he says. “The acts themselves have meaning in the heroes’ journeys.”  The hardest-working crewmembers were the technical team, who had to adjust the music, graphics, lighting, and animations to fit with the altered show. Each change, meanwhile, had to be discussed and approved by Cirque’s headquarters back in Canada. “It was almost like a new creation,” says Chouinard. “It was a tremendous amount of work, but people stuck together and helped.” Finally, 130 days after it had been shut down, “X” gave its first performance to a special audience of Chinese medical workers and other staff who had served on the front lines during the COVID-19 crisis. For He, the reopening felt nearly as emotional as the premiere, the months of effort and training in isolation finally paying off. “I felt excited and really moved,” says He. “I felt my efforts over those two months hadn’t been wasted, and the anti-virus measures had succeeded.” An Uncertain Future Since July 8, the troupe has returned to performing 21 shows per month, just as it did before the virus. Yet the show remains under huge financial pressure. The Hangzhou show was created at enormous expense. In media interviews, Xia has claimed the production costs for “X” were 50% higher than similar shows in China, as Cirque insists on everything being of the highest quality and sourced from vendors of their choice. Between February and June, Xintiandi continued to pay staff wages, venue bills, financial payments, and maintenance costs, without earning 1 yuan in income. The Chinese firm, meanwhile, still has to pay Cirque an annual licensing fee for the show. When Sixth Tone spoke with Xia in July, she said the company was currently negotiating this year’s payment with its Canadian partner, with a slight grimace. The deep pockets of Xintiandi have enabled the show to absorb these losses, but the current 50% attendance limit means the show can’t run profitably. Even if the cap is lifted, it’s possible “X” could be affected by the wider economic headwinds buffeting China, Xia admits. Hangzhou is one of China’s top tourist destinations, but visitor numbers have plummeted this year.  Then, there’s the uncertainty surrounding Cirque du Soleil itself. In late June, the company officially filed for bankruptcy protection. It has since reached an agreement with creditors providing $900 million in debt forgiveness and $375 million in new financing, and this week Canadian private equity firm Capital Catalyst Group succeeded in winning control of the company. As it’s owned by Xintiandi, “X” has been shielded from this turmoil. The show recently celebrated its one-year anniversary with an outdoor circus carnival in Hangzhou. But Xia says the company still needs to find new sources of income. Over recent months, Xintiandi has begun renting out the “X” auditorium for events. The arena has already hosted a press event for the Chinese car brand Geely, a taping of the reality TV show “Go Fighting!” starring Angelababy, and a children’s theater production. The troupe is also exploring ways to repackage the show’s content to sell to other entertainment venues, such as Xintiandi’s holiday resorts.  Yet over the long term, the show’s survival will likely depend on China’s live events market finally recovering from its post-coronavirus depression. Wei Jiayi, who runs a media and consulting firm focused on China’s theater industry, says the 50% attendance cap is preventing most Chinese shows from reopening. High theater rental costs mean most shows need at least 60% of seats to be occupied to make a profit. Chouinard, however, says he remains optimistic. For him, nothing can replace the magic of live performance, and so the sector is sure to bounce back eventually. “Yes, performing arts will have to adapt, and these kinds of big shows will also have to adapt,” he says. “But there’s been no time in the history of mankind when there was no performance. We always find a way.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006086
A Taoist’s Quest to Memorialize China’s COVID-19 Martyrs,"The author, a Taoist priest, has set up over 550 memorial tablets to those killed in the country’s fight against the coronavirus.",2020-08-21,"On July 29, I saw in a news report that Wang Younong had died. A Shanghai port executive, Wang collapsed on the job this April after working eight consecutive days and nights to coordinate the safe return of the Royal Caribbean cruise liner Quantum of the Seas and its 353 Chinese crew members. After 75 days in a coma, he died on July 11. I decided to make a memorial tablet in his honor. Wang’s was the 546th of 552 such tablets I’ve made in remembrance of the heroes who’ve died in China’s fight against COVID-19. I’m a Taoist priest. When China’s COVID-19 epidemic first broke out in Wuhan this January, religious sites and places of worship across the country all shut their doors — and I abruptly found myself with significantly more free time on my hands. Still hoping to contribute, on Jan. 29 I traveled from my mountainside monastery to my residence in Xi’an to pick up my bank card and make a donation. That same day, I read an article saying a doctor named Mao Yanghong had died in the line of duty. The deputy dean of a health center in southeastern China, he had been working at a local pandemic checkpoint when he was struck and killed by a vehicle. I was shocked by his death. After a quick online search, I found he was far from the only lost hero.  In an effort to commemorate and honor those who died for our sakes, I turned to Taoism, setting up memorial tablets for those who had sacrificed their lives in China’s battle against the virus. Taoists make memorial tablets, inscribed with an individual’s name and background, to give souls a place to rest after death. We believe those sanctified in a memorial tablet don’t just linger on; a bit like Catholic saints, they help protect us, too. In a way, those who lost their lives in the fight against COVID-19 are China’s saints. On Jan. 29, I set up my first three tablets, one each to honor Mao Yanghong, Jiang Jijun, and He Jianhua. Jiang Jijun was a doctor specializing in infectious diseases at Taizhou People’s Hospital in the eastern Jiangsu province. He suffered a fatal heart attack as a result of rushing back and forth between the inpatient wards and the fever clinic. He Jianhua, a police chief in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, died from a sudden brain hemorrhage while working at the county bus terminal. Once I had set up the three tablets, I took a photo and posted it on microblogging site Weibo, accompanied by the following caption: “We will remember you. I hope that you will continue to protect the people of China from up high in heaven and that no other frontline workers will lose their lives!” That last prayer wasn’t answered. Instead, my collection of memorial tablets grew at an alarming pace. On Feb. 7, I inscribed the name of Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who helped blow the whistle on the emerging pandemic. His was my monastery’s 42nd tablet. We originally had prepared just 10 tablets for those who died in the fight against the virus. Over time, this number grew to 30, then 100, 200, 500. By the time the outbreak reached its peak in China, we had run out of wooden tablets and had to resort to yellow cards. When we ran out of those, we used white cards. We wouldn’t be able to start using wooden tablets again until things slowed down. Most of those we’ve memorialized are not as famous as Li Wenliang. Some were security guards, others volunteers, teachers, or village doctors. The news of their deaths goes largely unnoticed — it is a mere drop in the ocean of information inundating our screens. In many cases, their obituaries can only be found on the official public accounts of town governments, with only a few dozen views each. It can take us half a month or even longer to confirm the information we need. Sometimes, the family and friends of those who died on duty come to us directly. In that case, we have to verify what they tell us. On the final tablet, in addition to these martyrs’ names, we also note details such as their place of residence and employment; their hometown; their gender; and the circumstances and date of their death. Getting in touch with the family members of the deceased is by far the most heartbreaking step of the process. Zhou Zongde — our 278th tablet — was a technician at Tianyou Hospital in Wuhan. He died after contracting COVID-19 while working. His family members told me they never had the chance to visit him in the intensive care unit or even see his face one last time before he died. They said their hearts pang every time they think of him being sent for cremation in his old work clothes. I’ve enshrined each tablet in the hall of Jiuyang Palace, a monastery in the eastern Shandong province where I am the honorary abbot. Every day, we dust them off, tidy up their surroundings, light candles, lay out fresh fruit as offerings, and recite scriptures that will keep their souls at peace.  Every time I finish a new tablet, I post a new message on Weibo. While I’ve received a lot of support and encouragement for what I do, there have also been doubts and even accusations. For example, some netizens question whether the sacrifice of these people was worth it. Were their deaths really a price that had to be paid in order to control the outbreak? But the question that makes my heart ache the most is: How can there be so many people on my list who died of exhaustion? Why couldn’t they just take a break at some point? The fact is, of the more than 500 people for whom I’ve made tablets, only a few died from complications of COVID-19. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the cause of death was overwork. They were absolutely unrelenting in their efforts to protect our country. Only when they couldn’t physically stand up any longer did they surrender to a sleep from which they’d never wake up. It amazes me that some people still don’t understand the stakes, the scope of this tragedy. Don’t they realize China’s fight against the coronavirus is not a job, but a war? Would we blame a deceased soldier for not dodging the bullet that killed them? In the past couple of months, as the pandemic has gradually faded from public consciousness in China, many people have suggested I can stop updating the list. I remain stubborn, however. Until the day the coronavirus is completely eliminated, I will neither stop keeping count of the lives lost, nor making tablets in their honor. I don’t want to leave anyone out. I don’t want their names to be erased. We should remember them, remember what they did for us, and carry our gratitude forward.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006075
"China Will Have a COVID-19 Vaccine by Year’s End, Sinopharm Says","The head of the state-owned pharmaceutical company said a vaccination course could cost up to 1,000 yuan, but whether it will be covered by the government remains unclear.",2020-08-19,"Update: According to a Sept. 21 report by the South China Morning Post, the vice president of China National Biotec Group, another leading pharmaceutical company, said its two-dose coronavirus vaccine was being reviewed by the state drug regulator, and if approved would be sold to the public for 600 yuan or less. A leading Chinese pharmaceutical group has projected that the country’s first vaccine against the novel coronavirus will be made available to the public in December, the state-run newspaper Guangming Daily reported Tuesday. Liu Jingzhen, the chairman of China National Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd., or Sinopharm, said phase 3 trials of a domestically developed coronavirus vaccine were launched June 23 in the United Arab Emirates. “Upon completion of phase 3 trials, the vaccine will enter the approval channel. It will be made accessible at the end of December,” Liu said, adding that annual production capacities at the biological products institutes in Beijing and Wuhan — two of China’s major vaccine producers— are 120 million and 100 million doses, respectively. According to Liu, one injection with the vaccine will have a protection rate of 97%, with the human body needing around half a month to develop antibodies to fight the virus. But if a person receives two shots 28 days apart, the protection rate can approach 100%, Liu said. Liu himself has been injected with the coronavirus vaccine twice, and says he didn’t experience side effects. He emphasized, however, that the vaccine may not be essential for the entire population. “It’s necessary for students and workers in densely populated cities,” he said. “But if you live in sparsely populated rural areas, you can skip the shots.” Liu estimated that one course of the vaccine, or two injections, will cost up to 1,000 yuan ($145). While China provides so-called category A vaccines — such as those against hepatitis B, diphtheria, and tetanus — free of charge to all citizens, it remains unclear whether the COVID-19 vaccine will be covered by the national free vaccination plan.  “It’s definitely not cheap if you have to pay entirely out of pocket,” Mo Yingying, a 41-year-old office worker in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “But if it’s safe and effective, I’ll still go for it.” However, Zhuo Yueying, 75, says a 1,000 yuan price tag would be prohibitively expensive for pensioners like her who receive around 3,000 yuan a month. “The virus poses the biggest threat to the elderly. I hope the government will prioritize free shots for older people living in heavily populated cities,” she told Sixth Tone. Insiders fear that asking individuals to foot the bill will lower the national vaccination rate. “I’m worried this price won’t be enough to guarantee a high vaccination rate, making it harder to achieve herd immunity,” Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert, wrote on microblogging platform Weibo. “If another large-scale outbreak were to happen in the country, the government would probably take further measures,” Tao wrote. “However, given the current low incidence rate (of coronavirus infection), it’s acceptable to make the vaccine voluntary and require people to pay for it on their own.” Earlier this month, Russia became the first country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine. The country is preparing to start a mass vaccination drive in October, and shots will be free. As COVID-19 vaccine research continues worldwide at a frenetic pace and several candidates enter phase 3 clinical trials, countries are starting to settle on vaccination policies. On Wednesday, Australia announced that citizens would be eligible to receive a University of Oxford-developed vaccine for free.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006071
China’s Largest Farmers Market Reopens After Beijing Outbreak,"For the first time since the Chinese capital’s coronavirus outbreak was traced there in June, Xinfadi market has partially reopened with ramped-up public health measures.",2020-08-15,"BEIJING — After being closed for two months due to concerns of coronavirus transmission, China’s largest farmers market partially reopened at 8 a.m. Saturday. Stalls south of the railway line bisecting Xinfadi, Beijing’s sprawling 112-hectare wholesale market, have resumed operation, while the other half of the complex is expected to reopen by Sept. 10, Zhou Xinchun, the deputy head of Beijing’s Fengtai District, said at a press conference Thursday. Xinfadi was completely shut down on June 13, two days after a 52-year-old man who had shopped there was diagnosed with COVID-19.  Though Xinfadi has only just reopened, vendors like Liu Hongwei are already back to work in some of the open-air areas around the market that were cleaned and prepared for temporary stalls. “The pandemic has surely had some impact on me, but apart from the 14 days in quarantine, it was all right,” Liu told Sixth Tone while sorting cucumbers and waiting for his first customers. Others will have to be more patient. Zhang Kun won’t be making money from his stall for another three to five days because his honeydew melons are still en route from the eastern Shandong province. He was notified Monday about Xinfadi’s reopening and asked to wear a red vest with an ID number on it.  The “unluckiest” vendors are those who don’t sell fruits and vegetables, as they’re still waiting for permission to return to work. Frozen food vendor Chen Gensheng tested positive for the coronavirus on June 14 after being admitted to Tiantan Hospital with a fever. He suspects he contracted the virus from the underground seafood section of the market, across the street from his own section. When Beijing’s outbreak control workers swept through Xinfadi, Chen lost 200,000 yuan ($29,000) worth of goods. “My freezer was fully stocked,” he told Sixth Tone. “But someone else lost even more — over 1 million yuan (in goods) got thrown out,” he added, referring to a vendor who operates nearby. Despite the financial loss he suffered, Chen is more worried about the health risks of working in the market. China’s initial wave of COVID-19 earlier this year coincided with most businesses being shut down, but Xinfadi remained open as an essential artery supplying food to the city’s homes and restaurants. After spending the Lunar New Year holiday in his hometown in the neighboring Hebei province, Chen went back to work at Xinfadi almost immediately upon returning in early February — only to notice that the market didn’t seem to be doing much to guard against the disease. “They were just taking temperatures at the entrance, nothing else,” Chen said. This time is different. According to Zhou, the district official, Xinfadi has instituted several precautionary measures including controlling numbers by barring retailers and permitting wholesalers, requiring real-name registration and screening through a public account on social app WeChat, keeping underground or partially underground areas closed, and disinfecting the entire market once a week.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006062
Shanghai Reports 18 Coronavirus Cases Among Inbound Travelers,The cases — all passengers arriving from the UAE — tested positive during a mandatory two-week quarantine period.,2020-08-11,"Shanghai’s health authority on Monday reported 18 imported cases of COVID-19, the city’s highest single-day tally since mid-April. All 18 infections were among Chinese nationals who had arrived from the United Arab Emirates last week on two separate flights. They tested positive for coronavirus during the mandatory two-week quarantine period after landing in Shanghai. According to a reward and punishment system China’s aviation authority introduced in June, one of the two routes involved will be suspended for four weeks for having 15 infected passengers on board. In late July, Chinese authorities announced that all people traveling from international destinations would have to show negative COVID-19 tests before boarding the plane in a bid to further contain imported cases. It is unclear whether the two Shanghai-bound flights followed this protocol. Domestically, the northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has seen a surge in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks. As of Tuesday, Xinjiang had reported 567 symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 131 asymptomatic cases since mid-July.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006045
"14 Days Not Always Enough to Detect COVID-19, Study Suggests","Model shows up to 10% of patients may develop symptoms of the disease after the typical two-week quarantine window, but experts say this is no cause for alarm or policy changes.",2020-08-10,"Two-week quarantines may not be long enough to identify all people who are sick with COVID-19, according to study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. Currently, many countries including China, the U.S., and the U.K. impose a 14-day quarantine rule on anyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, such as people traveling from areas with high concentrations of COVID-19 cases. But a team led by researchers from Peking University found that up to 10% of infected people could have an incubation period — the time between exposure to the virus and developing symptoms — of over 14 days. “Policymakers may consider tweaking the 14-day quarantine rule, particularly when there’s a large number of cases,” Zhou Xiaohua, a co-author of the paper, told Sixth Tone. “During an outbreak, even 5% means a lot of infected people.” Zhou and his team studied 1,084 COVID-19 patients who left the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where cases of the disease were first reported, between Jan. 19 and Jan. 23, when the city was put under lockdown. None of the patients had shown symptoms before leaving Wuhan. They found that patients tend to carry the virus without showing symptoms for seven to eight days. Previous studies — most involving small samples — had estimated the virus’ incubation period to be four to five days. Moreover, the team found that 5-10% of cases might not show symptoms for over 14 days. “We may need to extend the quarantine period for people at high risk (of exposure),” Zhou said. Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone that people should not panic over this new piece of information. “An incubation period by definition will have outliers,” Shen said. “It’s not a unique problem with the coronavirus, but rather happens with most types of infections. So far, there isn’t enough evidence to change the quarantine policy for all suspected cases.” Previously, China had reported two isolated cases of COVID-19 with prolonged incubation periods of 27 and 38 days. “As a doctor, it’s important that we are aware of the issue,” Shen said. “But more importantly, we need to spend most of our time catching the 90% who fall within the normal range instead of fixating on the 10%.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006036
China Strengthens Marketplace Monitoring to Curb Viral Outbreaks,"Samples from the country’s farmers markets, including swabs from workers, will be collected and tested for coronavirus on a monthly or weekly basis.",2020-07-31,"China’s top health authority has made coronavirus tests mandatory for individuals working at food markets amid rising infections in parts of the country. In a guideline Thursday, the National Health Commission said that all farmers markets in the country will be “monitored” on a weekly or monthly basis depending on their size. Marketplaces selling meat and seafood, where live animals can often be purchased or slaughtered to order, have been back in the spotlight lately after a few coronavirus clusters were linked to such facilities. Health authorities will collect samples from surfaces, workers’ clothes and hands, freezers, meat and seafood, sewage, bathrooms, and garbage trucks at the markets and test them within 24 hours, the guideline said. In addition, aerosol samples from poorly ventilated places within the markets, such as enclosed offices, will also be sent for testing. Samples from large-scale farmers markets — especially those selling frozen or refrigerated meat and seafood — or markets with confined, humid spaces will be collected and tested once a week, according to the guideline. Meanwhile, smaller marketplaces will undergo the same process on a monthly basis. The new rule comes amid growing numbers of local coronavirus infections in several parts of China, including the northwestern Xinjiang region and the northeastern city of Dalian. As of Thursday, Dalian had reported 68 confirmed cases since July 22, mostly among employees of Dalian Kaiyang Seafood Company or their close contacts, while Xinjiang has reported 523 confirmed coronavirus infections since a fresh outbreak was detected July 16. Chinese authorities have been hyper-vigilant about possible viral outbreaks at farmers markets since a coronavirus cluster in Beijing was traced to Xinfadi, the country’s largest farmers market, in early June. The outbreak in the Chinese capital was quickly contained, though infections from Dalian were reported there this week. Last month, Chinese customs authorities began testing imported meat after the coronavirus was detected on a chopping board reportedly used for salmon at Xifandi market in Beijing. The same month, Shanghai also started conducting nucleic acid tests on the fresh meat, seafood, and surfaces of local supermarkets and produce wholesalers.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006005
"Missed Connections: The Struggle to Communicate, Post-Virus","After over a month hospitalized and hooked up to an artificial lung, Hu Dingjiang is finding it hard to open up.",2020-07-29,"This story is part of a visual series highlighting the first-hand experiences of those caught in the crossfires of the coronavirus epidemic in central city Wuhan. You can find part one here. HUBEI, Central China — Amid the hum of the ward’s medical equipment, a phone rings. A doctor answers and holds it in front of Hu Dingjiang, a COVID-19 patient who has been critically ill and bedridden more than 70 days. “Did he throw anything on the floor again?” asks Li Jiahui, Hu’s wife, on the phone. She’s responding to a message from the ICU informing her Hu had lost his temper again. “He tried to remove his stomach tube,” the doctor says. Hu listens as their conversation plays out. Every so often, Li coaxes her husband to react with a nod, a blink, anything. He doesn’t move. Near the end of the phone call, Hu finally blinks to respond to the doctor: Yes, he’d like to listen to relaxing music. As the wave-like tune washes over him, Hu’s eyes well with tears.  Hu, 40, was diagnosed with COVID-19 in early February. When his condition worsened, he was sent to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital in mid-March. For over a month, Hu was connected to an ECMO, or artificial lung, as medical personnel brought him back from the brink. At its peak, 70% of the ICU’s coronavirus patients were connected to ECMOs. The ICU saw 81 COVID-19 patients, with Hu one of the last ones left in the ward. “Hu has been in the hospital for so long,” resident ICU doctor Chen Yumei says. “He probably feels lonely without his family members’ company. This is a common problem among ICU patients.” Restoring his ability to communicate proves particularly challenging for the temperamental Hu. His anxiety is aggravated all the more by watching the ward’s other patients get transferred one by one. Hu slowly regains motion in his limbs, all while the city outside buzzes with life and traffic returns to the streets after Wuhan’s lockdown ends April 8. While the city outside Hu’s window reopens, Hu has more immediate concerns: unlocking his phone, a simple motion made strenuous because of damage to his cerebellum. The world inside his phone is so near, yet so far. But once Hu at last completes the necessary button presses, he drinks in all the messages before him. On June 17, Hu is finally discharged from the hospital — its last coronavirus patient. Li’s quit her job as a hotel staff member to take care of Hu. She remains optimistic, however, since the couple can now be in touch, with or without phones. “I just hope we can stay together,” Li says. “After all, I think life matters most.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005995
"In 2020, China’s Top Study Abroad Destination Is: China","As fears over coronavirus disruptions grow, Chinese international students are pressuring overseas universities to allow them to continue their studies in their home country.",2020-07-29,"When Wu Wenhao received an offer from New York University (NYU) in February, the 18-year-old thought he was about to begin a new life as an itinerant scholar. He planned to spend his first semester in northern Italy, before heading to New York after the winter vacation. Then the coronavirus hit Europe and changed everything. Now, the college freshman’s fall semester promises to be far less glamorous. When classes start in September, Wu won’t be in Florence; he’ll be at a WeWork in central Shanghai, just a 20-minute drive from his home. NYU has booked out swathes of the coworking space in the eastern Chinese city, which the university is hastily converting into makeshift classrooms and lecture halls. The new facilities will be used to accommodate thousands of local students unable or unwilling to travel to NYU or its Abu Dhabi campus for the new semester — a strategy the university has dubbed the Go Local plan.  It’s a radical response to the pandemic, but one that several Western universities are looking to follow as Chinese international students increasingly pressure colleges to let them continue their studies at home. For Wu, staying in China is far from ideal, but it’s better than attending online classes from a socially distanced dorm room on the other side of the world. “I’m not sure how things will go, but going local is my best option right now,” Wu tells Sixth Tone. “Although NYU offers online classes, I lack confidence in my ability to concentrate during those courses.” Many young Chinese feel the same way. China is the largest source of international students in the world, with more than 660,000 people leaving the country to study overseas in 2018. But the global disruptions brought on by COVID-19 are causing many to reassess their plans this year. Some students fear catching the virus if they travel to the United States or Europe. Others are reluctant to pay sky-high tuition fees for what they expect will be an inferior educational experience. Still others face practical obstacles such as the U.S. travel ban, which is forcing Chinese students to quarantine in a third country for 14 days before entering the United States. The prospect of a steep drop in Chinese student enrollment is causing Western colleges — many of which are heavily dependent on the income brought by international student fees — to take unprecedented steps to allow students to pursue their programs without leaving China. The NYU plan, announced mid-July, is the most ambitious. Once the temporary WeWork classrooms are complete, they’ll host an estimated 3,100 students — far more than the 1,700 currently attending NYU Shanghai, the school NYU runs in the city in partnership with East China Normal University.  Duke University also plans to allow around 125 students to spend the fall semester at the college it co-runs with a Chinese partner in eastern China, Duke Kunshan University (DKU). According to Scott MacEachern, DKU’s vice chancellor for academic affairs, the visiting students will share the same campus and classrooms as DKU’s own scholars. “We’ll welcome students in China back to the campus, and we’ll be teaching simultaneously online,” says MacEachern. “That degree of flexibility makes it easier for us to accommodate extra students this year.” Other U.S. colleges without a major presence in China, meanwhile, are partnering with local institutions to host international students. In July, Cornell University unveiled a “study away” program that would allow Chinese students to spend the fall semester at one of several elite domestic schools, including Peking and Tsinghua universities in Beijing. Rutgers University, Syracuse University, Trinity College, Tulane University, University of Pittsburgh, and several other U.S. colleges have also announced similar agreements with Chinese partners. The “go local” plans have been warmly welcomed by Chinese students like Matthew Liao, a rising sophomore at NYU’s College of Arts and Science. The student returned to China from New York in March and has since been attending online classes, but he tells Sixth Tone he’s been far from satisfied with the experience.  “I’m strongly against online courses as they lack a dynamic or interactive atmosphere,” says Liao. “They don’t provide opportunities for us to interact socially. There’s no campus feeling at all.” According to Liao, NYU first offered students the Go Local option in mid-May. It’s one of three choices the university’s Chinese scholars generally have — the other two being continuing with online classes or deferring a semester, he says. “Given the ongoing pandemic, there isn’t much you can do if you choose a gap semester,” says Liao. “Going local is the most acceptable plan at the moment.” But studying in China is far from a perfect solution, with many students expressing concern that the last-minute arrangement won’t provide the quality of education they would normally expect.  Liao says students are still waiting for answers to several key questions regarding the Go Local plan, such as who will teach the thousands of additional students and how the university will ensure students have access to the academic resources they need. For students who intended to go abroad, the lack of cultural diversity in all-Chinese classrooms is also a significant drawback. NYU Shanghai says it’s working to secure permission for its non-Chinese first-year students to enter the country, but for now China’s borders remain largely closed to foreign nationals. “Without students from diverse backgrounds, I’m worried students might have similar thoughts toward issues, especially for liberal arts subjects,” Chen Linglai, another NYU student on the Go Local program, tells Sixth Tone. Other students have noted the lack of courses available at NYU Shanghai, which has a far smaller faculty than the university’s campus in New York. One rising junior at NYU, who requested anonymity for privacy reasons, tells Sixth Tone she decided to continue with online learning due to the greater range of options available. “I’m a bit worried about being separated from my friends for a long time, but eventually I chose to stay online to learn my favorite courses,” she tells Sixth Tone. “I’m lucky enough to have some very dedicated professors. To adapt to the online format, they added more Q&A and one-on-one sessions, which helped a lot.” The issue most frequently cited by students considering the Go Local program, however, is the tuition fees. Like many Western universities, NYU has decided against offering international students a discount on their fees, despite the recent disruptions to teaching and academic life. That means the vast majority of NYU students on the Go Local program are still paying between $50,000 and $100,000 a year in tuition fees, depending on the credits they select. Students enrolled permanently at the NYU Shanghai campus a few blocks away, by contrast, are charged 120,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan ($17,150-$25,700) in annual fees.  Feng Jing, a fourth-year student at NYU, tells Sixth Tone she’s unhappy about having to pay such high fees when so many of the courses she wishes to take aren’t available in Shanghai. “You’re not getting what you paid for,” she says. A double-major in journalism and psychology, Feng pays $50,000 per semester in fees. Her parents, who work as civil servants in a small city in northeastern China, have had to make huge sacrifices to support her dream of studying abroad, she says. But despite their disappointment with the university’s decision, several students planning to enter the Go Local scheme tell Sixth Tone they’re resigned to paying the full fees, reasoning they’d have to pay the same to attend online classes anyway. “I don’t think it’s worth it, but it’s still the best choice,” says Chen. “I made the decision (to sign up for the Go Local scheme) myself. As long as I don’t return to New York, my parents agree with any choices I make.” The imminent arrival of thousands of Go Local students, meanwhile, is causing disquiet among NYU Shanghai’s own student body, who worry their new classmates will overwhelm the small campus.  “Each year our school has fewer than 2,000 students and faculty, and it already feels cramped,” says Vincent Wu, an interactive media arts major at NYU Shanghai. “How will the school be able to control the number of students entering the building and at the same time provide a manageable environment for people … to socially distance?” NYU Shanghai has tried to reassure its students, stressing that permanently enrolled students will have priority access to resources within the academic building. But Cai Tingting, who’s about to start her final year, says she’s still concerned she’ll find it harder to access the campus’s career guidance services. “If the departments receive more requests, their efficiency will decline,” says Cai. “That will definitely impact us.” Yet despite all the potential disadvantages, go local schemes appear to be popular among China’s international students. Those enrolled at other U.S. universities tell Sixth Tone students have been lobbying their schools to set up similar programs. Yang Hang, an up-and-coming junior at Bates College, wrote to her school’s administrators in early July, asking the school to create a go local option for the around 60 Chinese students enrolled at the college. As a neuroscience major, Yang emphasized her courses mostly include lab experiments that can’t be replicated through remote learning. Bates, however, turned down the student’s request, telling her the college was “not moving toward that direction.” Yang says she’s now unsure what she’ll do next. “I’ll see if I can only take the courses without lab work,” she says. “If that doesn’t work, then I’ll take a gap semester.”  At Mount Holyoke College, several Chinese students approached the school in early July to demand a go local option, according to Zheng Ruining, a 20-year-old anthropology major at the college. Again, however, the school rejected these calls, and Zheng says she now has no other choice but to take online courses in the fall. “I really miss the in-person learning experience,” says Zheng. “I guess I’ll invite my friends to a library so we can study together, to mimic the in-class experience.” Back at NYU Shanghai, sources at the school tell Sixth Tone they’re rushing to prepare the new WeWork classrooms by mid-August. Cai Tingting, the rising senior, says she’s sure everyone will get on board with the Go Local plan in the end. “Many remain concerned because a lot of information is still unclear,” says Cai. “Once we’re back at school, I think things will be just fine.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005984
Xinjiang Reports Largest Single-Day Spike in Coronavirus Cases,"In just two days this week, China has seen its highest spike in new coronavirus infections in months, with several cities including Urumqi and Dalian taking strict measures to control local outbreaks.",2020-07-28,"China’s northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on Monday recorded 57 new COVID-19 cases, the region’s largest-ever daily increase. Xinjiang’s coronavirus tally now stands at 235 total confirmed infections. In addition, 13 residents tested positive for the coronavirus without showing signs of infection, bringing Xinjiang’s count of asymptomatic cases — which are counted separately from “confirmed,” or symptomatic, infections — to 165. The bulk of the infections are in Urumqi, the region’s capital city, which has been shut down since a local outbreak was detected earlier this month. The city now accounts for 233 out of Xinjiang’s 235 total confirmed infections, including all of Monday’s newly added cases. Over the past two days, China has seen its largest spike in confirmed cases in three months, and authorities are on high alert against another wave of infections. On Monday, 68 additional cases were reported on the Chinese mainland, the highest daily figure for local infections since April. Four out of the 68 are imported infections, while the remaining 64 are locally transmitted. Among the local cases, 57 are in Xinjiang, six are in the northeastern port city of Dalian, and another is in Beijing. Last week, Dalian reported a COVID-19 cluster after a man working at a seafood processing factory tested positive for the virus. Health officials are now testing the city’s entire population, according to a notice Sunday. Nine cities including Beijing have reported COVID-19 cases linked to the Dalian cluster, and both Urumqi and Dalian have gone into “wartime mode” in response to spikes in infections. To contain the local outbreak, Xinjiang officials announced Sunday that Urumqi is conducting a second round of mass health screenings in the city’s two high-risk areas, Tianshan and Saybagh districts. Xinjiang’s first local patient was identified as a 24-year-old woman working at a Tianshan District shopping center. Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi’s health commission, said at a press briefing Sunday that the purpose of the additional screenings is to “check for omissions” after the first round. “Just one nucleic test can produce a false negative, so two tests are needed to rule out the possibility (of infection),” Zhang said. Local hospitals have been converted into quarantine facilities to increase their COVID-19 treatment capabilities, officials said Sunday. As of Monday, a total of 8,809 people in the region were under medical observation.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005987
Shanghai Cancels Major Int’l Sporting Events Scheduled for 2020,The city had planned to host more than 180 international and domestic competitions this year.,2020-07-24,"Some significant annual sporting events will be missing from Shanghai’s activities calendar this year. Juss Event Management Co. Ltd., which organizes many of the city’s premier sporting events, said Friday that several international tournaments scheduled for 2020 have been canceled. Major competitions including the Rolex Shanghai Masters tennis tournament, Shanghai Longines Global Champions Tour equestrian event, and the Shanghai Masters snooker tournament have all been called off. “Although the current pandemic situation is under control in China, it’s still not optimistic abroad,” Juss said in a statement, adding that the country’s restrictions on international travelers might also have affected the games. On July 9, the General Administration of Sport issued directives for the “scientific and orderly recovery” of sports events and activities in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. The country’s top sports authority said that, in theory, China would not host any international sporting events this year apart from “important events” associated with the 2022 Winter Olympics, to be held in Beijing.  Li Jiahao, an avid tennis fan, told Sixth Tone that watching matches courtside is a family tradition. The 23-year-old said he is disappointed that the October tournament has been canceled. “I thought the pandemic would be under control by then,” Li said. “If cinemas can be open to the public, how come these events can’t be held?” Wang Xinda, a 40-year-old horse owner, isn’t surprised this year’s equestrian competition has been canceled, however. “After all, safety is more important than the race,” he told Sixth Tone. “International entry is difficult and risky, so cancellation is a matter of course. I might have been more worried had it not been canceled.” Shanghai had planned to host more than 180 international and domestic competitions this year. However, a large number of 2020 competitions have been postponed or canceled — apart from some held in January — as coronavirus infections spread throughout China and the world. In June, the Chinese Basketball Association became the first professional sports league in the country to resume play after being disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak for five months. And on Saturday, China’s top professional soccer league will also restart games after 1,870 soccer players and staff members all tested negative for the virus.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005976
"Coronavirus Cluster Reported in Dalian, Northeast China",The 15 cases — only three of whom are symptomatic — are the city’s first local infections in months.,2020-07-23,"The northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning has reported 15 local COVID-19 infections in the city of Dalian, according to a government press conference Thursday. Prior to these cases, Dalian had not had a local coronavirus infection in over three months. The city initially reported just one case: a 58-year-old man who lives alone and works for a seafood processing company. He had shown symptoms on July 16 and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday. Dalian authorities then identified another two cases from among the man’s close contacts, both of whom showed symptoms. None of the three individuals — who are all in stable condition — had left the city for two weeks before contracting the virus. Government inspectors detected the coronavirus in multiple areas of the seafood processing factory where the first patient works — in frozen food, at on-site dining facilities, and in workers’ dormitories, among other places — though an inspection of the metal factory where one of the other two patients works did not find signs of the virus. Zhao Lian, deputy director of Dalian’s health department, said the local government has suspended operations at the seafood processing factory, as well as 18 local businesses that distribute the company’s products. Officials now plan to test 160,000 people living in the city’s seafood trade zone. Detecting coronavirus at the first patient’s workplace has again raised suspicions about a possible link between the virus and seafood. Previously, Beijing authorities had found the coronavirus on a chopping board used for salmon after an outbreak at the country’s largest produce market in mid-June. The discovery stoked fears among locals, causing a sharp decline in seafood consumption. However, experts have said there is insufficient evidence to establish a seafood link. With the new infections in Dalian, Liaoning has become the third provincial-level region of China to report local cases of COVID-19 since June, following clusters in Beijing and Xinjiang.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005970
China to Require Negative COVID-19 Tests for All Inbound Travelers,"Some wonder whether the policy, aimed at curbing imported infections, is practical for countries where tests are slow and access to them is restricted.",2020-07-22,"Air passengers traveling to China will be required to provide a negative COVID-19 test result from no more than five days before their departure date to “reduce the risk of cross-border transmission,” according to an announcement jointly issued Tuesday by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, General Administration of Customs, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The rule will apply to both Chinese citizens and the few foreign nationals who have been cleared to enter the country on diplomatic, service, “courtesy,” and crew visas. Other foreigners — including tourists and people with still-valid work permits — have not been allowed into China since a travel ban was instituted in late March. “The tests should be conducted at institutions designated or approved by Chinese embassies abroad,” the announcement said. While stopping short of giving examples of such institutions, it said Chinese embassies would consider the testing capabilities of foreign countries and release further details later. The mandatory policy has sparked concerns among some online, who noted that COVID-19 tests may not be readily accessible to healthy travelers, depending on where they’re based. And some Chinese people stranded abroad say it will now be even harder for them to return home, after China in June decided to reduce flight frequency and penalize airlines whose passengers test positive for the coronavirus. “Please consider the enforceability of the policy. In many countries, people without symptoms can’t qualify to be tested, and the test result might not be ready within five days,” one netizen commented on microblogging platform Weibo under a related post. Earlier this month, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms made headlines for having to wait eight days for a positive coronavirus test result. As of Tuesday, China has recorded over 2,000 total imported cases of COVID-19. Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, people arriving from abroad were required to submit to testing upon arrival, as well as 14 days’ quarantine.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005963
Urumqi on High Alert Amid Rising Coronavirus Infections,Officials said the city has gone into “wartime mode” and is launching mass health screenings to track and trace potential cases.,2020-07-20,"Authorities in northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are on high alert after 17 new coronavirus cases were reported Monday, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the region to 47. Of the new cases, 16 were recorded in the capital of Urumqi, which has been shut down since Thursday following a spike in locally transmitted infections. The other case was reported in Kashgar prefecture, though the exact location hasn’t been disclosed. As of Monday, 96 people in Urumqi had tested positive for the virus — including 46 confirmed and 50 asymptomatic cases. In China, confirmed cases refer to people who both test positive for the virus and show symptoms. On Saturday, local officials announced at a press briefing that Urumqi had gone into “wartime mode” and asked people not to leave the city unless necessary. Two of the city’s districts — Tianshan and Saybagh — have also been designated “high-risk areas,” becoming the only two areas categorized as such in the entire country. Rui Baoling, director of the Urumqi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during the Saturday briefing that the fresh wave of infections could be traced to a “gathering activity” in the city’s Tianshan District, without elaborating further. Urumqi has also launched mass health screenings since Friday, first targeting buildings and neighborhoods with infections and later the entire city. The National Health Commission has dispatched medical teams with over 200 health care professionals from other provinces to improve the city’s testing capacity. Apart from the 17 confirmed cases in Xinjiang, China saw five more infections Sunday, all of which were imported. As of Monday morning, the Chinese mainland had 83,682 confirmed COVID-19 cases since the country started publishing data in January.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005951
Urumqi Shuts Down After New Coronavirus Cases Confirmed,The city in Northwest China has restricted people’s movements after new infections were reported for the first time in almost five months.,2020-07-17,"At least two cities in northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are under lockdown as authorities have confirmed more than a dozen coronavirus infections since Thursday. The regional capital Urumqi is said to be prohibiting more than 3 million people from leaving their residential compounds and hotels since Thursday night, Southern Metropolis Daily reported. By Friday afternoon, Urumqi had reported 17 coronavirus infections — six confirmed and 11 asymptomatic — just a day after the city confirmed its first patient. Thursday’s infection was also Xinjiang’s first after being coronavirus-free for nearly five months. Meanwhile, Kashgar and the 11 counties it administers have also been restricting residents’ movements since 8 a.m. Friday, an official at the city’s epidemic prevention and control center told Sixth Tone. The official, who declined to give her name, said the center has been closely monitoring local health risks and has asked people to stay indoors, though the city has yet to report an infection. Urumqi residents told Sixth Tone their neighborhood committees had informed them of the lockdown shortly before it went into effect at the end of Thursday. On microblogging site Weibo, residents said they had to scramble for foodstuffs at grocery stores before the restrictions were enforced. A local guesthouse owner who asked to be identified as Li Qian said she is staying indoors and waiting for the local residential committee to arrange for nucleic acid tests. She added that residents have been asked to stay home for a week. So far, there has been no official release about the outbreak control measures, though local media outlet Tianshan Net has published several epidemic control measure updates on Weibo. Urumqi has suspended an annual degree exam scheduled for Saturday, as well as its subway service, effective Thursday. The resurgence of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has also led to a temporary suspension of a major bus line at Changji, a satellite city 30 kilometers east of Urumqi, according to the state-run People’s Daily. The transportation company’s 931 staff members will be tested for the virus. The Xinjiang government has vowed to take the “strictest” measures to track and trace potential infections, while monitoring people traveling to and from the region for any symptoms, Xinjiang Daily reported, citing a Thursday meeting chaired by Chen Quanguo, the region’s party secretary. On Friday, over 600 scheduled flights were canceled at Urumqi’s Diwopu International Airport, according to Reuters. Several airlines including China Eastern and Juneyao Air now require passengers to present a negative nucleic acid test from the past seven days, as well as a green “health code” for all flights to Urumqi.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005947
Shanghai-Made COVID-19 Vaccine Ready for Human Trials,The candidate is one of a select few mRNA-based vaccines — advantageous because the most laborious steps of the immunization process can take place after inoculation — being tested worldwide.,2020-07-15,"China’s National Medical Products Administration on Tuesday accepted the human trial application for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine co-developed by a Shanghai pharmaceutical company using a promising new technology. The candidate, dubbed BNT162b1, is a messenger RNA vaccine from domestic firm Fosun Pharma and its German partner BioNTech. It’s among the first nucleic acid-based vaccines — a relatively novel biomedical technology pioneered over the last two decades — devised to target the COVID-19 virus. Experts see mRNA-based vaccines as potential game-changers because of their capacity to overcome current manufacturing challenges, such as slow production times, faced by manufacturers of conventional vaccines. For traditional vaccines, scientists have to go through a laborious and costly process of growing, purifying, and replicating a harmless part of the virus in the lab before they can be administered. But for mRNA-based vaccines, these steps can happen within the human body, after inoculation. Although the technology has previously been tested with Ebola vaccines, for example, no candidate has been approved for commercial use anywhere in the world. Before BNT162b1, an mRNA vaccine candidate developed by China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences began early-stage human trials in late June. Meanwhile, the U.S. biotech company Moderna is another step ahead still, having completed its first-stage trials in May.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005937
Artistic Distances: Giving Form to Grief in a Pandemic,COVID-19 can’t reveal or crystallize some deeper meaning about the universe. But it also can’t stop us from making our own.,2020-07-10,"“I miss my friends.” “I’m angry all the time.” “I feel so depressed that I just wear my pajamas and lie in bed all day.” My students were not in a great place this March. Nor was I, for that matter. I’d been in Italy for six weeks by that point: a stretch that somehow felt like both a lifetime and just a minute. I was angry and depressed at my life, at how far I was from my home in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, from my friends and loved ones, from my apartment and things. I wished I knew when all this would end. Above all else, I felt — and still feel — broken by grief. A few days before that class — held via Zoom across a distance of almost 9,000 kilometers — I’d read about an official Chinese project to collect mementos and artifacts from the country’s battle against COVID-19. It inspired me to rethink my students’ final assignments: Rather than write another term paper, I had them curate a digital exhibition dedicated to the pandemic, a kind of collective personal diary of those difficult months. After some brainstorming, we came up with a theme: “六/6: Finding Meaning” — a reference to the stages of grief we were all experiencing.  As famously theorized by Elizabeth Kübler-Ross in “On Grief and Grieving,” the five stages of grief are, in order: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Normally, they are associated with loss, as in death. Yet, as longtime Kübler-Ross collaborator David Kessler emphasizes, life gives us many reasons to grieve, from a loss of normalcy or economic difficulties to simple isolation. Kübler-Ross’s theory of grief became our exhibition’s organizing principle. One of the virtual rooms, “DABDA” (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance), consists of objects that, in the experiences of my students, connect with one of those stages, helping us express our suffering. But there is also another stage, added later by Kessler, that was crucial to our plans: meaning. Dissatisfied with the idea that acceptance is the end of the healing process, Kessler was convinced that to become whole again we must first find meaning in the darkness that envelops us. At a time like this, that could be as simple as realizing not all is lost — that we can wear masks and protect ourselves, that we can still tell those we care about that we love them, and that we can still make art with others even when they’re a world away. That’s why we called our project “六/6: Finding Meaning.” The number six of course refers to that final stage of grief, but the repetition of the Chinese and Arabic numerals also echoes the Chinese expression liuliu dashun — “May everything go smoothly.” By working together creatively, we realized that life was not over: We could do something here and now that was significance to us, something good and fulfilling. And we could find new ways of being together. Nanjing University, where I work, was extremely supportive and gave us a generous grant that allowed us to develop and produce our digital exhibition in collaboration with Difforme design studio in Beijing. Thanks to word-of-mouth and a bit of luck, 18 artists — both foreign and Chinese — also agreed to participate, donating both time and artwork. Some of these artists have been exhibited in the most famous venues of the art world, including the Venice Biennale, yet they all saw something in our small project. We collected their donations in a virtual room called “六/6,” a space where we can metaphorically and metonymically conquer our pain and find meaning in our suffering through the medium of artistic transformation. The third and final room — though the first you see when you enter the virtual exhibition — is “Emotional Timeline.” Here, a group of students, in collaboration with Italian duo Biancoshock & Rolenzo, artistically re-interpreted the timeline of the pandemic in an effort to capture the distorted sense of temporal unfolding that I have mentioned above. It consists of a reproduction of this year’s fluctuations in the Shanghai stock market, manipulated to reflect students’ emotional states during that time. Before the pandemic, economic forces could seem irresistible — undulating laws of nature. But COVID-19 showed how something as small as a virus can upend them.  There is certainly some irony in the fact that the most important cultural production I’ve participated in has come at a time when the art world has largely shut down. Indeed, it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that it came about because the art world shut down, or at least, because of what shut it down. Some might read this as some kind of artistic theodicy vindicating the evils of COVID-19 in light of the good it has brought about. But that’s not what I mean: Pain, suffering, and tragedy are meaningless on their own. They do not on their own make us better people or reveal some ultimate significance. Indeed, the point of our exhibition isn’t that COVID-19 brought us here. It’s that, in spite of COVID-19, in spite of all the darkness of the past six months, the human gaze can still illuminate our world. When surrounded by senseless pain, human creativity can still perform miracles, even ones as simple as finding meaning in a time of loss. The author would like to thank his students, teaching assistant, and everyone who participated in “六/6: Finding Meaning.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005918
WHO Researchers to Investigate Animal Origin of COVID-19 in China,A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry has voiced support for the recently announced mission.,2020-07-08,"The World Health Organization has announced it will send a team of experts to China in the coming weeks to investigate potential animal hosts of the COVID-19 virus. “Identifying the origin of emerging viral disease has proven complex in past epidemics in different countries,” the WHO said in a statement released Tuesday evening local time. “A well planned series of scientific researches will advance the understanding of animal reservoirs and the route of transmission to humans.” Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, voiced support for the upcoming trip as well as other “scientific research by international scientists on the virus’ origin and transmission routes” during his regular press conference Tuesday. Scientists with the WHO say they’ve been in touch with China about the trip since early May. “There is discussion with our counterparts in China for a further mission, which would be more academic in focus and really focus on looking at what happened at the beginning in terms of the exposures with different animals, so that we can look to have an approach to find the zoonotic source,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit. Previously, China had called a proposed probe into the origin of the new disease a “politically motivated” move. Authorities from Australia and the European Union had proposed such an investigation prior to an annual meeting of the WHO’s member states in May. At that meeting, China and the other 193 WHO members attending voted in favor of an independent review into the global COVID-19 response, which did not appear to target China specifically.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005907
How China’s Restaurants Are Adapting to a Post-Coronavirus World,"COVID-19 has turned up the heat on fine dining establishments everywhere, including in China. But Chinese restaurateurs aren’t ready to sell burgers just yet.",2020-07-03,"“Noma is serving burgers.” The news seemed to be on everybody’s lips last month: Against the backdrop of an industry battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, chef René Redzepi announced he was converting his famous Copenhagen Michelin two-star restaurant into a hamburger joint. The coronavirus has dealt a heavy blow to restaurateurs around the world. In the United States, which has bailed out major restaurant brands as many independent eateries face annihilation, chef Gabrielle Hamilton of Prune’s moving account of laying off her entire staff called attention to an industry in crisis. In Europe, restaurant owners are split between a desire to return to business as usual and those trying to reinvent themselves. Redzepi was willing to abandon his previous business model as a destination restaurant for traveling foodies and instead cater to locals with simpler fare. Anna Roš, chef of Slovenia’s Hiša Franko, has lobbied the Slovenian government to reopen its border to save her business and the livelihoods of her team members. Everywhere restaurateurs are asking the same question: What does a post-coronavirus restaurant look like? If China, where eateries have been allowed to open since late March, is anything to go by, the result of the current crisis will be less a reinvention and more an acceleration of preexisting trends. China’s economic growth was showing signs of slowing even before the current crisis, a shift that prompted a number of restaurant operators to launch more affordable spinoffs of their high-end brands in recent years. Xin Rong Ji operates multiple highly regarded restaurants in China, including the country’s only Michelin three-star restaurant dedicated to Chinese cuisine. In 2018, however, the brand opened a new bistro, Xiao Rong Guan, with more affordable, pared down versions of their famous dishes. Later that year, the bistro was followed by an even earthier restaurant aimed at middle class and business diners and centered on a kind of yellow croaker noodle soup from the eastern Zhejiang province. Famous Shanghai restaurant Yong Fu, which serves high-end dishes from the nearby coastal city of Ningbo, opened a less expensive bistro option of its own in 2019. This trend is likely to intensify during 2020, as restaurants seek to cater to customers who are more fiscally cautious and more discerning than before. Up and down the value chain, already notable trends — like the decline of the business dinner, as well as falling consumption figures — have intensified, pushing restaurants to make their meals more affordable. Post-coronavirus, hot pot and barbecue places are packed with customers in their 20s and 30s, and many mid-range and fine dining restaurants have started offering affordable lunch menus or are cutting prices to attract value-conscious patrons. Others are looking for ways to take the fine dining experience outside the restaurant’s walls and into customers’ homes, including through differentiated delivery options. Qu Lang Yuan in Beijing launched a special delivery menu that comes in a tin box, aimed at nostalgic younger diners. Fu Yisheng, owner of the restaurant group Yanyu, has started exploring delivery options that would allow customers to cook restaurant meals in their own kitchens: “After the COVID-19 crisis, customers increasingly want quality for an affordable price,” he told me. “We are searching for ways to provide some of our restaurants’ meals for consumers to cook at home, while instructing them on how to do it so it turns out just as good as it is in the restaurant.” Meanwhile, in a market shaken by repeated food scandals, the general public has for years been demanding higher-quality produce and improved food safety. This trend, too, has been accelerated by the spread of COVID-19, which has cast a shadow on wet markets and led to a renewed ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals. But again, signs of a shift in consumer habits and restaurateur attitudes toward wildlife conservation were already visible before the current crisis. At Yu Waitan in Shanghai, Fujian-born chef Wu Rong has been serving a version of “Buddha jumps over the wall” soup without the traditional shark fin for over a year now — an attempt to respect tradition while adapting to new standards. Now a number of restaurateurs are going farther as they reflect on humanity’s relationship with wildlife, post-coronavirus. As China tries to relaunch its economy, the dining scene in major cities doesn’t appear to be revolutionizing itself. Rather, it is adapting to the demands of diners for more value, more variety, and more safety.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005867
"Post-Coronavirus, China Should Listen to Its Deaf Community",Deaf and hard-of-hearing Chinese are fighting to ensure the country doesn’t repeat the communication miscues of January and February.,2020-06-29,"As cities across China battled the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns and quarantines put the country’s more than 20 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in a vulnerable position. Although the entire DHH community faced challenges in accessing important information, socializing, or communicating with delivery and medical workers, the barriers were especially high for middle-aged and elderly DHH Chinese, who generally have lower levels of literacy and are more reliant on sign language to communicate. Indeed, flashy technological advances like hearing aids and cochlear implants lead many to underestimate the communication difficulties members of the DHH community, myself included, continue to face. In addition to the inherent limitations of these technologies, poor literacy prevents many DHH individuals from following television subtitles, participating in epidemiological surveys, and accessing community services. These dilemmas are even more acute for families in which several members are hard of hearing. In addition, full-time sign language interpreters remain relatively scarce in China, especially in medical, legal, and educational settings. After one illiterate, hard-of-hearing 75-year-old COVID-19 patient was admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital in the central city of Wuhan, medical staff there were forced to search their social media contacts to find someone who could speak sign language. In nearby Leishenshan Hospital, five of one ward’s 34 COVID-19 inpatients were hard of hearing. The nurses there had to learn sign language on the fly, with access only to badly outdated instructional videos. Their opaque protective clothing, masks, and goggles made it even harder for their patients to effectively and accurately obtain information through signals, facial expressions, and lip-reading. These and other difficulties have led to renewed calls from the DHH community for “barrier-free” information access. In numerous chat groups, I watched as deaf and hard-of-hearing people of different ages, genders, educational backgrounds, and occupations joined together to vent their frustrations about their feelings of isolation and desire for accessible services such as sign language interpreting and subtitles. One sore spot was how difficult it was to access authoritative updates about the outbreak. As early as 2012, China mandated all governments above the county level to provide “barrier-free information exchange services,” including both sign language interpretation and subtitles, when making important government announcements. However, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, televised press conferences only rarely included sign language interpretation. It took time, but the situation gradually improved as the pandemic wore on. On Feb. 4, local officials in Beijing took the lead by adding sign language interpreters to press briefings on COVID-19 prevention and control. Learning from international practices, interpreters wore homemade masks with a transparent central section to allow DHH individuals to read their facial expressions and lips. The cities of Tianjin and Shanghai followed suit, with the latter allocating one-third of the screen to the sign language interpreter — instead of the usual small box — and subtitling all live broadcasts. On Feb. 10, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, offered simultaneous sign language interpretation on a live broadcast for the first time. Social organizations also helped link members with official updates and medical information. The China Association of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing produced social app WeChat videos reminding DHH not to go out unless absolutely necessary. Local associations also compiled verified media reports and invited users proficient in sign language to shoot short recaps and post them on social media. And in the southwestern city of Chongqing, officials asked trained psychologists for their advice on DHH individuals trapped inside due to the outbreak, turning their tips into animated shorts and publishing them on social media. Due to high demand, grassroots media content created by and for DHH individuals also played an important role during the outbreak. Statistics show that at the peak of China’s epidemic, WeChat articles, Weibo microblogs, and short videos on Douyin and Kuaishou targeting the DHH community were produced mostly by individuals or loose nongovernmental volunteer organizations. These covered everything from news and current affairs to health tips, information on disability rights, and psychological counseling. Although the pandemic has improved information accessibility in China, these advances still fall short of fully meeting the needs of DHH Chinese. Take the distribution of epidemic prevention materials, for example. During a crisis, access to accurate information is absolutely crucial. Yet much of what circulated on social media earlier this year was either redundant or factually questionable. Even organizations trying to produce accessible options sometimes failed to offer both sign language and subtitles, perhaps because they were unaware of the different needs of DHH individuals. According to a 2016 World Health Organization guideline, infectious disease response plans should address the needs of individuals and groups considered particularly vulnerable and ensure they have access to key services and resources. Life as a member of the DHH community can be isolating, even at the best of times. In a pandemic, it is all the more important to ensure the community is not left adrift in a sea of misinformation. As it reviews the lessons of the past six months, China should keep the importance of accessibility in mind.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005865
China’s COVID-19 Vaccine Makers Are Going Abroad for Human Trials,"With dwindling coronavirus cases at home, Chinese biomedical companies are cooperating with Brazil and the UAE for phase three clinical trials.",2020-06-24,"China is leading the global race to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with three candidates now ready for large-scale human trials. But domestic pharmaceutical companies have found themselves in an unexpected predicament: There aren’t enough local infections. As a result, companies like China National Biotec Group are going abroad. On Thursday, the domestic vaccine maker signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to conduct phase three clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Middle Eastern country. Phase three trials are when drugmakers typically determine whether a vaccine is effective. After injecting a large number of volunteers with the experimental vaccine, researchers observe whether their infection rates are lower compared with a control group of people who don’t receive the vaccine. Phase three trials are generally the last hurdle before a vaccine maker applies for a commercial production license. “We don’t really have an outbreak here to do a phase three trial,” Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone. “We need to do trials in areas where the risk of transmission is relatively high.”  As of Wednesday, the UAE has reported more than 45,000 total cases of COVID-19, and has been adding around 300 a day this week. The CNBG-UAE alliance is the second of its kind. Another Chinese vaccine maker, Sinovac, announced a partnership with the Instituto Butantan, a Brazilian biomedical research center in São Paulo, on June 11. Sinovac plans to conduct clinical trials of its vaccine, CoronaVac, on some 9,000 volunteers in Brazil. The South American country has emerged as a COVID-19 hot spot, with a total case count of more than 1 million and a death toll of over 50,000 as of this week. Dimas Covas, director of the Instituto Butantan, said that the clinical trial collaboration with Sinovac “will bring hope to have a vaccine in the short term,” and added that the institute will also support the “commercialization and manufacturing” of CoronaVac in Brazil. During phase two clinical trials, the candidate vaccines for both Sinovac and CNBG appeared to be safe and induce antibody production in recipients. Antibodies are molecules that fend off viruses, but simply having them doesn’t guarantee immunity, Shen said. “There can be many reasons for this,” the epidemiologist said. “For example, the antibodies might be too weak or too few in number to stop an infection.” Shen added that some experimental HIV vaccines have failed to protect against the virus even though participants produced antibodies.   Sinovac declined Sixth Tone’s interview request, and CNBG did not return phone calls by time of publication. On Sunday, China’s National Health Commission said that five domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates had entered human trials, with three having already completed phase two. “Going abroad for a clinical trial is probably the best choice we have,” Huang Yanzhong, a global health expert at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, told Sixth Tone. “Otherwise, you would have to inoculate people with a test vaccine that may or may not work, then expose them to the virus. That’s too risky.”  Huang said such bilateral agreements can be win-win scenarios. “This will help China accelerate its vaccine development, and for Brazil, they can have the vaccine sooner,” he said. Conducting clinical trials abroad isn’t a new idea, especially in the field of infectious diseases, Shen said. The vaccines for Ebola and HIV were both engineered in countries like the U.S. and China, then taken to high-risk areas for trials. How long the phase three trials will take remains uncertain, Huang said. “It will depend on a lot of factors, such as government support and whether enough people in the other country are willing to participate. You need a large sample size for this kind of trial.” “I know many people are now counting on an effective vaccine, but it’s not enough to stop this disease,” Shen said, adding that a vaccine may not be effective for some people. “Only if we maintain healthy lifestyles — such as continuing to wear face masks and practicing handwashing — can we really stop the spread of, and even eradicate, the disease.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005855
Chinese Basketball League Resumes Season After 5-Month Hiatus,The remaining 70-plus games of the CBA season will be played over the next two weeks in Qingdao and Dongguan.,2020-06-22,"The Chinese Basketball Association on Saturday became the first professional sports league in the country to resume play after being disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year.  The league’s 20 teams will play their remaining 78 games without spectators in the coastal cities of Qingdao and Dongguan over a frenetic two-week period. The top 12 teams will qualify for the playoffs, which begin with single, winner-moves-on games. The semifinals and finals will each be decided by best-of-three series. A commencement ceremony held Friday in Qingdao featured a one-armed 13-year-old basketball player who recently became an online sensation by torching the competition in a one-on-one tournament. The following morning, after observing a minute of silence in remembrance of the victims of COVID-19, the league officially resumed, with the Zhejiang Lions facing off against the Nanjing Tongxi Monkey King. To make up for the lack of a live audience, seats in the arenas were filled with stuffed animals — pandas, dinosaurs, tigers, and unicorns, among others — or outfitted with basketball, soccer, and esports jerseys. During Saturday’s five games, large screens placed courtside displayed Zoom-like mosaics of faces spectating and reacting in real time. The same screens also broadcast cheerleaders’ performances between quarters.  But it wasn’t just the roaring crowds that were missing. Numerous teams had to suit up without crucial foreign players — who tend to dominate the league’s major statistical categories — because they’re stuck outside China and can’t return under current entry restrictions targeting foreign passport holders. The impact of these absences was widely discussed ahead of the league’s restart, with many wondering whether the now-uneven distribution of foreigners is fair, whether it will affect the quality of play, and whether the situation could give Chinese players a chance to shine as they fill the large shoes of their foreign teammates. “Challenge goes along with opportunity for us,” said Wang Fei, the head coach of the Shanxi Loongs, in a June interview. “Without foreign players, I hope that domestic players can shoulder more responsibility.” The CBA suspended its season in late January to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Initially, play was slated to resume on April 15, but that date was delayed after the league failed to secure approval from the General Administration of Sport, the country’s top sports authority. Only on June 4 did the CBA finally announce that the season would resume on June 20.  In a recent interview with state broadcaster China Central Television, the CBA’s chairman, Yao Ming, said he consulted Zhong Nanshan — the highly regarded epidemiologist tasked with coordinating China’s coronavirus response, whose wife Li Shaofen played on China’s national basketball team in the 1950s and ’60s — to formulate a strict, detailed plan for resuming play safely. As part of that plan, players must bring their health records to all games and complete three nucleic acid tests prior to playing — at two weeks, three to five days, and at the venue before their first game. After arriving at designated hotel complexes in Qingdao and Dongguan, players must submit to temperature checks twice daily, and they must live, eat, and sleep on the premises. If players apply for and receive permission to leave the hotel grounds, they must do so in specially assigned vehicles. The sports arenas are divided into green, blue, and yellow zones separating players and team personnel, media, and venue staff. They’ve also been equipped with temperature scanners and one-way ventilation systems. Apart from players and referees, everyone in the arena must wear a mask at all times. As the CBA restarts, the country’s other sports leagues remain in limbo, waiting for a green light, if they haven’t been canceled outright. The Super League, China’s top professional soccer league, has repeatedly proposed restart scenarios to the General Administration of Sport, but all of them have run aground. The Super League, too, is dealing with the problem of its foreign stars being stranded abroad — though some have managed to return to China even amid the entry ban.  Meanwhile, China’s women’s basketball league — whose players frequently overshadow their male counterparts at international competitions — will not resume this year, and the CBA’s North American equivalent, the NBA, is planning to resume a special 22-team playoff in late July at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida under a similar bubble-like scenario to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The motto for the resumed CBA season — quanli yi fu, or “recovering with all our might” — reflects how the league sees itself as a trailblazer paving the way for other sports to follow in this especially challenging year. Before resuming games, the CBA released a promotional video depicting heart-wrenching scenes from Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first detected, paired with basketball scenes as a metaphor for the country coming back to life. “As the first large-scale domestic sports competition to restart, resuming the CBA is of far-reaching strategic significance,” Yao wrote in an open letter to CBA staff. “Its social impact goes beyond basketball itself.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005838
PepsiCo China Shuts Beijing Plant After Finding COVID-19 Cases,"Eight workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, a government official said.",2020-06-22,"PepsiCo China has suspended operations at a food-processing plant in Beijing and quarantined 480 people after one of its employees tested positive for the coronavirus, a company executive said at a press briefing Sunday. Fan Zhimin, PepsiCo China’s director of corporate affairs, said the company had tested the entire plant’s staff as well as their close contacts, without specifying the number of infections. The company immediately suspended operations at the Daxing District plant — which produces potato chips and other food items — after an employee was confirmed to have the coronavirus on June 15. A senior disease control official in Beijing said at the same press conference that eight people had tested positive at the Daxing plant. Of them, two were linked to the Xinfadi farmers market, where the capital’s outbreak is believed to have originated. PepsiCo-owned potato chip company Lay’s said on microblogging platform Weibo that the infection was limited to “a small number” of products from one of the company’s seven food-processing plants in China, and assured the public that the coronavirus’ survival rate during food processing and transport is “very low.” The PepsiCo infections come as Beijing is aggressively tracing and testing people with links to the Xinfadi market. As of Monday, the city had reported 236 people confirmed to have COVID-19 since the first infection was detected on June 11. The outbreak has also spread to at least five other provinces — Hebei, Sichuan, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and Henan — according to authorities. Last week, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the outbreak in the capital had been “contained.” Including the eight cases detected at the PepsiCo plant, Beijing reported only nine infections Monday. On Sunday, China’s General Administration of Customs banned imports of poultry products from American meat company Tyson Foods after employees at one of its U.S. plants were found to have the coronavirus. Last week, China also prohibited pork imports from German company Tönnies Group for the same reason.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005839
Mass Virus Testing Strains Beijing’s Resources,The Chinese capital is testing hundreds of thousands of residents amid its recent coronavirus outbreak.,2020-06-19,"The latest coronavirus cluster in Beijing has strained the city’s testing capacity, as authorities try to aggressively track and trace potential virus carriers, financial media outlet Caixin reported Thursday.  Beijing’s city government said it is conducting mass COVID-19 tests in mid- and high-risk neighborhoods, even using big data to trace 355,000 individuals with travel histories to the Xinfadi farmers market. Authorities were on high alert after 46 people connected to the market tested positive for the virus Saturday, prompting them to expand the scale of testing citywide. Estimates from Beijing authorities published Wednesday suggest the city will collect throat and nasal swabs from 400,000 people daily, though authorized facilities can only process 90,000 tests a day. The gap between sampling and testing capacity is resulting in dayslong delays for results, with one company admitting that their 24-hour testing process now takes up to three days. Currently, Beijing has authorized 98 institutes, including public hospitals and private companies, to conduct COVID-19 tests. However, testing at many facilities has far exceeded their capacity, and appointments at several hospitals have been pushed back by at least a month, Southern Weekly reported. Posts on social media show medics and testers working long hours amid the summer heat to keep up with the mass testing drive. Genome-sequencing giant BGI Group told Southern Weekly that it transported more testing equipment — including genome-sequencing devices and biosafety containers — from the central Chinese city of Wuhan to Beijing on Tuesday to keep up with the demand. Now, BGI is able to process 10,000 samples per day compared with roughly 1,000 before. To contain the outbreak, Beijing announced Tuesday that all citizens must present a negative nucleic acid test in order to leave the city. But with COVID-19 tests prioritized for those being compelled to take them, as well as people working at farmers markets and restaurants, other individuals are having a hard time getting screened. Chen Yongpeng, who is in Beijing for business, said booking a COVID-19 test has been an ordeal. “It’s either impossible to get through or the phones are off,” he told Sixth Tone, referring to the contact number for Beijing’s 98 authorized testing locations. Chen said he tried to schedule an appointment more than 10 times but eventually turned to a third-party agency that sent his sample to a testing institute for 260 yuan ($37). The service assigned him a sampling site in Chaoyang District, more than 30 kilometers from where he’s staying in Daxing. “There is no other way,” said Chen, who is scheduled to fly out of the capital on Tuesday. An official who administers residential committees in Beijing’s Fengtai District told domestic media that personal appointments for nucleic acid testing are currently “overcrowded everywhere.” “People who have visited Xinfadi and those working in the service industry, like in restaurants and supermarkets, (need) to get tested first,” the official was quoted as saying. “Individual appointments have to wait.” Sixth Tone’s phone calls to multiple testing institutes didn’t go through on Friday. A Beijing government spokesperson said Thursday that the city is “improving testing capacity.” As of Friday, Beijing had reported 183 confirmed coronavirus cases since the latest outbreak was first detected on June 11, and the city is currently under strict restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the cluster has been contained, and that “new infections will be sporadic.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005827
"Beijing’s COVID Cluster ‘Contained,’ But Search for Source Continues","A leading CDC expert believes the local outbreak’s peak was nearly a week ago, though many of the infected didn’t show symptoms initially.",2020-06-19,"Beijing’s latest coronavirus outbreak has been “contained,” according to the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “The newly reported cases don’t necessarily mean (these patients) are newly infected,” Wu Zunyou said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. He added that all 21 local cases reported Thursday had become infected a week ago but only developed symptoms recently. “The infection peak may have occurred on June 13,” Wu said. “New infections will be sporadic.” On Friday, Beijing reported 25 more COVID-19 cases. Since June 11, the city has identified a total of 183 infections. Prior to this period, Beijing had not reported a single local infection in 56 days. China’s CDC has uploaded the genetic sequences of three virus samples obtained from the recent outbreak to Nextstrain, a public database of genetic information for various pathogens. Experts within China and abroad have noted that the virus responsible for the Beijing outbreak has a similar genome to the coronavirus found in many European countries including Sweden, Denmark, and Portugal. “The current evidence suggests that the virus comes from Europe,” Gao Feng, an infectious disease expert affiliated with Jilin University in Northeast China and Duke University in the U.S., told Sixth Tone. “But we don’t know if these three samples represent the major types that are circulating in Beijing, so we can’t draw any definitive conclusions yet.”  It remains unclear when or how the virus was introduced to Xinfadi, the sprawling farmers market to which the vast majority of the Beijing infections were linked, because of a lack of data. “What we know almost for sure is that the virus was spreading long before it was first identified in Beijing,” Gao said. He added that environmental samples taken from outside the Xinfadi market had tested positive for the virus, too. “Finding the first person to become infected from this local cluster would be the key to figuring out where the virus came from — but this is very difficult,” Gao said. Although all Beijing schools have been suspended amid the recent outbreak, the gaokao — China’s college entrance exam — and zhongkao — the high school entrance exam — will likely go ahead as planned, Beijing’s education bureau said Wednesday. During a press conference Friday, the Ministry of Education announced that face masks will be mandatory for students sitting the gaokao and zhongkao in areas at medium or high risk of COVID-19. As of Friday, the only such areas nationwide are in Beijing.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005832

During a press conference Tuesday night, a Beijing official announced that the city’s emergency response had been upgraded to Level 2 amid a COVID-19 rebound linked to an expansive farmers market that supplies much of the city’s produce. The government had only lowered its emergency response from Level 2 — the second-highest level — less than two weeks before. On Wednesday morning, Beijing reported 31 additional COVID-19 cases from the previous day, bringing the total for the city’s recent outbreak to 137. According to local health authorities, cases have been reported in over half of the capital’s 16 districts. “Beijing is in a grim situation as it tries to prevent the spread of the disease in the city and the country,” said Chen Bei, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing government. “A preliminary investigation suggests this disease cluster resulted from human-to-human transmission and contaminated environmental objects.” Over two-thirds of all flights scheduled to depart Wednesday from Beijing’s two major airports have been canceled, according to domestic media. “Do not leave Beijing unless necessary,” Chen said, adding that anyone who must leave the capital should present a negative coronavirus test result.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005821
"Beijing Reports 27 New COVID-19 Cases, Bringing Total to 106",About three-quarters of the newly reported infections are from the market district where the first cases were detected.,2020-06-16,"Beijing health authorities on Tuesday reported 27 additional COVID-19 cases, taking the city’s tally from the past few days to 106. A fresh wave of coronavirus infections in the Chinese capital was first reported on June 11. Prior to this date, Beijing had not reported a new case in 56 days. Most of the new infections have been linked to the city’s largest farmers market, Xinfadi, which has been closed since early Saturday morning. About three-quarters of Beijing’s newly reported infections are from Fengtai District, where the market is located. Hebei province, which borders Beijing, reported four COVID-19 cases on Monday, all of which have been linked to the cluster in the capital. On Tuesday, officials in Shanghai announced that people traveling “from or through high-risk areas” would be subject to 14 days’ quarantine. Huaxiang, an area of Beijing’s Fengtai District, is currently the only high-risk place in China. Another farmers market in Beijing is also on alert after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Yuquandong market, about 20 minutes’ drive from Xinfadi, as well as 10 residential communities in the area, were sealed off Monday. On Monday, Beijing’s education bureau said that all students who had returned to school could choose instead to study at home, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. Last week, the bureau suspended plans to resume classes for first through third grades, which had been scheduled to start Monday. The main campus of Beijing’s Capital University of Economics and Business, some 15 minutes’ drive from Xinfadi, was put under partial lockdown on Monday. The university has said that all students currently on campus will be tested for the coronavirus. Amid the recent outbreak, China’s vice premier, Sun Chunlan, on Monday ordered officials to aggressively contain the virus, calling for the “strictest” virus-tracking measures to be implemented in areas near Xinfadi market.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005813
China’s Vice Premier Demands ‘Strictest’ Virus-Tracing Measures,A coronavirus infection cluster recently detected in Beijing has officials and citizens on edge.,2020-06-15,"China’s Vice Premier Sun Chunlan has warned of the high risk of a COVID-19 rebound and tasked officials with aggressively tracking the virus after an infection cluster in Beijing was linked to a local farmers market, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday. On Saturday, Beijing’s Fengtai District went into “wartime” mode after 46 people connected to the Xinfandi market — the largest farmers market in the capital — tested positive for the coronavirus. The following day, the city tested 76,499 people, 59 of whom were positive, a health official said at a press briefing Monday morning. However, it’s unclear how many of these positive people are “confirmed infections” — the Chinese authorities’ term for people who both test positive for the virus and show symptoms. Since June 11, Beijing has reported 79 confirmed COVID-19 cases that were locally transmitted, according to the National Health Commission. Two local officials including the deputy chief of Fengtai District, where the market is located, have been fired due to the new infections, the city government said at Monday’s press briefing. Sun has ordered officials to take the “strictest” measures to track and trace the infection in areas near Xinfadi market, which was sealed off Saturday.  As concerns of a possible COVID-19 rebound in China grow, Beijing has ramped up testing of people with travel histories to Xinfadi, or who might have been in contact with anyone who visited the market over the past two weeks. Authorities have confirmed that infections from the Beijing cluster have already spread to other provinces, including three cases in neighboring Hebei province and two cases in Liaoning, in northeastern China. On Saturday, the city of Baoding in Hebei, about two hours’ drive from Beijing, also went into “wartime” mode to guard against an outbreak. Meanwhile, Huaxiang in Fengtian District has been declared the country’s only “high-risk” area for the coronavirus. All residents in the area will be required to observe home isolation or medical observation, while economic activities will be suspended until the outbreak is brought under control. Multiple cities including Wuhan, the center of the initial outbreak in China, have conducted nucleic acid tests on environmental samples — including food, wastewater, and equipment used by vendors — taken from their own food markets following the outbreak in Beijing. According to early investigations at the Xinfadi market, the coronavirus was detected on 40 environmental samples including a chopping board used for salmon. Yang Peng, a researcher at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster China Central Television on Sunday that the source of the virus has not yet been established, though it could have come from contaminated meat or seafood products at the market, or via already-infected people. “Whole-genome sequencing found that the virus came from the direction of Europe, so our preliminary conclusion is that it’s an imported infection,” he said. However, after the broadcast, an unnamed official at Beijing’s health commission appeared to walk back Yang’s remarks, telling financial outlet Caixin on Monday that they were the “scientific assumptions of (just one) CDC expert.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005807
"To Beat the 2020 Blues, Just Push Play","From classical to contemporary, traditional to pop, one team is using music therapy to address stress, fear, and anxiety in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.",2020-06-15,"In a prelude to lilting piano music, a soothing voice whispers: “During this extraordinary time, everyone’s feeling complex emotions like stress, anxiety, or a lack of a sense of security. Don’t worry: All these emotions are fine.” This is part of a 15-minute audio clip uploaded to China’s social app WeChat by a team of teachers and students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (SCM) and released on March 8 to mark International Women's Day. Titled “Listening to the Sound of Blossoms,” the clip serves as a sample of music therapy — something the team intended to use to help people cope with stress and fear in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.  “Music can help regulate physiology and emotions, which can make people feel relaxed. Music has this special function. This audio clip can relieve anxiety and strengthen proper mental defense mechanisms,” Zou Xinghui, a recent graduate from SCM, told Sixth Tone. “In the process, besides being relaxing, it can also mobilize one’s inner vitality.” Within days of offering such online counseling sessions, demand for music therapy surged, according to Zhou Ping, an experienced music therapist and a lecturer at SCM. She heads a team of around 10 music therapists made up of sophomores and recent graduates of the school. Each session, she said, usually lasts 30 minutes with content tailored to meet the needs of different clients. “The pandemic is unlikely to disappear in the near future, and experts have suggested that we might have to fight the virus indefinitely,” Zhou said. “We feel that our profession has a certain sense of mission. When needed, we will rush to the front. There may be trauma after the pandemic, so if people have such needs, we will try to meet the demand.” The same team has been involved in other projects, including background music used in Shanghai’s hospitals. The group has also crafted audio material for hospitals in the central province of Hubei and designed the music for patient and medical worker facilities at the makeshift fangcang hospitals in Hubei’s capital Wuhan.  Since the coronavirus outbreak intensified in late January, several medical workers, patients, and members of the general public have faced unprecedented challenges in terms of mental health — primarily stress, fear, and anxiety. In Hubei province, where China’s epidemic began, counselors on the ground suffering from psychological trauma required support. As COVID-19 spread, and lockdowns were enforced to contain it, psychological pressure in hard-hit areas mounted as people were forced to tackle isolation, disease, death, and abrupt changes to their lives. While the United Nations even warned of a potential global mental health crisis, nearly 25% of the over 25,000 Chinese surveyed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences said they’d experienced depression and anxiety related to the pandemic. Like psychological counselors, Zhou and her team offer support but use music and its many forms to help patients. Domestic media have also reported the work of music therapists, calling them “special doctors who don’t use a lancet.” For their sessions, the SCM team sent out questionnaires specifically designed for those who approached them. This was then used to craft audio material.  While some might have needed “passive” counseling through a piece of music with prerecorded audio guidance, others were happy to take an online session through video calls, said Chen Yunzhi, who graduated about five years ago and works with children. The music they’d choose would depend on the questionnaires and a quick chat between patients and therapists: Some said they felt anxious, while others with chronic diseases said they feared their treatment would be delayed. After this evaluation, therapists would design the session using music that ranged from classical and contemporary to traditional and pop, each identified as effective for different emotions based on their own music library. Among those seeking their services were medical workers who needed music therapy to relax after hours of stressful work and even middle school students in the southwestern city of Chongqing, whose parents worked as doctors or civil servants.  Zou Xinghui, who graduated in 2018, designed the counseling session for the students. It was more about interaction, she said. “We find a song, and then take out a certain word or a sentence,” she told Sixth Tone. “Then we set a theme. For example, say we pay attention to what our current emotions are like, then we fill the lyrics with our emotions and sing the song aloud.” Zou said she and another music therapist would come up with a melody with lyrics starting with “Let’s sing, let’s sing our emotions. Happy, happy, sad, sad. We all understand you.” The therapists would first sing the song and the students from Chongqing would then sing it themselves with their own emotions woven into the lyrics. For other sessions, therapists would write scripts to go along with the music they’d select for clients and observe their reactions. However, music therapy sessions are not designed in a fixed manner, said Zhou. “That’s why our students need to go through three or four years of study and then more training before they understand interacting with clients, discussing problems, and solving them,” she said. “In this process, the form is not that important.” Music therapy can be applied widely to those who are open to such counseling methods, said Yang Yanyi, professor of music therapy at SCM. However, she said the effectiveness varies, and those usually into music might not necessarily find music therapy easier to accept than others. Music therapy came to China only in the 1990s, when the prestigious Central Conservatory of Music started to admit postgraduate students for the major. Now, with Chinese people turning to counseling more often than previous generations, music therapy has started to gain momentum with the general public. The interdisciplinary major requires practitioners to understand music, medicine, and psychology. Students are expected to be able to play different instruments, sing songs, and improvise when required. “They have to be versatile,” said Yang. “They learn more instruments and take more singing lessons. In addition, they also learn how to experience the emotions of others.”  The music therapy major at SCM takes in about five students a year. In China, few universities offer such degrees, and the profession is also not fully recognized across the country. In all, there were only around 200 music therapists on record as of 2017. But music therapy in the wake of the outbreak hasn’t been easy for the Shanghai team, and some highlighted the new challenges they’ve had to face. In particular, poor internet connections, preparing questionnaires for unprecedented situations, and transitioning from their usual clients — children — to adults. To cope with such practical issues and help the younger therapists, Zhou supervised her team at night after they finished their sessions. According to Xiao Jinsong, head of the Hubei Psychological Consultant Association, the COVID-19 outbreak has underscored the importance of mental health counselors. He said that, unlike other disasters such as earthquakes or floods, this global public health crisis affects the entire economy and even relationships within households.  Music therapy, he said, works effectively as a rehabilitation method. “It affects our brain through music, allowing it to produce more relaxed emotions,” he said. “But it’s not a one-size-fits-all thing: Some music pieces might work for everyone, while some need to be more personalized ... and the effectiveness ultimately depends on the interactions between patients and therapists.” Ma Xiaohui, a Chinese erhu musician involved in organizing music therapy-related concerts and lectures across the country for more than a decade, said people in China now have a better awareness of mental health and are more open to attending such events, compared with about 12 years ago. Her sessions usually last for 90 to 120 minutes and have helped audiences share their thoughts with others and relax, she said. “Among all categories of art, music is the one that directly touches your nerves because it doesn’t need explanation,” she said. “It’s not like appreciating calligraphy or oil paintings, where you need to first understand the theory behind it. You can simply like the music and feel touched.” Younger music therapists in the team said their study and work with clients has helped them personally. While some are engaged in internships at local hospitals or care facilities for children or senior citizens, others have found work after graduating like specializing in providing counseling to children with autism. Wu Peixin, a sophomore in the team, moved to China after her piano teacher in Malaysia told her about the course. She feels music therapy is magical. “I think this major gives us the best way to find ourselves and understand a side within that we never knew about,” she said. “This makes us understand others better, and this becomes our strength.”  This is a playlist of relaxing music curated by SMC and published on its WeChat account Feb. 9, 2020.

46 People Linked to Beijing Market Test Positive for Coronavirus,The virus was reportedly first detected on a chopping board used for fish at the city’s largest farmers market.,2020-06-13,"A district in Beijing is now in “wartime” mode following the closure of a wholesale agriculture market that has been linked to a spike in locally transmitted infections of the COVID-19 virus over the past two days. At a press briefing Saturday, officials reported that 46 people connected to the Xinfadi market — the largest farmers market in China’s capital — had tested positive for the coronavirus. Forty-five of the infected work at the market, and the additional person is a close contact of someone who visited the market. None of the 46 who tested positive have shown symptoms. The Xinfadi market was closed at 3 a.m. Saturday, and authorities have ordered a mass inspection of the city’s meat products currently in circulation, targeting wholesale markets, restaurants, and grocery stores. Chu Junwei, a local official, said at the press briefing that Fengtai District, where Xinfadi is located, is now in “wartime emergency” mode. Around 140 close contacts of the newly identified cases have been put under quarantine. Meanwhile, 11 residential communities near the wholesale market will be sealed off, Chu said, and nearby kindergartens and primary schools will suspend classes. Since Thursday, Beijing has reported seven “confirmed infections” — a term used in China to refer to people who both test positive for the virus and show symptoms. One of the cases diagnosed Thursday had traveled outside the city, a local disease control official said. Five out of the six confirmed cases reported in Beijing Friday were people who worked at Xinfadi. There were 11 other confirmed infections elsewhere in China over the same two-day period, all among people arriving from abroad. The Beijing cluster seems to have spread to at least one other province. On Friday, Liaoning in northeastern China reported two asymptomatic infections, both of whom had been in contact with one of the people confirmed infected Friday in the capital. The coronavirus was first detected on a chopping board used for salmon, according to the chairman of Xinfadi market. After the local infections were announced, Beijing supermarkets including Carrefour reportedly removed their salmon products overnight. Before Thursday, Beijing had not reported a single coronavirus case for 56 days. The city will suspend sporting events and tour groups to other provinces, effective immediately, a spokesman said during the press briefing.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005801
"Under COVID-19, China’s Mask Market Surged. Now It’s Gone Bust.",Entrepreneurs say it’s becoming more difficult to recover their investments due to dwindling demand and plummeting prices.,2020-06-12,"In February, Chinese businessman Pan Changsheng invested 4 million yuan ($565,000) to convert his plastic packaging factory into a face mask production line. Back then, the coronavirus outbreak in China was at its peak. While most businesses were closed to prevent the disease from spreading, demand for personal protective equipment, including face masks, was sky-high. Entrepreneurs like Pan seized on the opportunity to cash in on the mask business. Now, some four months later, things have changed. “I’ve lost 1 million yuan,” Pan told Sixth Tone. As an essential item in limited supply, face masks became a prized commodity during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now infected over 7.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 420,000. The demand was so high that shops were sold out of masks for days. Meanwhile, cities scaled up production and rationed masks to prevent hoarding. But with the coronavirus now largely controlled in China and production lines back on track, the face mask shortage has subsided, and prices have dropped from 1 yuan each all the way down to 0.2 yuan, Pan said. He still has 2 million face masks in stock, waiting to be sold, at his warehouse in the eastern Anhui province. “At that time, many people saw an opportunity and got in on the business,” Pan said. “But now, many people have large stocks of masks and are suffering huge losses.”  As the virus spread globally, demand for masks was so high that even industrial giants, such as electric car manufacturer BYD, and state-owned oil companies joined the race to produce face masks for domestic and overseas markets. According to business data platform Tianyancha, over 76,000 face mask manufacturers registered as businesses between Jan. 1 and June 12 — nearly six times the number of face mask companies that registered in all of last year. Government statistics show that the daily output of heavy-duty N95 masks and non-N95 masks increased from 130,000 and 5.86 million, respectively, in early February to over 5 million and 200 million by the end of April. Meanwhile, profits for large-scale nonwoven manufacturers producing raw materials for masks increased by over 250% between January and April. The sector was so prosperous that some companies resorted to illicit means to scale up production and profits, resulting in substandard masks being widely sold online. In recent months, local authorities in several Chinese provinces have cracked down on suppliers for using substandard melt-blown fabric — the raw material used in masks — and arrested dozens for reselling their products at exorbitant prices. By April 24, China’s market supervision authority had seized nearly 90 million substandard face masks.  Hu Xiangyang, a raw material producer in the southern Guangdong province, told Sixth Tone that in the early days of the pandemic, demand exceeded his factory’s production capacity. Some clients, he recalled, were sending money to his company’s bank account to secure orders even before they had communicated with him or his staff. “Now, the fever has subsided,” Hu said. “Things have returned to normal.” The face mask market has stabilized now, or even receded, jeopardizing the millions of yuan in investments made by entrepreneurs like Pan. A warning from China’s national textile industry association earlier this month underscored that the global demand for anti-epidemic materials had peaked and passed, further fraying investors’ nerves. “When the demand (for face masks) shot up, many people entered the business to make a quick buck,” Han Jing, deputy director of the China Nonwovens and Industrial Textiles Association’s publicity department, told Sixth Tone. “Many of those companies entered the industry from outside. Some of them may be able to stick around if they … can adapt to the market. But some will call it quits sooner or later.” Pan wouldn’t say how much money he made by switching from plastic packaging to face masks, but he’s expecting swift fallout from the plummeting demand. For now, he has decided to suspend his mask manufacturing unit. He hopes the government will help him sell the 2 million masks he still has in stock, as well as the 4 million yuan worth of machinery that’s now sitting idle. “I feel cheated,” Pan said. “The machines are of poor quality. Nobody wants to buy them anymore.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005781
Lab Work Suggests Wuhan’s 300 Positive COVID-19 Cases Not Infectious,"No live virus was detected among the 300 individuals, whose positive tests might have resulted from dead virus or RNA fragments.",2020-06-10,"The 300 people who tested positive for the coronavirus during Wuhan’s citywide screening campaign are “not contagious,” health authorities in the central Chinese city announced Tuesday. According to an official notice, no live virus was cultured from the 300 individuals’ sputum and throat swab samples during testing at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “If viral loads in the carriers are extremely low, or if it’s dead virus or remnants of the virus, then live virus cannot be cultured,” the release said, citing a health official. It added that the group’s more than 1,000 close contacts had all tested negative for the coronavirus. Scientists have speculated that people without symptoms of COVID-19 could still be able to transmit the virus. A March article in the New England Journal of Medicine said that an asymptomatic person in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong was found to be carrying a viral load similar to those of 17 sick patients in the study group, suggesting transmission potential among people with mild or no symptoms. On Tuesday, a senior official from the World Health Organization clarified that asymptomatic transmission rates aren’t yet known. A day earlier, she had caused a stir by suggesting that asymptomatic spread occurs but is “very rare.” Some of the debate surrounding whether people who aren’t sick but test positive for the coronavirus can spread it to others comes down to how “asymptomatic infection” is defined, experts say. “The term ‘asymptomatic patient’ is pretty vague,” Lu Hongzhou, a virologist at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone. “Live virus, dead virus, and RNA fragments can all yield positive nucleic acid tests.” According to Lu, there needs to be a distinction between people who are completely asymptomatic but test positive because of viral remnants and people who have recently caught the virus but not yet developed symptoms. The 300 people who tested positive in Wuhan likely fall into the former category, he said. “Shedding viral remnants can take two or three months,” Lu said. “The people tested positive, but it (the virus) didn’t invade cells in the cultures, which means it’s not live, and therefore not infectious.” Only sporadic COVID-19 cases are being detected in China these days, although concerns of a resurgence persist. In a recent paper published in the British medical journal The Lancet, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the country must continue to take aggressive measures to prevent a rebound, “particularly in view of the high population susceptibility.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005789
Stay or Go? COVID-19 Forces Students to Rethink Study Abroad Plans,"All over China, students are deciding whether to move overseas for university. In the age of COVID-19, the choice is more complex than ever.",2020-06-05,"Kat Chu was thrilled when she received the email in February: She’d been offered a place at University College London to study computer science. For the 23-year-old from the eastern Zhejiang province, a place in a master’s program at a top British university represented a life-changing opportunity. She remembers sitting down with her family and excitedly discussing the preparations she’d need to make for her move to Europe. Then, a few weeks later, her parents had a sudden change of heart. “With the global spread of COVID-19 and the situation overseas getting worse, my parents said maybe I shouldn’t go abroad,” Chu tells Sixth Tone. “They said if I went there, they’d be worrying about me day and night.” At first, Chu thought she’d be able to convince her parents to let her go. After all, they’d spent over 100,000 yuan ($14,000) on private lessons and agent fees to help prepare her application.  But her parents’ worries intensified after they heard a story about the child of a family friend, who was stuck in the United Kingdom and unable to find a flight back to China. They insisted Chu reject the offer. Unable to pay the tuition fees herself, the young student’s dream ended. “It was so difficult for me to get in. I felt it was such a pity,” says Chu. “But my parents are taking a tough stance … They just want me to find a job.” All over China, thousands of families are having similar discussions as students mull over whether to accept offers to study abroad. While an overseas education remains hugely attractive to many in the country, the pandemic is making some hesitant to leave home. Others, meanwhile, are being forced to rethink their plans due to the ongoing disruptions to examinations, visa applications, and international travel. The decisions these families make over the coming weeks will have far-reaching implications for universities across the English-speaking world, many of which are heavily reliant on the tuition fees paid by Chinese students. China is the world’s largest source of international students, with 1.5 million people studying abroad as of 2018. The number of scholars departing each year has been growing steadily over the past decade, reaching 660,000 in 2018. The rise has been driven by the willingness of middle-class Chinese to invest huge sums to give their kids a head start in life. Many value foreign universities’ ability to offer students immersion in a multilingual environment, all-round personal development, and an edge in the Chinese job market.  In the age of COVID-19, however, some families’ priorities have shifted. In a February survey of over 100 China-based study abroad agencies, 65% said they expected the number of students going overseas to decline this year. Over 35% said they thought students were likely to scrap their plans to leave China due to the coronavirus. Many Chinese students are applying to start their programs a year later, hoping the global situation will have stabilized by 2021, according to Jon Santangelo, a spokesperson for the Beijing Overseas Study Service Association (BOSSA), the international education body that conducted the February survey. “Students for the first time are choosing a gap year, which in China is practically unheard of,” Santangelo tells Sixth Tone. “The majority of agencies have confirmed they’re receiving fewer student inquiries compared to last year.” Liu Bo, a mentor at Palm Drive, an education institution that helps Chinese students applying to elite universities in the U.S. and U.K., says several clients have withdrawn their applications completely, while others are trying to defer.  “The pandemic has brought too much uncertainty,” he says. “Still, there are many people who’ve decided to keep going.” Students’ reasons for changing their plans vary, according to Liu. Fears of the virus are a common issue, as is a reluctance to pay eye-watering tuition fees when there’s a chance they’ll have to attend online classes. A semester of Zoom-based lectures was enough to convince Wang Jingzhou to consider putting off his graduate studies. The 23-year-old completed a four-year degree in the U.S. in May and is due to start a master’s program in the U.K. this fall. But he’s still thinking about deferring a year. His new university has told him classes will resume in September, but some lectures will still take place online. He’s also worried about potential problems getting a U.K. visa, flying to London, and finding accommodation in the city. “It’s not cost-effective for us to pay the same tuition fees but have virtual teaching,” Wang tells Sixth Tone. “I think it’s not as efficient as face-to-face discussion.” With his U.S. graduation ceremony postponed, Wang caught a grueling 48-hour flight back to China via the Netherlands — a journey that, in his words, made him feel like a character in the video game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, forced to flee into an ever-shrinking safe zone. If he does defer, Wang says he’ll spend a year in China doing an internship or starting a business. “I’ll make the final decision in August,” he says.  While most younger applicants are willing to wait a year to enroll and see if the pandemic-related problems dissipate, graduates sometimes choose to pursue a different path altogether. “Affected by the pandemic, some students who applied for a master’s degree changed their minds as they have more choices,” says Liu, the student mentor. “Besides taking a gap year, they could study for their master’s at a domestic university, or enter the job market.” But Claire Wang, who isn’t related to Wang Jingzhou, tells Sixth Tone she’s determined to stick to her original plan. The former bank employee has already taken a year to prepare her graduate school applications, and she’s set on doing whatever it takes to begin a master’s at a foreign college this year. “I found the bank job didn’t suit me, and studying abroad will help me find a better job,” she says. “Some students might want to defer till next spring, but I don’t want to do that.” Claire Wang has received a conditional offer from a university in the U.K. and has already taken a PTE Academic English test. If her results aren’t good enough, she plans to retake the test in June. “I have to spare no pains,” she says. “I can’t waste any time.” For others, however, taking tests — let alone retaking them — is impossible in the current climate. A significant number of applicants are being affected by administrative problems caused by the pandemic. According to the BOSSA survey, 40%-60% of Chinese students have been directly impacted by disruptions to college applications, visa processes, or travel policies.  The pandemic struck at the worst possible time for college applicants. Most U.K. and U.S. universities require non-native English speakers to obtain a certain score in the TOEFL or IELTS language tests, but many examination centers in China, Europe, and North America have been suspended for months. U.S. and U.K. visa application centers in China have also been shuttered for long periods, though several U.K. centers recently reopened. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, have been forced to drastically reduce the number of international flights, causing further issues for students looking to start courses abroad. The restrictions have already cost Linyu, a 25-year-old graduate, a place at his preferred college. The student received a conditional offer from The University of Chicago requiring him to obtain a higher TOEFL score in February, but he was unable to re-sit the test, despite four months of continuous efforts. In the end, he was able to secure a spot at another elite university instead, but he was bitterly disappointed to miss out on the chance to go to Chicago. He’d spent two years preparing his application, he tells Sixth Tone.  “I’d finally earned my place, then I failed again because of the pandemic,” says Linyu, whose name has been changed due to privacy concerns. “Sometimes there’s no rhyme or reason to life.” Chinese students about to graduate from overseas universities, meanwhile, are facing a whole different set of challenges. Many hoped to stay in their adopted countries and start their careers overseas, but the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 is making this extremely challenging. Vera Li, a 22-year-old graduate, has applied for 400 jobs in the U.S. since completing her diploma at an American college in December, but has received few replies. “I’m not even considering what the position or location is,” says Li. “Whenever there’s any opening, I’ll go for it.” In March, Li passed a final interview at a tech company in Washington, D.C., but the employer still hasn’t sent her an official offer. The firm has instituted a hiring freeze — as have 37% of U.S. employers, according to a March survey by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. For now, Li is cutting her daily expenses while she desperately searches for work. But she’s started to accept that unless something comes up soon, she might have to move back to China. “It’s really brought me a bad headache,” she says.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005763
Staying Positive in Quarantine,The author — CEO of an ed tech company that does business between the U.S. and China — reflects on how the past few months have changed her outlook.,2020-06-05,"I arrived home in New York City on Jan. 20. I had just attended a trade show in Las Vegas followed by a quick New Year’s staff meeting to rev up members of my team based in Silicon Valley, and I planned to spend a week recharging — in between more investor and consultant meetings — before a business trip to China. That was 136 days, six canceled flights, and one extortionate ticket sale offer ago. It’s the first time I’ve stayed in one place for more than a month in the past five years. The truth is, up to this point I’ve had a smooth life. After graduating from the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, I was accepted by Columbia University for a fully funded doctorate in applied mathematics. Six years ago, I started an educational services company that now works with thousands of schools across more than 40 countries and regions. I’ve given keynote speeches at Davos and UNESCO, and for years through my company I’ve helped sponsor one of Silicon Valley’s most influential conferences for artificial intelligence in education. Throughout that time, I’ve survived by being a hardcore rationalist, making decisions based on facts rather than emotions. This is partly my nature, and partly the result of years of mental training. A colleague once called me “more man than a man” — a compliment, apparently — and I have been mocked by others as a “robot.” For example, about two years ago, mounting staffing and interpersonal issues during the first three years of my company’s growth led to a major internal crisis. One of my investors kindly flew out to California to comfort me in person. “You can cry out all the stress. It’s OK,” he said to me. But I was just confused, “Cry? Why? Can crying solve any of (my) problems?” But this time, the shock felt overwhelming. As early as February, I warned my team that our first-quarter income from China was likely to be wiped out when schools were inevitably delayed. (This prediction turned out to be true.) “Thankfully we (still) have the U.S. and global market,” I remember thinking to myself. The novel coronavirus soon spread, however, and started a global pandemic. In March, I had to share with my team that we were looking at a loss of about half of our 2020 global revenue. Theoretically, all business challenges can be dissected and translated into operating costs, resources, and time. So on an operational level, finding a solution to our challenges began from how to ship products, keep contracts, and develop new clients. From there we started exploring new channels for bringing businesses online while providing valuable services to new and existing clients. I spent late January and much of February shifting tasks between my China and U.S. teams; then from the end of February to late March, we were busy looking for new revenue streams. But by the end of the month, I realized that all the assumptions we built the company upon had to be rethought and reanalyzed. The world had been forever changed by COVID-19. Previously, we relied on leads generated at large trade shows and conferences such as CES and Curiosity, then visited potential clients to seal the deal. And after the contract was signed, we carried out deployment and tech training on-site. Not anymore. Now I find myself asking: What are the most important problems faced by my company, my users, and my clients, and how do we go about solving them? What will the market be like after the pandemic? But honestly, I have no clue. And things are only getting worse. Tensions between China and the U.S. continue to escalate. As a Chinese woman who started her business in the U.S. and has been a beneficiary of Sino-American scientific and technological cooperation, the situation is disheartening. Even though my company’s technology was developed mainly for the educational sector and has already cleared U.S. investment hurdles, I see no good in regulations that make international trade, as well as talent and capital exchange, more difficult. But all I can do is stay rational and try to come up with solutions, no matter how challenging the situation gets. During my time in New York, I’ve turned to philosophy: stoicism, essentialism, antifragility, even Zen and wabi-sabi — though sometimes I take half a day off to blast Lizzo and Imagine Dragons as loud as my speakers will allow, until my frontal lobe is ready to take control again. As it turns out, the past few months sheltering in place have made even a so-called robot like me yearn for humanity. I want to hug my family and friends. I miss my cat. I’ve even started to read novels and watch romantic movies. I’ve come to realize that quality and service are not always about price, profit margin, and growth rate. It’s about making life lovely, warm, and humane. We should be meeting real needs, not inventing fake ones. My favorite part of the day is the daily round of applause for first responders and medical workers at 7 p.m. It’s become an important meditative time for me, one where I can connect with my fellow humans. I keep a replica niao zun, a famous phoenix-shaped drinking vessel from the Shang dynasty, atop my fireplace. Sometimes I look at it and murmur: “May the phoenix rise from the ashes” — a quiet prayer for a day when things make sense again.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005751
"First She Beat the Virus. Now, She’s Battling Its Stigma.","Testing positive cost Jiajia two jobs in mere months, even as society turned away.",2020-06-04,"SHANGHAI — From her COVID-19 hospital bed in Shanghai around mid-February, Jiajia took to a social app to say the virus was not invincible. She meant it as a message of hope. She never expected it to cost her a job. Posting on her feed on WeChat — China’s popular social networking app — she said the battle against the coronavirus was akin to recovering from a cold. Nearly two months later, just before she was to start a new job as a clinical trial coordinator at a top Shanghai hospital, she realized that a doctor there had learned of her COVID-19 history from the WeChat post. “The doctor shared this with nurses at the hospital. Within days, rumors spread that an asymptomatic carrier was coming to work. They all panicked,” said the 30-year-old. Her employer — a private company — then consulted the hospital’s infectious diseases department, which concluded it was possible for recovered COVID-19 patients to test positive again. “There’s no way that my employer would take on the hospital for me,” Jiajia said. “They told me to leave after I worked there for four days but paid me half a month’s salary.”  Jiajia’s ordeal underscores what some coronavirus patients have had to face: Recovery is when the hard part begins — getting back to their lives and grappling with the social stigma the disease leaves behind. To compound the issue, this was the second job Jiajia had lost since she recovered from COVID-19 late February. Jiajia says the pharmaceutical company she was working for when she tested positive “forced her to quit” just seven days after she was discharged from the hospital. “I hate myself for writing that message,” Jiajia, who asked not to disclose her surname out of privacy concerns, told Sixth Tone late in May. “I’m more than capable, but I lost my job because of someone’s discrimination and selfishness,” she said, bursting into tears. By June 3, 661 of the total 673 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Shanghai were discharged after recovering, and none experienced recurring positives — an issue once alarming in the central Hubei province, where the virus first broke out in China. According to Shen Yinzhong — a member of a team of Shanghai experts on COVID-19 prevention, control, and clinical treatment — asymptomatic carriers are infectious, while recovered patients don’t pose any threats to others. “If they were still infectious, we wouldn’t discharge them (from the hospital),” he said. For the Shanghai hospital job, Jiajia had passed all the necessary physical checkups, and her health code was green, indicating she was healthy enough to work or travel. “I didn’t violate any rules. I am a recovered patient, not a silent carrier. I was surprised that despite being medical professionals, they are sometimes ignorant.” She did, however, admit that she’d hidden her infection history from the private company. And she’s not alone, considering most COVID-19 survivors prefer not talking about the infection to avoid the inevitable stigma that follows.  Such is the case with Maomao, who was also treated in Shanghai and also asked not to disclose his surname for privacy reasons. “Given the widespread fear of the new virus, I know it can bring about unnecessary trouble,” the 24-year-old said. “I didn’t even tell my parents about it to save them from worries.” Jiajia and Maomao are both members of a WeChat group, comprising over 100 recovered COVID-19 patients who had been treated in Shanghai. Others in the group have also echoed similar sentiments. “I was devastated that I lost a job simply because I was once infected. The company had told me that with my years of experience, I was the best candidate for the job,” said Jiajia. “I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t figure out what mistakes I’d made.” Jiajia spoke to Sixth Tone on May 20. The next day, she started a new job — her third in three months. “This time, I chose a smaller company, which collaborates with lesser-known hospitals in Shanghai. It means there is little chance I’ll be recognized,” she said. After the virus cost her two jobs, she’d even contemplated new avenues to make ends meet. “I considered becoming a food-delivery driver or a customer service staff member. The salary might’ve been around 3,000 yuan ($420), a lot lower than the 10,000 yuan I could easily earn as a coordinator. That would’ve been better than nothing.”  Since her husband spends his time at home taking care of their daughter, the family depends on Jiajia’s income. “We aren’t well-off, but we were able to cover our daily expenses with my income in the past.” Originally from the eastern Jiangsu province, Jiajia moved to Shanghai five years ago as a clinical trial coordinator. Her job is based inside hospitals, selecting potential candidates for clinical trials of new drugs, managing patients’ files, and uploading data. “It’s such an active market, and it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find a job,” she said. “The pandemic poses challenges to other industries, but the health sector, on the contrary, has become more vibrant.” Despite working in a promising industry, it’s taken three months for Jiajia’s life to limp back to normal since getting discharged. In her opinion, everything comes down to her coronavirus infection history. It all started Jan. 23, on her way back home to Jiangsu from a business trip to Hangzhou in the eastern Zhejiang province. Jiajia spent two hours on a bus with a passenger from Wuhan, the original center of the pandemic. Four days later, the passenger tested positive for COVID-19. And Jiajia began her 14-day quarantine with her large family, including her 2-year-old child, in their apartment in suburban Shanghai. She lives with her parents-in-law and her brother-in-law’s family of three — eight total under one roof. On the last day of her quarantine period, Jiajia developed a slight fever of 37.1 degrees Celsius. She tested positive two days later. “I wasn’t feeling unwell at all, but I felt so guilty. Right after I tested positive, my whole family was quarantined — my husband in a hospital and the others in a hostel,” she recalled. “They were scared. And I was under huge pressure.”  With only mild symptoms, Jiajia spent just 11 days in the hospital before meeting all standards for recovery. She was discharged on Feb. 21. She calls this the darkest day of her life. “I felt the hostility from society,” she said. “I was discharged at 9 a.m. I spent the entire day outdoors, hesitant about where I should go. Hotels didn’t accept me. I asked the residential committee to help arrange a place for me to live in for the next 14 days of observation, because if I went back home, my whole family would have had to stay at home for another two weeks. This would have forced them to stop working.” As real estate agents, it’s impossible for her brother-in-law and his wife to work from home. “Eventually they (the residential committee) didn’t help. I returned home around midnight.” A fortnight later, Jiajia took her daughter downstairs for a walk, only to find her neighbors trying to stay as far away as possible. “I could tell they found me disturbing. I was experiencing a vicious world that I’d never known before.”  Back in October 2019, Jiajia got a job at a private pharmaceutical company that employs thousands in Shanghai. Just before she tested positive early February, Jiajia had completed her three-month probation. With the country’s top human resources authority urging all employers to pay confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients as well as any close contacts of confirmed patients their full salaries on time, Jiajia said she was paid adequately throughout the quarantine, treatment, and medical observation periods. But it was after she was discharged that things took a turn for the worse. Her work supervisor harshly criticized her performance and even asked if she deserved to keep her job. “It didn’t happen just once or twice. My supervisor kept calling me saying I was very bad at my job, and I should resign instead of waiting to be fired. Though I was his subordinate, I have self-esteem. Every person deserves respect,” she said, breaking down again. Pressured, she resigned on Feb. 28, assuming it was simply a result of her disappointing performance. It was when she went back to the office to return the company’s assets that she realized it was something more sinister. “My supervisor stopped me from coming too close and sprayed sanitizer on my entry card right in front of me. It’s hard to describe what I felt then,” she said. Jiajia was angry about how she’d been treated. She even considered legal remedies but couldn’t come up with hard evidence. “My job falls under the direct supervision of the company’s compliance department. It’s the very department that knows what might bring about legal risks,” she said. “Throughout the whole process, my supervisor never mentioned a word about my COVID-19 history. The tricky part is that they didn’t openly fire me but used other methods to force me to quit.”  Lawyers specializing in labor disputes told Sixth Tone that it’s very common for employers to use reasons other than COVID-19 to turn their staff away. “In the cases I received, employers reduced salary, adjusted their posts, or relocated them in an effort to force them to resign,” said lawyer He Fei with Beijing Jintai Law Firm. Since March, she has received eight cases on discrimination involving former COVID-19 patients. “Employees are usually not aware enough to collect evidence. They sometimes provide WeChat messages, phone recordings, or testimony from co-workers. But if this material cannot form an evidence chain, they don’t help in lawsuits,” said He. “Employees commonly feel the cost of defending their rights through legal methods is too high. And during this extraordinary period, most don’t want to spend too much time or energy on it.”  Wang Jue with Zhong Yin Law Firm advised employees to ask their firms for written requests. “If the employer only verbally notifies staff about his or her change of post, reduced salary, or dismissal, the staff should write an email for a formal company reply to the decision and the reasons behind it,” she said. “They should try to take the lead in such issues instead of just being passive.” According to Jiajia, most of her former colleagues treated her well when she returned to the office. But even one person’s prejudice can cause a lot of harm to a recovered COVID-19 patient. “As long as he (her supervisor) treated me as a potential risk, he would’ve tried any means necessary to get rid of me. I didn’t see any advantages in filing a labor arbitration case,” she said. In the two months between jobs, Jiajia went to shopping malls, parks, and supermarkets and took the metro on numerous occasions. “But I didn’t infect anyone. I can’t imagine why they have such low confidence in Shanghai’s health system — they discharged me, as I had properly recovered and I’m safe and sound.” Jiajia also has a question: “Now that those with severe symptoms have recovered and returned to work in Hubei, why can’t we (who suffered just mild symptoms) continue our normal lives?”  Employed as a copilot by a domestic airline, Maomao, the 24-year-old recovered patient, also said he faced discrimination at work, though he wasn’t fired like Jiajia. Instead, he was suspended and even ordered not to return to the office to access his personal belongings. He, too, has similar concerns. “Is there any way health professionals can help educate the public that people who’ve recovered from COVID-19 are safe and pose no threat to society?” “We’ve never stopped making such efforts,” said Shen, the member of the team of Shanghai prevention and control experts, who is also the director of medical affairs at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and closely monitors discharged patients. “I would say the public in Shanghai is generally well-informed about the virus and recovered patients, but a few might still feel concerned.”  He said so far none of the 670-plus recovered patients in Shanghai had redeveloped a fever or infected other people. “From Jan. 27, when the first recovered patients were discharged, we’ve required them to come back for revisits after two and four weeks. We applied the highest standards managing both existing and recovered patients.” In such revisits, Shen said many had reported psychological challenges — though recovered, they became mentally vulnerable. Some were scared of having infected their families shortly after being discharged, later anxious about social discrimination. But based on existing clinical observations and studies, Shen said: “Around 10 days from the onset of the disease, a COVID-19 patient is no longer infectious. … In the WeChat groups of our recovered patients, some spoke of the challenges in getting back to life. But over the months, several have gotten over this difficult period.” With life in Shanghai slowly returning to normal, Jiajia, in mid-May, was offered a job by a smaller company, which is likely to send her to lower-tier hospitals to coordinate clinical trials. “I don’t know what awaits me. But things are definitely getting better,” she said. Looking back over the last three months, she said: “Selfishness is a part of mankind’s nature. I can understand them (those who mistreated her) if I look at the matter from their perspective.” Despite the ups and downs, Jiajia said 2020 hasn’t been her worst year, and that she’s been inspired to think more about life and reality. “When I was left jobless, I thought I witnessed the evil in mankind. But I’ve now found a new job, and I’m more convinced than ever that such evil lies with just a minority of people.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005759
"The Workshop of the World, Unraveled","In China’s largest clothing hub, migrant workers are struggling to deal with the economic shockwaves unleashed by COVID-19.",2020-06-03,"This is the first installment of Unraveled, a series of special reports from a Chinese clothing hub struggling to cope with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak. Watch the second video in the series here, the third part here, and the fourth part here. GUANGDONG, South China — In the heart of Guangzhou, there is a hidden world: a maze of small workshops, factories, and apartment blocks known as the “Hubei Villages.” The tens of thousands of companies based here all focus on manufacturing garments. It’s the largest clothing base in China, churning out items that fill racks across the country and around the world.  Around 1 in 3 workers at the factories are migrants from the same region: Hubei province. In late January, Hubei Villages emptied as people returned to their hometowns in central China for Spring Festival. They expected to spend a couple weeks celebrating the holiday with their families before returning to Guangzhou in time for the peak production season. Within days, however, Hubei province was overwhelmed by the rapid spread of COVID-19. The Chinese government locked down the entire region to contain the virus, preventing the population from exiting the province for months. When the control measures finally started to ease in late March, millions of migrants flooded back into Guangzhou. They arrived to find an altered economy. Factories were shuttered, work was scarce, and wages had fallen dramatically. Local landlords, however, still expected the rent to be paid on time. In April, Sixth Tone traveled to Guangzhou to investigate how the people of Hubei Villages are coping with life in the wake of China’s outbreak. This first report introduces the situation inside Hubei Villages in the weeks following the easing of China’s lockdown policies. Over the following days, we will release a series of videos focusing on the lives of different people in the area: a couple struggling to find work in the workshops; a factory boss trying to keep his business afloat; and another choosing to pick up the pieces elsewhere.

Second Chinese City to Reportedly Test Entire Population for COVID-19,Mudanjiang in the northeastern Heilongjiang province will aim to test all 2.8 million of its residents after detecting 15 asymptomatic cases last week.,2020-06-03,"The northeastern Chinese city of Mudanjiang has announced plans to expand the scale of its COVID-19 testing to assess some 2.8 million people, domestic media reported Tuesday. After Wuhan, the city in central China where the novel coronavirus was first detected, Mudanjiang will become the second city in the country to test virtually all of its residents. The announcement came after Mudanjiang reported 15 positive COVID-19 test results in people without symptoms last week. In April, the nearby city of Suifenhe — about two hours’ drive east of Mudanjiang — saw a spike in imported COVID-19 cases among residents returning from Russia. Because of the relative shortage of medical supplies in the city, all of its confirmed, symptomatic patients were transferred to hospitals in Mudanjiang for treatment. In the past few months, several cities in the northeastern Chinese provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, where Mudanjiang is located, have taken more stringent measures, including full and partial lockdowns, to stop the coronavirus from spreading. In May, the central city of Wuhan tested 9.9 million of its 11 million residents, reporting some 300 asymptomatic cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005753
Case by Case: A Lawyer Sifts Through China’s COVID-19 Fallout,Legal disputes related to the pandemic were more than enough to keep the author busy during quarantine.,2020-06-02,"Earlier this year, the COVID-19 outbreak brought my life as a traveling civil law attorney to a screeching halt. But unlike many, just because I couldn’t leave my Beijing home didn’t mean I was out of work. Prospective clients often reached out to me on microblogging platform Weibo, and as the economic ramifications of the now-pandemic rippled outward, messages from employers and workers continued to pour in from across China. Their stories are a window into some of the ways the past few months have turned people’s lives upside down. Wang is the owner of a noodle restaurant I’ve visited in the central city of Wuhan, itself the center of the epidemic in China. One of his restaurant’s specialties is “hot and dry noodles,” a regional delicacy I’m particularly fond of. In his message, sent in late February when the city was still in lockdown, he anxiously confided in me that he hadn’t sold a single meal in the last two months, even as he’d remained on the hook for rent and employees’ salaries. Although he was just managing to stay afloat, he worried his business would sink if the outbreak lasted any longer. He had asked his landlord for a rent exemption, only to be refused. “Legally speaking, do I have the right to apply to my landlord to reduce or delay my rent?” Wang asked me. The truth is, China’s legal community hasn’t arrived at a consensus regarding rent exemptions during a public health crisis. Most legal experts argue that it could constitute an instance of force majeure, justifying a tenant’s termination of their rental agreement. But the rules are one thing, the actual ramifications of such a decision another. If a business owner cancels a lease without a fallback plan for where to move next, they could face disaster. After laying out his options, I encouraged Wang to try talking to his landlord again. If Wang terminated his lease, his landlord would be hurt, too. “Since the worst possible outcome for both of you would be to end the lease, perhaps it would in the landlord’s interest to come to a compromise.” Wang said he’d try to talk it over again and hasn’t contacted me since. One of the only things more common than lease disputes during the outbreak were labor disputes. Labor dispute consultations usually peak around the Lunar New Year holiday, when many workers — especially migrants — finally collect their wages for the past year. At a time when everything felt different, this was one constant. In many cases, local governments extended the Lunar New Year holidays but left bosses and their workers to figure out the details: What did the extensions mean, legally? And did employers need to continue paying wages during this period? A retail worker sent me an inquiry. Like most people in his industry, his salary consists of a base amount and a commission. Lunar New Year was peak sales season: In previous years, his income from commissions was double the usual amount. That wasn’t happening this year, and his boss had also suspended his base salary, leaving him with no income whatsoever. This eventually led him to consider taking legal action. I could sense he was conflicted. Suing his boss would almost certainly get him fired, but he’d only ever worked in retail and wasn’t hopeful about finding a new position. As a lawyer, I could tell him how to go about suing his boss. But I couldn’t fix his underlying problem. I listed a number of legal provisions that would support his claim and reminded him of the things he needed to pay attention to throughout the proceedings. As to whether to file the claim or not — that was up to him. While some were anxious to return to work, others complained companies were reopening too soon. Zhang is a programmer for a software outsourcing company. After the prevention measures were relaxed in his area, his company chose to partially resume work in the office. (Other internet companies have indefinitely extended the option to work from home.) Zhang felt he’d gotten the short end of the stick: He was among the first of the employees at his job required to return to the office, but he was afraid of being infected. He asked me if there was a legal mechanism for resisting the order. I could sympathize with his plight. After Beijing lifted its lockdown, I went back to my usual pattern of traveling frequently for work. I worried about my risk of infection, too, but neither of us had much choice. Legally, as long as they have the government’s approval, firms can resume operations, and employees who refuse to comply are liable to face disciplinary action or even dismissal. For many workers, the outbreak has shed an unflattering light on the fragility of employer-employee relations. Struggling businesses have turned to creative, but not particularly worker-friendly solutions such as “employee sharing” to stay afloat, and the national government has revised its unemployment forecasts upward, signalling that millions may be out of work for the foreseeable future. Even in difficult times, however, some employers are doing their best to keep staff on the payroll. Li is a former classmate of mine who runs an auto garage that was forced to close amid the pandemic. Fortunately, Li owned the building, so he didn’t have to worry about rent. His only concern was paying his apprentices’ wages. Li told me he’d considered laying them off to cut costs, but he just didn’t have the heart. He’d also started off as a garage apprentice, living off meager wages in exchange for the chance to learn the trade. He hoped that, once the pandemic came to an end, they would remember his help and repay him by working hard. Virtually all requests for advice I received during this crisis stemmed from a failure to perform established legal agreements, whether leases or employment contracts. That is, until I received a very peculiar message on Weibo one day: “What legal matters should I pay attention to when opening a business?” I double-checked to make sure this wasn’t an old message from before, asking if she was serious. Who’d want to start a business now? The woman told me she wanted to open a flower shop. For some time, she had been selling flowers online as a side hustle and had come to realize she loved it more than her full-time job. I scrolled through her Weibo, and sure enough it was filled with photos of flowers. Clearly, this was someone who was passionate about floristry. She told me she had been planning to open a shop for a long time and had set aside a decent sum of money for the purpose. In early April, just before Qingming Festival — a traditional holiday when Chinese sweep their ancestral graves — she set a new one-day sales record, earning an amount equal to half her regular monthly salary. With landlords slashing their rents in an attempt to find new tenants, she decided now was the right time to quit her job and fulfill her dream. I briefed her on the do’s and don’ts of renting a storefront, paying taxes, and getting a business license. Every now and then, she’d ask me something else, and I’d give her more advice. From her questions, I could tell she was full of hope. Sometimes I think society is like a forest. Even when a fire seems to have swept everything away, new shoots are continuously rising up from the soil. My work is also picking up. After months working with clients over the phone and online, I can finally get on a plane and see them in person. There was a time when I didn’t enjoy business trips, but now I look forward to my next destination. And in every city I visit, I see a few more buds sprouting up.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005740
"Bat and Pangolin Coronaviruses Swapped RNA to Create COVID-19, Study Suggests",A coronavirus found in pangolins contains a crucial genetic component that SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade human cells.,2020-06-02,"The COVID-19 virus may have resulted from coronaviruses in bats and pangolins exchanging their genetic materials, Gao Feng, an infectious disease expert affiliated with Jilin University in northeastern China and Duke University in the U.S., told Sixth Tone on Monday. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, likely came from bats because of genetic similarities between it and a coronavirus found in certain populations of the flying mammals. However, how the bat virus evolved to infect humans remains a mystery, given that it lacks a key structure found in SARS-CoV-2 for binding effectively to human cells. Gao and his colleagues may have discovered a clue after comparing 43 genetic sequences in coronaviruses from bats, pangolins (a type of scaly anteater), and COVID-19 patients. According to a study published Friday in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, the team found that the part of the SARS-CoV-2 gene coding for the critical viral structure used to invade human cells was highly similar to that of a pangolin coronavirus. The rest of SARS-CoV-2, however, was significantly more similar to a bat coronavirus. To the researchers, this suggested that coronaviruses in bats and pangolins might have exchanged their genetic materials at some point via a process called recombination, giving rise to SARS-CoV-2. Genetic recombination in nature happens when different viruses encounter each other, usually in hosts. They swap some of their genetic materials, and this sometimes leads to the emergence of new viruses. “Recombination between viruses is very common,” Gao said. “It’s an important strategy viruses use to gain new traits that help them survive better.” But where the exchange occurred remains unknown, and pangolins may not be the intermediate host — the missing link between bats and humans. “This is a black box. The recombination may have occurred after bats spread their virus to pangolins, or pangolins gave their virus to bats, from which it then jumped to some other animals,” Gao said. “We don’t have enough animal samples to reach a definitive conclusion yet.” According to Gao, the coronaviruses that caused SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 — three major coronavirus disease outbreaks in humans — were all linked to genetic recombination between bats and other animals. Wet markets that house a variety of wild animals in close proximity provide a conducive environment for genetic reshuffling, and could lead to the emergence of more infectious viruses, Gao said. “While the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is still being sought, one thing is clear: reducing or eliminating direct human contact with wild animals is critical to preventing new coronavirus zoonosis in the future,” the authors wrote in their paper.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005744
Extreme Social Distancing: China Turns to Robots to Control COVID-19,Service robots are becoming a common sight on China’s coronavirus front lines as the country tries to avoid a second wave of infections.,2020-05-29,"SHANGHAI — Remote control in hand, Li Peng follows a white cylindrical machine as it glides along the corridor of a quarantine hotel in the eastern district of Pudong. The 23-year-old is helping the disinfection robot map out its new terrain. Once it has finished collecting the location data, it will begin patrolling the hotel autonomously, helping the center eliminate viral particles and reduce human contact that could unwittingly cause infections. The hotel is one of 34 facilities in Shanghai where people entering the city from abroad spend a mandatory 14 days of medical observation. “Robots can calculate the area that needs to be disinfected and figure out the best way to handle it,” Li says. “I hope the work we do can help protect medical staff striving on the front lines to combat COVID-19.”  The robots were developed by Taimi Robotics Technology Co. Ltd., a Shanghai-based firm that specializes in medical service robots. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, the company has sent around 300 machines to hospitals across China — including the original epicenter, Wuhan — to help sterilize wards, deliver medication, and check patients’ body temperatures. Li joined Taimi after graduating from college in in East China's Anhui provincei. He says he believes service robots will be deeply integrated into our future lives — from robots waking us up to tell us breakfast is ready, to coming home at night to find a robot has cleaned the house.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005735
Getting a Satellite’s-Eye View of China’s Economic Recovery,"As China attempts to rekindle economic activity, investors are using satellites to get the facts on the ground.",2020-05-26,"This article is part of a series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. With the initial battle to control COVID-19 now behind it, China is facing a very different challenge: restarting an economy devastated by several months of lockdowns, quarantines, and travel restrictions. The first step is getting the lay of the land. In the past, when carrying out investment research and financial analyses, investors were restricted to traditional statistics such as interest rates, the consumer price index, or the purchasing managers’ index — many of which are updated infrequently, sometimes only once a month. Now, alternative data sources, from sensors to geolocation tools, are giving observers new, real-time windows into the country’s economic health. Through the use of artificial intelligence and big data, investors can perceive, quantify, and predict economic changes as they happen, all of which could help improve decision-making relating to major societal and economic issues. Even within the field of alternative data, my area of expertise is a bit unique: satellites. As aerospace technology continues to mature, remote-sensing satellites are getting lighter, cheaper, and more plentiful. And the data from the vast majority of noncommercial satellites is accessible to anyone. As a result, investors such as myself can now obtain hourly updates on economic activity, beamed straight from space. Different types of satellites capture different types of images. For example, my team can use one kind of satellite to follow the construction of infrastructure, and another to check on economic activity by monitoring the intensity of night light within a given region. Sentinel 5P, which was launched in 2017 as part of the European Space Agency’s Copernicus program, tracks nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) emissions. Because an estimated 70%-80% of NO₂ emissions are the result of industrial production, it’s possible to use these images to infer how regional economies have been affected by COVID-19. In the past, the usability of satellite images was hampered by their technological limitations: Their cameras could be obscured by clouds or fog. But new synthetic-aperture radars can bypass these obstacles, allowing us to monitor the situation anywhere in the world, regardless of weather. Investors can speculate on trade conditions by observing changes in the number of cargo ships in ports, or ascertain the foot traffic of shopping malls by looking at the number of cars in the parking lot. To give a specific example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, my team analyzed the employee parking lot of the Tesla plant in Shanghai using data from China’s Gaofen-2 satellite. While there were only about 18 cars on Jan. 31, there were more than 100 by Feb. 10, confirming media reports that it had fully resumed operations.  Of course, even my team doesn’t have the time to sift through thousands upon thousands of high-resolution images for signs of economic recovery. Instead, we’ve enlisted the help of artificial intelligence. AI has the power to assess the crude oil reserves of a given nation based on the surface area and size of oil tanks in a particular area, or to recognize crops of corn, soybeans, and rice, and then predict their likely yield. It’s also made it possible for our team to use AI computer vision technology — a field of computational science focused on improving computers’ ability to understand images. With it, we can improve the accuracy of photovoltaic power station recognition in satellite images to over 94%, allowing us to track their installation nationwide.  On a broader scale, my team has developed a Satellite-based Manufacturing Index (SMI) to track changes and progress in China’s manufacturing sector. Take the production of steel, for example. Steel mills’ blast furnaces and electric furnaces operate at extremely high temperatures and generally warm their surroundings. On certain satellite images, these furnaces show up as clusters of bright red dots, allowing us to monitor steel mills’ operation and output. By analyzing satellite images of key steel mills from September 2019 to now, we found China’s steel industry had recovered from a low of 29% of baseline SMI to nearly 80% in mid-February, and was back up to 90% of the baseline by early March. But production has since fallen as the COVID-19 pandemic has cut into global demand. For my money, satellite images offer a treasure trove of information. During the pandemic, their promise of real-time, objective data on an immense scale without requiring human contact has been particularly alluring. Over the next few years, continual technological advancements will likely further reduce the cost of satellite data. Currently, all satellite data is transmitted back to receiving stations and data centers on the ground for processing and analysis. Perhaps one day, we will be able to put a chip with an AI algorithm into satellites so they can analyze images while in orbit and only transmit the information we need. That’s years and several highly complex technological solutions away, but I believe it’s only a matter of time.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005705
"When Companies ‘Share’ Staff, Workers Lose Out","Loaning out employees helped a number of Chinese businesses weather the COVID-19 storm, but it shouldn’t be the new normal.",2020-05-21,"From the widespread adoption of telecommuting to mass unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic is radically altering — some might say undermining — labor relations across the globe. But if tech evangelists see the current moment as a chance to overturn long-standing norms and usher in an age of flexible, efficient employment, governments should be careful not to adopt short-term fixes without considering the long-term risks. In China, the pandemic’s economic fallout has given rise to a new corporate buzzword: “employee sharing.” The idea first cropped up in February, when most cities were under varying degrees of lockdown or quarantine. As the outbreak stretched from days into weeks, stagnating offline consumption, employees’ inability to get back to work and unfunded local government mandates requiring firms to pay their employees for the duration of the shutdown left much of the private sector on life support. The service and manufacturing industries were hit especially hard. In early February, Chinese restaurant chain Xibei reported that 20,000 of its employees were idle, and it only had enough operating capital to pay wages and other costs for an additional three months. Meanwhile, online delivery and logistics platforms found themselves short-staffed as digital orders spiked. Xibei soon announced it had reached an agreement to “lend out” hundreds of employees to the fresh food delivery firm Hema Xiansheng. Xibei workers who agreed to undergo an interview, training, and physical examination and take temporary positions with Hema would have their wages paid by the delivery platform. Other firms soon followed suit. Within a month, more than 4,000 people signed up for retail giant Suning’s “talent-sharing” plan, and Walmart announced it had recruited nearly 2,000 prospective employees after partnering with catering enterprises nationwide. E-commerce site JD.com and appliance manufacturer Haier also took on workers from businesses severely impacted by the epidemic. Even the national government endorsed the model, with the country’s social security department permitting companies to share staff as long as the original employer was not “lending out employees for a profit.” Some observers have since suggested the practice could outlast the pandemic, heralding a new trend in human resources in which employees do not belong to a single enterprise, but are shared between multiple enterprises or across platforms. Employee sharing did alleviate some of the difficulties faced by enterprises at the peak of China’s epidemic, while helping the country manage the associated spike in idle workers. However, if employee sharing is to go from exigency to a potential vision of the future, it’s important to understand the potential risks involved. Shared employees may work at their new company for months at a time. They are subject to its management rules and must obey its regulations. This is a labor relationship and should be governed by a new labor contract. That’s not what’s happening, however: Many shared employees do not sign contracts with the firm that has “borrowed” them. This poses problems for regulators. For example, if a worker sues a company with which they do not have a labor contract, how should the labor arbitration system or judiciary respond? And if a shared employee is injured while working at their new company, who is responsible? Employee sharing is an outgrowth of “labor dispatching” and other flexible employment methods that have existed in China since the 1990s. Companies see these models as a way to cut costs and transfer labor risks from employer to employee. In return, they claim flexible employment gives workers more autonomy. The truth is much bleaker. A combination of big data, ratings, rewards, and punishments allows platforms to exert utter control over their informal workforces while evading responsibility for social security payments and other welfare costs associated with formal employment. This leaves China’s 70 million flexibly employed workers to face the risks of workplace injuries, illness, and retirement alone. The corporate sector has the leverage to make this happen in part because many manufacturing jobs have been offshored to Southeast Asia in recent years. Migrants who used to work in factories now do odd jobs for digital platforms, often without formal contracts. Indeed, many gig economy workers already work for several different platforms simultaneously — a kind of informal precursor to employee sharing. The past decade has seen formal employment in China’s labor market steadily fall, while flexible employment arrangements have grown more common. The percentage of migrant workers signing formal labor contracts declined from 42.8% in 2009 to 35.1% in 2016. Meanwhile, freelancing, self-employed, and flexibly employed workers went from a combined 4% of the labor force in 2003 to 18.7% in 2017. At a time of economic uncertainty, having a job, even an informal one, is obviously better than being unemployed. But if models like employee sharing linger on past the current crisis, they could further destabilize labor relations. For example, if sharing employees is seen as a viable method for cutting costs, companies may start laying off staff and slashing wages, knowing they can still access flexible pools of workers. If that happens, labor disputes are likely to explode. Furthermore, unstable employment situations are a source of psychological pressure and anxiety, affecting not just workers, but their families as well. The pandemic has resulted in a vicious cycle, in which the government lets enterprises bear market risks, enterprises pass these risks to workers, and workers spread these risks to society. Local governments must urge enterprises to extend leniency to workers affected by the pandemic. At the same time, officials need to provide enterprises with real relief, whether in the form of tax cuts, reduced social security contributions, lower rent, or financial assistance. In the short term, instead of overturning the country’s entire labor system, policymakers should seek solutions in existing labor law. In the long run, they should pay more attention to the risks and vulnerabilities faced by workers in an increasingly gig-oriented economy. If China allows manufacturing to decline in favor of the service sector, it will see the same hollowing out of society that has taken place in other postindustrial economies. That will make it difficult to safeguard today’s gig workers and provide them with steady, secure employment.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005690
A Brief History of Chinese ‘Health Diplomacy’,"Foreign aid should be about helping other countries “stand up,” as Zhou Enlai once said, not political gamesmanship.",2020-05-20,"The People’s Republic of China has engaged in “health diplomacy” almost since its founding in 1949. Over the course of the 1950s and ’60s, a still-impoverished China sent a total of 6,500 trained medical personnel on assistance missions to over 40 countries and funded the construction of more than 20 medical institutions around the world. Back then, China’s willingness to spend on foreign aid was driven by a need to find and foster friends amid the tense atmosphere of the Cold War. Guided by the principle of “the poor helping the poor” and an idealistic commitment to national liberation and self-reliance, China dispatched medical teams to African countries and helped fortify the medical infrastructure of fellow communist states like Mongolia. In the words of the country’s premier and lead diplomat, Zhou Enlai: “We would provide sincere help to any independent country. Our assistance is to make (that) country able to stand up.” These principles also influenced China’s attitudes toward aid offers from developed countries. National leaders’ desire for self-reliance made them reluctant to accept outside help, with the early exception of technical assistance from the Soviet Union. Even after China joined the World Health Organization in the early 1970s, it continued to rebuff WHO offers of aid out of a desire to show its independence — as well as generosity to other nations in need.  This high-minded approach to international aid changed drastically with the advent of the “reform and opening-up” period in 1978. Outgoing health assistance was reframed not as a political issue, but as an opportunity for mutually beneficial technical cooperation. The number of medical teams China sent overseas dropped between the late ’70s and ’90s, as the country began requiring recipient countries to bear some of the costs associated with relief work. Meanwhile, China was becoming more open to the idea of receiving assistance, including health aid, from outside its borders. Traditional providers of development assistance, including the World Bank, United Nations, and advanced economies, grew increasingly involved in the design and development of China’s health and disease control systems. They provided the country with loans, funding for medical facilities, and free technical training and medical supplies. This aid proved hugely beneficial, not least in helping the country bring its hepatitis B epidemic under control. One 1992 study estimated almost 10% of Chinese had been infected with hepatitis B, in part because the country was unable to produce or purchase the vaccine in sufficient quantities. Pharmaceutical company Merck originally planned to market its hepatitis B vaccine in China, but soon concluded the price was far higher than the average Chinese family could afford. Instead, it transferred the associated technologies for just $7 million — which it then spent on building a manufacturing plant in the country and carrying out training. By 2014, the prevalence of hepatitis B among Chinese children under the age of 5 had dropped to 0.32%. The next watershed moment in the development of China’s public health and international development strategies was the 2003 SARS epidemic. That coronavirus-caused disease killed almost 350 people on the Chinese mainland and had a profound impact on both the national economy and society. Among other revelations, severe acute respiratory syndrome woke China up to the reality of how public health crises could affect its international image. The country soon began reemphasizing health cooperation in its international development agenda, this time with a greater focus on working through multilateral institutions like the WHO. Taking advantage of a booming economy over the next few years, the Chinese government scaled up aid for developing countries. For example, in 2009, China committed to providing medical equipment, supplies, and trained medics to dozens of hospitals and anti-malaria institutions in Africa. And after the 2014 Ebola outbreak, China not only actively offered emergency humanitarian assistance, but also participated in the development and construction of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the health agency of the African Union. In short, Chinese attitudes toward international health cooperation have varied over the years, according to both its own material conditions and its relations with the outside world. But the recent trend has been toward integration with the international system for mutual benefits. The global fight against COVID-19 has done little to alter this stance. China has focused on fulfilling its obligations as a responsible member of the international community, including by offering health assistance to other nations struggling to bring the disease under control. At present, China has provided aid to over 140 countries, sent several medical teams overseas, and made two donations totaling $50 million to the WHO. Some international critics have tarred this aid as a cynical means of boosting the country’s geopolitical standing or an attempt to cover up for earlier policy failings. Others have cast suspicion on efforts made by charitable groups and associations early in the pandemic to buy and ship needed protective gear to Chinese hospitals. A look at the history of Chinese development aid suggests the country’s actions are merely a continuation of past trends. And in fact, much of its recent outgoing aid mirrors the significant help China received from countries and international organizations in the early stages of its own outbreak. As the virus has spread, the country has emphasized it would not forget those who had extended a helping hand in its hour of need. Of course, not everything has gone smoothly. The quality of Chinese-produced protective materials and diagnostic kits have come under intense scrutiny abroad, with some countries criticizing it for exporting substandard products. It’s true that, as overseas demand soared, a number of manufacturers took advantage of differences in international quality standards or turned to unqualified certification firms to get their exports approved. This pursuit of short-term profits by a few individual firms has dealt a blow to the reputation of Chinese manufacturers everywhere. In response, the Chinese government issued a notice March 31 requiring exported materials not just to meet the requirements of a given importing country or region, but also obtain certification according to Chinese standards. The COVID-19 pandemic is in many ways unprecedented, and everyone is still searching for effective solutions. Complicating matters, countries that might once have led the global response have instead abdicated their responsibilities. In the resulting vacuum, China’s every action has been put under the microscope in ways the country may not have been prepared for: European media outlets have blasted China for over-hyping its foreign aid, and even sending medical teams to African countries has been characterized by local media as somehow belittling the professional competence of the continent’s doctors. Rather than allow itself to be frustrated by what it perceives as unfair criticisms, China needs to understand and sympathize with dissenting voices in the course of upholding its international responsibilities. And a more low-key approach to publicity might be in order. Historically, China itself has associated receiving aid with weakness, so it should come as no surprise that other countries might feel the same way. Besides, even if China’s earlier success in controlling the coronavirus was facilitated by aid and supplies from abroad, it ultimately came down to its own hard work and sacrifices made by millions of Chinese. The same is true of Italy, South Korea, Germany, and all the other countries that have “flattened the curve,” thanks to the work of their policymakers and residents. There is still a long way to go to before anything like victory against the coronavirus can be declared, and international cooperation will remain vital to global health initiatives for the foreseeable future. China is working hard to show its sincerity and commitment to international cooperation, but assuaging other countries’ doubts will take empathy, understanding, and effective communication.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005687
How Bad Assumptions Derail Epidemic Prevention,"Increased population mobility helped COVID-19 spread across China, but so did outdated and misleading notions about who travels.",2020-05-15,"It’s been less than half a year since the novel coronavirus was first identified. In that short span of time, it’s already reached six continents, infected over 4.4 million people, and contributed to more than 300,000 deaths worldwide as of May 15. It should be clear by now that the rapid development of international transportation networks and the attendant rise in global mobility allow viruses to spread faster and more easily than ever before. In China, the coronavirus was carried to every province-level region in the weeks and days leading up to and just after the Lunar New Year holiday, a time when hundreds of millions of Chinese return home or travel. And the country’s subsequent success in controlling and rolling back its coronavirus-linked COVID-19 epidemic owes much to its strict controls on movement: quarantining suspected carriers, shutting down transit links, developing digital health passports, and putting up cordon sanitaire around the hardest-hit regions, including Wuhan. Now that the country’s outbreak appears to be under control, however, it’s worth reflecting on some of the assumptions driving these decisions. For example, many of the most onerous measures fell squarely on the heads of the country’s “floating population” of migrant workers — a largely blue collar group that takes advantage of the extended holiday to travel home each year. As fear spread, migrants, especially those from Wuhan and the surrounding areas, reported having their private information leaked or being told by their landlords not to return after the holiday. But were blue collar migrants really the main reason for the spread of the virus in China? For many Chinese people, COVID-19 brought back memories of the deadly 2003 SARS outbreak. Yet although the number of internal migrants in China approximately doubled over the past 20 years, tourism- and business-related travel have grown much faster over that same period. For instance, the number of domestic tourists is currently 7.4 times higher than it was in 2000.  Full data for 2020 is not yet available, but statistics from 2019’s Lunar New Year travel rush show there were 367,000 trips in and out of Wuhan each day between Jan. 21 and March 1. This may seem like a lot, but it is only about one-third higher than the overall daily average for 2018. Ordinary business travel declines during the period before and after the Lunar New Year, but this drop is largely canceled out by an increase in tourists. Thus, even when the flow of migrants is at its peak, it is unlikely to account for more than one-third of total movement in and out of Wuhan — and likely less. Meanwhile, a spatial analysis of the epidemic’s spread shows the earliest and most severely affected cities outside of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province were not the region’s primary sources of migrant labor. Rather, they were business hubs like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai, as well as beach cities like Zhuhai and Sanya. Even in the provinces surrounding Hubei, the worst-hit areas were provincial capitals with business and tourism links to Wuhan, not the border regions from which the city draws its migrant labor force. This isn’t to say monitoring migrants in a pandemic is unimportant, but we have to be attuned to some of the shifts that have taken place in migrant populations over the past few decades. China’s migrant population has doubled, but it’s also changed qualitatively, with more migrants engaged in business instead of menial labor. These businesspeople are far more likely to engage in the kind of behaviors that spread infectious disease than migrant factory workers. Arriving at their destination, they have more opportunities for contact with locals through their business activities, wide social networks, and active social lives, putting them at a high risk for infecting people. This is one reason that Wenzhou and Taizhou — two eastern cities known for their go-anywhere business cultures — were among the hardest hit outside of the outbreak’s epicenter, even though there were few there who had returned from Wuhan. In short, many of the actions that most affected migrants over the past few months were based on false assumptions and caused communities and urban officials to lose focus on other potential transmission vectors while unintentionally increasing the fractures between residents from different regions. If anything, such strategies may have led migrants to deliberately conceal their identities and travel histories, making it harder to track and stop the coronavirus’ spread. More important, the epidemic response has exposed key deficiencies in China’s community governance. Part of the problem can be attributed to the longstanding, if mostly one-sided, competition between locals and migrants over urban public services. But top-down management approaches and a lack of awareness also hindered control and prevention work. State-appointed community workers, despite purporting to serve residents, are often more concerned about not angering their bosses or being blamed for problems in their jurisdictions. Even when cities and local residents themselves were not calling for restrictions to be put on migrants, nervous grassroots officials sometimes used their power over communities to unilaterally impose such rules. These problems would be less salient if grassroots governance was open to multi-party participation, with community workers instructed to act as coordinators for local stakeholders or organizers of public affairs rather than as agents of an omnipotent government. Currently, community workers do more to hamper the construction of an inclusive urban society than promote it. China also needs to be more careful in how it uses emerging technologies such as big data, which are becoming prominent parts of the country’s governance toolkit. The data generated by the movement of people played an important role in preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 by allowing officials to trace contacts and isolate them. But as the example of migrants suggests, it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees: mistaking all human movement for migration, or migrants for a homogenous group. Failing to adopt a more cautious approach to technology runs the risk of causing even greater damage in the future. Only when policymakers clearly understand the complexity behind the data — the actual composition of the groups they’re tracking, for example — can they avoid making incorrect judgments and predictions about disease transmission or other important issues. In future epidemic prevention and control work, the country should face up to the complexities posed by its floating population and avoid simple but inefficient prevention and control measures. In the long term, China needs a more inclusive social environment, a more diverse governance system, and a more effective use of new technologies, not just for epidemic prevention but for the good of all society.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005662
Wuhan Opens Psychiatric Clinic for COVID-19 Survivors,"It often takes months for a trauma patient’s mental health symptoms to surface and be recognized, staff say.",2020-05-15,"The first psychiatric clinic for COVID-19 survivors, as well as people facing mental health issues related to the pandemic, opened Thursday in Wuhan, as the central Chinese city attempts to heal the widespread psychological trauma caused by the infectious disease and a monthslong lockdown. For the official launch Thursday, eight people — most of them elderly — visited the outpatient clinic of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University seeking consultations. During the citywide lockdown, volunteer counselors manned online channels and 24-hour hotlines. But people less familiar with technology and the internet have been slower to take advantage of such services. “Previously, many middle-aged and elderly people with psychological needs were not able to seek help through online services,” Gao Yongzhe, the hospital’s deputy chief of neurology, who was on duty at the clinic Thursday, told Sixth Tone. He added that these two demographics represent the majority of all COVID-19 patients in China. The clinic — which will receive visitors semiweekly, on Tuesdays and Thursdays — offers consultations and therapies based on diagnoses of the patients’ psychological issues, according to Gao. While people may be experiencing pain or a range of trauma symptoms, such as stress and depression, it takes extra awareness to see that their discomfort is related to their mental rather than physical state, the doctor said. “Some people aren’t aware of this, and think there must be something wrong with their body,” Gao said. As the inland transit and manufacturing hub has begun to recover after its 76-day lockdown, thousands of COVID-19 survivors have been given the all-clear. However, many continue to deal with feelings of guilt and shame, as well as fears that the disease might return. Those brave enough to resume their lives often feel ostracized by others who view them as potential disease-spreaders. According to a national health guideline published Thursday about the recovery of COVID-19 survivors, psychological dysfunction involves emotional responses, cognitive changes, behavior disorders, and physiological reactions. While a condition like acute stress disorder may be quick to detect, chronic psychological disorders tend to emerge over time, which is why they require extra attention, specialists say. “Take post-traumatic stress disorder,” Gao said. “We may be seeing more cases three months down the road.” Staff at Zhongnan Hospital said that while the psychiatric clinic is specifically aimed at treating COVID-19 survivors, it is also open to the general public if they have COVID-19-related psychological needs. Xiao Jinsong, a senior counselor at the hospital who consulted with both patients and medics during Wuhan’s lockdown, and who now works at the clinic, shared his experience with a recent case: a man who lost a family member to COVID-19 and came to him Thursday for help. “He had sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and the general feeling that life had become meaningless. This was a typical case of psychological trauma,” Xiao, who is also head of the Hubei Psychological Consultant Association, told Sixth Tone. He prescribed the patient medicine and encouraged him to organize fun activities with his family and consider reading novels when he was alone. The COVID-19 pandemic is creating mounting psychological pressure in hard-hit areas, as people are forced to tackle isolation, disease, death, and abrupt changes to their lives. The United Nations has warned of a potential global mental health crisis. In China, nearly 30% of over 25,000 respondents said they suffered from depression and anxiety related to the pandemic, according to a survey released in April.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005654
How to Keep a Public Health Crisis From Becoming a Privacy Nightmare,"Widespread data collection has become a feature of COVID-19 responses around the world, including China. Is there anyway to guarantee its safety?",2020-05-12,"This article is part of an ongoing series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. Last month, a list of over 6,000 current and former patients of a hospital in the eastern city of Jiaozhou surfaced in an online chat group. The leaked details included not just the patients’ names, but their addresses, contact information, state-issued identity card numbers, and other personal information. This wasn’t the first high-profile security breach of private medical information following the heightened countrywide paranoia due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the central province of Hubei. At the peak of the domestic epidemic in late January, Hubei natives living around the country had their personal information published by fearful locals. The global adoption of infectious disease control and management technologies over the past few months has inevitably led to invasions of personal privacy, whether in the form of hardware like tracking wristbands or local governments teaming up with software companies to collect user data. On the Chinese mainland, tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have both unveiled “color code” health passport systems, which harvest data from users’ cellphones and use it to evaluate their potential health risks. Given the ongoing public health crisis, I think it’s reasonable for governments or other relevant institutions to collect and use citizens’ personal information, provided it is done in accordance with laws and is limited in scope. We all know people’s lives are at risk. The high stakes make it easier for users to acquiesce to temporary measures like disclosing some or all of our identifying and behavioral data to the government, hospitals, communities, and relevant public service providers — even if that means also giving it to cooperating private tech companies. But if we’re going to make trade-offs and concessions for the sake of public health, we also need to remember this should not be the norm. It’s hardly a secret there’s almost no such thing as true personal privacy in today’s China. Whether for the sake of convenience or speed, almost all of the data we generate, from our shopping histories to our itineraries, is accessible to internet companies and government agencies. These info points are then compiled into dossiers — known in the industry as “user portraits” — that paint an almost complete picture of our digital lives. Any misuse or leak of this data can have dire consequences. And even if it isn’t misued or leaked illegally, the lack of legal and commercial safeguards in our emerging digital age is leaving us vulnerable to ubiquitous monitoring. Even now, the current paradigm has essentially indentured us to tech companies who harvest, utilize, and sell our personal information for profit. There are ways, even in a pandemic-scale crisis, to guarantee the privacy of individuals. We just need to commit to building new infrastructure capable of safeguarding our fundamental rights. One such technology is known as privacy-preserving computation. In simple terms, it is a means of computation that prioritizes protecting user privacy during the generation, collection, preservation, analysis, utilization, and destruction of data. Unlike on the “traditional” internet, which sends raw data back and forth, in privacy-preserving computation, data is transmitted and processed in a “secret” state. Cloud servers do not have ownership rights, only processing rights. Thus, users’ data cannot be obtained by other parties. Privacy-preserving computation accomplishes this through modern cryptography. If it is adopted more widely, internet companies will have to ask for users’ consent for accessing their valuable social and shopping data. And that means users will have leverage in negotiating for a share of the profits or commercial value generated. For example, instead of the current model, in which companies sell user data, a privacy-centric model would allow users to “lease” their data out — the more it’s used, the more money they get. During exceptional times like the ongoing pandemic, in which the government requires personal information to track users, privacy-preserving computing would allow the public sector access and management rights, but with cryptographic algorithms in place to protect individual privacy. None of this is simple. It requires reshuffling and rebuilding the country’s data processing capabilities, compliance architecture, and other systems. Yet at a time when the greatest security challenge facing humankind may come not from sudden crises, but from the gradual erosion of our privacy and digital security, it’s all the more important to be vigilant.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005634
How COVID-19 Exposed the Little Troubles With China’s Big Data Push,"China has spent a decade investing in big data. But despite some notable successes, the coronavirus showed the industry still isn’t ready for prime time.",2020-05-11,"Over the past decade, China has invested heavily in the emerging field of big data. Massive data centers have been built in remote interior provinces like Guizhou and Gansu, and the national government has outlined plans for a national patient information platform. Officials view these investments as part of a broader program to improve social management, modernize governance, and build a smarter society by leveraging the vast quantities of information generated by our digital society. By 2018, the market for such services was worth an estimated 600 billion yuan ($93 billion). It should come as no surprise that China would try to get the most out of these investments in its battle against COVID-19. The most prominent example has probably been the nation’s various “health code” initiatives, in which local governments partnered with tech giants Alibaba or Tencent to assign residents a risk rating based on their personal information, cellphone geolocation data, and up-to-the minute tracking information on confirmed cases and clusters, among other factors. But big data has also been used by some local governments to provide residents confined to their homes with online services, as well as to allocate and monitor medical supplies and protective gear. Following the initial outbreak, many neighborhoods and medical institutions turned to cloud computing platforms to collect and record information about the source, quantity, and kinds of goods at their disposal, for example. Given the high cost of big data infrastructure, however, it’s worth asking how much the above programs really contributed to the country’s epidemic prevention efforts. The early returns seem underwhelming. Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, had previously positioned itself on the cutting edge of the big data industry. But in the early days of its fight against the coronavirus, the city still found itself reliant on human labor — neighborhood workers, volunteers, and other personnel — to allocate supplies, screen residents, and track patients. One obstacle to actually using big data in meaningful ways is the continued existence of “information islands,” large agglomerations of data not shared across broader networks. Information collection is costly and time-consuming, and there are few incentives for local governments to share their data with each other — or even for their various departments to do so. These islands hamper coordination. For instance, health codes still aren’t recognized across regional lines. Wuhan residents might have a green code issued by their local health authorities, indicating they’re healthy and able to travel freely. But if they journey to other areas, they must go through the verification process again. Technical problems and errors have also played a role. For big data to be used effectively, it must be accurate, and its accuracy hinges on the scope and scale of the data collected. Missing or unavailable data can significantly reduce the accuracy of algorithms and models. Some people who have not been to Hubei for a long time were nevertheless flagged by color code algorithms as having been there in the previous 14 days. Inconsistencies in technical and platform standards also limit big data’s utility while increasing the workload of grassroots level operatives. During the height of China’s epidemic, prevention workers had to collect data and report duplicate information to a multitude of platforms and databases. And then there is the problem of leaks. For big data-reliant tracking and screening programs to function, they need to collect people’s location information, health status, recent activity, and other information. Yet many poorly designed platforms are prone to massive data breaches. After patient and personal data leaked on messaging platform WeChat, people who had once lived in Hubei became the target of abuse and discrimination, even if they hadn’t been back in years. The truth is, for all big data’s seeming accuracy, it offers nothing more than a probability estimate and is subject to errors or bias, just like anything else. If the past few months are any indication, getting the most out of the technology will require significant troubleshooting. First, China needs a national-level system of laws, rules, and safeguards for big data and related technologies. This would embed big data into the national governance system while ensuring ample, detailed system safeguards for its use in specific situations or areas. Second, big data and associated technologies are advancing all the time, but governments and officials often dawdle when it comes to learning, accepting, and operating new technology. Many local government departments sought to provide digital services to constituents over the past few months, but there are still plenty whose websites are all but defunct. To ensure its data resources can be used fully and effectively, governments need to better train their workers and increase the number of those with big data expertise. Finally, the effective use of big data requires high-quality input. We need to reform information systems, break down information barriers between local governments and their agencies, and build standardized information platforms. China’s public security apparatus has access to population and mobility data, while health officials have access to citizen’s medical information. If they had shared that data in a timely fashion, the government could have accurately identified the movements of suspected virus carriers and carried out prevention measures in real time. China has invested heavily in big data, but the COVID-19 pandemic shows us how far we still have to go if those investments are to pay off. Rather than be discouraged by its underwhelming performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, we should focus on fixing the problems the outbreak has exposed.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005617
Chinese City Resumes Lockdown After COVID-19 Cluster Detected,Shulan becomes the latest city in China’s northeast to impose movement restrictions on residents after a dozen people were diagnosed with the coronavirus over the weekend.,2020-05-11,"A city in northeastern China has re-imposed lockdown measures after diagnosing 12 new COVID-19 cases in three days, state-run newspaper People’s Daily reported Monday. Health authorities in Jilin province announced Friday that Shulan, a city of 630,00 people, had identified one confirmed COVID-19 case: a 45-year-old woman. Two days later, the local government reported that 11 more people had tested positive for COVID-19, all of them close contacts of the woman. Following the announcements, Shulan adjusted its coronavirus risk level from low to medium, then medium to high. Residential communities were put under lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, with new measures including closing schools and resuming online classes, as well as prohibiting gatherings such as dinners at restaurants. As of Monday, Shulan is the only “high-risk” city or region in China. Meanwhile, Jilin, the second-largest city in the province of the same name, announced three confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday, all of them linked to the cases in Shulan. Jilin is not the only province to experience a sudden rise in COVID-19 cases recently, even as the novel coronavirus has been largely contained in China. In April, the city of Suifenhe in neighboring Heilongjiang province imposed a lockdown after detecting dozens of new COVID-19 infections among Chinese nationals returning from Russia. Suifenhe lowered its risk level to low and lifted its monthlong lockdown measures last week, after all returnees from abroad were released from compulsory 14-day quarantine periods, according to Xinhua Net. Also on Monday, Wuhan, the central Chinese city where COVID-19 was first detected, reported five new cases, all among residents in the same housing community.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005630
Step by Step: A COVID-19 Patient’s Road to Recovery,"Yang Hong spent two months on and off a ventilator in an ICU. Now, he’s slowly getting back on his feet.",2020-05-09,"This story is part of a visual series highlighting the first-hand experiences of those caught in the crossfires of the coronavirus epidemic in central city Wuhan. HUBEI, Central China — Perched upright in a hospital bed, Yang Hong cradles his smartphone to his ear and makes a seemingly innocuous request of his wife: “Bring me a pair of cloth shoes.” Yang’s feeling encouraged. Just earlier that day in mid-April, the 47-year-old was at last able to stand up for a couple minutes after being bedridden and going on and off a ventilator for the past two months. A physiotherapist supported him from behind, and he was so tired, it was as if he’d run 1 kilometer. But with more physical therapy, he’d be able to walk.   Back in mid-January, Yang, a doctor of nephrology in Changjiang Hospital of Changjiang Water Resources Commission, was diagnosed with the coronavirus after a CT scan showed he had an infection of the lungs. He’d had a cough and fever on Jan. 5. By Jan. 20, just days before the central city of Wuhan was put in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus, he was in the intensive care unit of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital being put on a ventilator for the first time. The hospital’s ICU, designated for treating COVID-19 patients, was overrun with the critically ill. All 10 beds in the ward were occupied until April, with hospital staff working overtime to care for cases with no known effective treatment. Yang proved resilient. Hospital staff tried to take him off the ventilator twice, only for him to have difficulty breathing once more. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy, but medical staff remained optimistic. Yang was the first patient to show improvements in the ICU. “I was so glad to see his will to survive,” resident ICU doctor Chen Yumei says. “This is really important.” Yang’s wife, Huang Min, watched his progress from behind a glass door, leaving fruit and groceries at the ICU for medical workers to deliver to him. Though the time apart has been difficult for the 45-year-old, she says she’s glad her husband is in a safe and clean environment. “I don’t feel our connection has been separated by doors,” Huang says. “I feel it’s more reassuring to see him through a glass door. That means he’s inside a safe and clean place.” Yang was eventually transferred to No. 1 People’s Hospital for recovery. Huang waited for him outside for the transfer to see him face to face, saying she felt “at ease.” From then on, Yang made incremental improvements, extending his toes and moving his fingers to regain muscle strength. When Yang finally placed his two feet on the floor the morning he asked for the shoes, he was exhausted, but exhilarated all the same. “With the physiotherapist’s help and support from behind, I could stand up,” he tells Huang over the phone. “I stood up on my own two feet.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005621
‘Lower Your Expectations’: Graduating in Wuhan Amid COVID-19,The city’s COVID-19 epidemic has receded. But so has the number of job openings.,2020-05-09,"HUBEI, Central China — Zhang Fan’s daily scrolls through the job listings at her university’s career center are starting to feel futile. The college senior hopes to work as a geography teacher after graduating this summer, but there’s a problem: None of the public schools in her home province of Hubei in central China are hiring. “Recruitment probably isn’t the first thing on their minds,” Zhang tells Sixth Tone. Zhang is one of 440,000 final-year undergraduates in Hubei — the center of China’s initial COVID-19 epidemic — who have been attempting to complete their final months of studies amid a public health emergency that has killed thousands in the province. With Hubei’s outbreak now largely under control, life in the region is slowly returning to normal. The provincial capital Wuhan lifted a 76-day lockdown in early April. But students like Zhang are graduating into a future full of uncertainty.  Many have had their plans for post-college life dashed due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Finding a job, meanwhile, has become tougher than ever as companies institute hiring freezes to cope with an unprecedented economic contraction. Zhang is set to graduate from Hubei University of Science and Technology (HBUST) in just over a month, but the 24-year-old still has no idea what she’ll do next. She originally hoped to go to graduate school in the fall. None of the universities to which she applied have responded, however, as they’ve only just reopened after closing in January. Teaching was her backup plan, but even that might not work out, she says. Only a few positions at private schools or tutoring centers are available, and they offer fewer benefits than those at public institutions. “Usually we would’ve known what’s next by now,” says Zhang. “I guess I would take a private school job as my last resort.” Thousands of students in Hubei are in a similar situation. Competition for jobs requiring college education in China was already fierce, as the number of degree-holders has increased rapidly in recent years. An estimated 8.7 million students will graduate this year, up from 5.7 million a decade ago. In a 2019 survey by recruitment platform Zhaopin.com, 88% of graduates said it was difficult to find work. In Hubei, it’s even more intense. The province is one of China’s largest education hubs with over 120 higher education institutions — 30 more than Beijing. During normal times, many graduates find work at the city’s “Optics Valley” and other Wuhan technology hubs. Now, however, new openings on the ground are thin.  Even seniors at Wuhan University, one of China’s top-ranked colleges, are struggling to secure a job this year, according to Liu Wenbin, deputy head of the university’s career center. “During March and April last year, around 60 to 80 of our students were being hired per day,” Liu tells Sixth Tone. “But this year, only about 10 students are getting job offers each day.” Liu says most small, privately owned businesses in Hubei haven’t reopened or have only just done so, and so hiring isn’t a priority. Many employers have also abandoned plans to take on more staff due to the economic uncertainty. “We’ve seen a significant reduction in demand (for talent) from companies,” says Liu. “But luckily, government policies are helping.” Central and provincial authorities are rolling out measures designed to shore up the job market. In March, China’s official unemployment rate dipped slightly to 5.9%, but many analysts say the figure fails to capture the true scale of joblessness, especially as migrant workers aren’t included in official surveys. In Hubei, small firms that hire graduates will be given special stipends. The Ministry of Education, meanwhile, launched a “24365 campus hiring service” in late February, partnering with recruitment websites including 51job to support the class of 2020.  But connecting students with employers — especially smaller businesses — has been a challenge amid continued restrictions on large gatherings. The coronavirus struck during the spring term, usually the peak time for graduate recruitment in China. Hundreds of mostly local companies would normally attend careers fairs on campuses across Hubei during this period, but the events were all canceled. Universities have launched online portals to help seniors share resumes with companies and set up video interviews. Smaller firms, however, are still adapting to the new system, says Mei Xianchen, deputy head of the career center at HBUST, Zhang’s school. “Some smaller firms don’t have specialized human resources departments, so they don’t have the capacity to deal with online hiring,” says Mei. “But these local companies are usually the major source of jobs for our students.”  According to Mei, only 30% of HBUST’s class of 2020 have secured job offers to date, compared with at least 60% this time last year. “The situation is bad,” he says. Students are also struggling with virtual job hunting, with some unable to navigate the system and send out resumes, according to Mei. Zhang is particularly fed up with the online interview process. “Video interviews are frustrating,” she says. “I can’t present some of my skills, like writing clearly on the blackboard, which would’ve earned me some points.” But the employment market in Hubei is likely to improve later in the year, provided the province can avoid a second virus outbreak, experts tell Sixth Tone. 51job is running a job platform for graduates from Hubei in partnership with the Ministry of Education. Zhang Qihao, a human resources expert from the company, says although the number of positions listed for Hubei on 51job’s platforms is only around 70%-80% of the level seen this time last year, the firm expects to see an improvement during the second and third quarters. “There’s usually a three-to-six-month lag between the recovery of the economy and the job market,” says Zhang. “Since late March, we’ve already seen a dramatic rise in the number of job listings and people posting resumes.” Wuhan in particular has shown clear signs of improvement since the city’s lockdown ended April 8, according to Zhang. As of April 20, there were 88,000 Wuhan-based job openings on 51job’s website, up 166% compared with a month earlier.  Frank Long, an economic sociologist at Wuhan University, predicts that China’s economy will stabilize by next January. “The economy and job market won’t get worse than it was earlier this year, when Hubei ground to a halt for two months,” says Long. “Even if we were hit by a second wave in November as some assume, it wouldn’t be as bad as before. We’ll be prepared and know what to do.” Although the services sector — especially restaurants and travel businesses — has been battered by the lockdown, Long expects the crisis might also create opportunities for some graduates in technical fields. “The epidemic has revealed the dire need to fund and develop our public health sector, as well as other technology-intensive industries like big data analysis,” he says. For now, Hubei’s universities are simply trying to soothe students’ anxieties. Liu at Wuhan University says the career office has been receiving a large number of calls from final-year undergrads unsure where to go next.  “We told them to be patient and confident,” says Liu. “We’re one of the top schools in the country. Finding a job shouldn’t be a problem for our students — as long as they have fair expectations.” According to Liu, today’s graduates have increasingly high requirements for their first jobs, which sometimes prevent them from actually starting their careers. “They want their first job to be their dream job.” Mei at HBUST says he’s giving his students the same message. He’s encouraging graduates to consider less fashionable jobs — such as positions in local residential committees, small businesses, or in smaller cities. “We guide them to correctly assess the situation,” says Mei. Liu’s biggest worry for Wuhan graduates, however, isn’t the state of the economy: It’s the discrimination they may face from people elsewhere in China, where the virus didn’t strike so hard. “They may run into trouble finding an apartment, and employers may turn them down simply because they come from Hubei,” says Liu. “Labeling people is just not necessary.”  Correction: The article has been updated to correct the job title of Frank Long.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005618
Trust in Science Saved China. Practicing It Will Keep It Safe,The secret to the country’s success against COVID-19 is simple: It listened to the experts.,2020-05-08,"I’m part of what’s known in China as the “reform and opening-up” generation. Born between the late 1970s and early 1980s, just after the Cultural Revolution and decades of antagonism with the Western world, we grew up worshipping the United States. Many of my peers spent their college years preparing for the TOEFL or GRE exams in the hopes of going stateside for school. From there they planned to find a job and settle down in the most economically, technologically, and politically advanced country in the world. In short, the U.S. for us has always seemed like a beacon of inspiration. So you can imagine what it’s been like to watch the flailing American response to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past three months. The U.S. hasn’t just performed worse than any other developed country: Even by its own “exceptional” standards, its performance defies belief. The country has more than 70,000 dead and 1 million confirmed cases — and that’s not considering the chronic testing issues making it impossible to ascertain the true scope of the country’s outbreak. It’s numbing. I understand partisanship has turned the coronavirus into a political issue, annoying as that is. I even understand why some American politicians and media outlets have chosen to scapegoat China to save their political skins. But what I can’t understand is the utter lack of respect for scientific and intellectual expertise at all echelons of American society, whether it’s President Donald Trump’s suggestions that COVID-19 patients be given flu shots and have disinfectant injected into their lungs, or mask-less protestors chanting slogans like “Arrest Bill Gates” and “Fire Fauci,” a reference to one of the U.S. government’s leading scientists. China’s successful efforts in containing its COVID-19 outbreak have given rise to endless theorizing over the past few months. One common argument is that the country benefitted from a supposedly collectivist culture, in which people easily accept and practice rigid discipline. But this overlooks an important and far more modern explanation: People in China, even those who might not personally have the strongest grasp of the underlying science, are generally willing to abide by experts’ advice. Since the evening of Jan. 20, when prominent pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan publicly confirmed on Chinese state television the virus could be spread from person to person, doctors and scientists have taken a leading role in China’s fight against the coronavirus. People turn to them — and not politicians or TV hosts — for the latest updates and epidemic prevention news. In addition to Zhong, Dr. Zhang Wenhong, director of the Center for Infectious Disease at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, has become a national idol thanks to his grounded and humorous style of speaking. This faith in science and expertise is not some immutable Oriental truth, but the product of a painful and protracted process of modernization. The First Opium War in the mid-19th century shattered the blind arrogance of imperial China, forcing the country — albeit belatedly — to come to grips with its weaknesses in the face of sophisticated Western weaponry and technology. What followed was a century of life-and-death crises in which Chinese learned to associate falling behind with harsh beatings. Only by mastering science could the country protect itself. The process began with the late-Qing dynasty scholar Wei Yuan, who famously proposed that “learning the ways of the (Western) barbarians” was the only path to resisting them. It continued through the late 19th century “self-strengthening movement” and Mao Zedong’s mid-20th century declaration that China needed to learn from the advanced sciences and technologies of capitalist countries. And to an extent it culminated in Deng Xiaoping’s famous remarks that “science and technology are the primary productive forces” — an idea that helped birth my generation. Nor is China’s passion for science merely a matter of political platitudes: These ideas are deeply popular in the country. Of course, as with anything, acceptance isn’t universal, and sometimes political preferences clash with scientific sense. Just last month, Zhang, the Shanghai doctor, drew fire for recommending children consume more milk and eggs for breakfast. Chinese have been eating porridge for breakfast for millennia, his critics retorted. Who was he to recommend otherwise by pandering to Western dietary fads? Luckily, these nationalist rants were quickly quashed by a tidal wave of refutations and ridicule. More worryingly, however: The unique circumstances under which China adopted scientific values and methods mean many in the country continue to have a limited view of the field’s potential. China’s embrace of science stems from utilitarian motivations, with an emphasis more on national power and prosperity-seeking technological advancement than the spirit of scientific inquiry. This was true in the 1950s and 1960s, when gains in rocketry and nuclear weapons were trumpeted as patriotic triumphs at a time when most intellectuals were social pariahs; and it is true today, when high-profile “new infrastructure” projects such as 5G towers, big data centers, and artificial intelligence applications take precedence over important but unglamorous basic research. The country’s focus on leveraging technology to increase its own wealth and power is at odds with science’s broader aims of understanding our world in ways that involve — and benefit — all. Veneration for the symbols of modernity and scientific advancement is a poor substitute for true scientific inquiry, which is predicated not on unfailing loyalty to an idea but on a willingness to doubt everything and desire to separate truth from lies. Therein lies the paradox. Over the past few months, the United States appears to have fallen prey to the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive bias in which incapable people tend to overestimate their own abilities. China hasn’t had that luxury since the humiliations of the 19th century, but that doesn’t mean it’s permanently safe. As a country, we need to focus on nurturing people’s sense of curiosity, inquisitiveness, and creativity in ways that allow them to practice science, rather than simply respect it. Otherwise, our developments might only ever be limited to technological advancements, and not real scientific breakthroughs.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005613
"After Multiple Deaths, Officials Call for No Masks in Gym Class","Though it’s unclear whether masks played a part in three students dying while exercising at school, some education authorities aren’t taking any chances.",2020-05-08,"Editor’s note: Face masks are scientifically proven to reduce the risk of transmitting and contracting COVID-19, as well as other airborne illnesses, and this article should not be interpreted as evidence to the contrary. See the World Health Organization’s guidelines for how and when to use masks here. Several education bureaus in China are rethinking COVID-19 control policies after three students died running in masks at school, The Beijing News reported Friday. Bureaus in the eastern city of Xiamen, the southern province of Hainan, and the central city of Changsha have issued notices that either discourage schools from requiring students to wear masks during gym class or prohibit the facial accessories during exercise outright. “In light of the recent sudden deaths of students due to running in masks … students should stay at least 1 meter apart and not wear masks during PE class,” Hainan’s education bureau said. In late April, just after many schools across China reopened following months of closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a student from a middle school in Zhoukou, a city in the central Henan province, died after running in PE class while wearing a mask. “The death certificate issued by the hospital said ‘sudden death,’” Li Jian, the father of the deceased child, told domestic publication Health Times. “I still didn’t understand the cause of the sudden death, but I suspected it was from running in a mask. … It was sunny that afternoon, the temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius. How could it be comfortable to run in a mask?” The same month, two more students died under similar circumstances in the cities of Wenzhou and Changsha. While some experts have said running in a mask might lead to difficulty breathing, others have said the sudden deaths may stem from heart problems or other causes. Wu Huanyu, director of the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that students do not have to wear masks while exercising, as long as they’re at a safe distance from their peers and in an environment with good air circulation. During the peak months of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, children across the country were isolated in their homes and studying online. According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of over 3,000 respondents in China said they gained weight because of the change to a more sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic. To help students get back into shape, a middle school in the eastern Jiangsu province has started requiring students to run for at least 100 minutes per day. Meanwhile, parents worried about how the months spent indoors will affect their children’s performance on a national physical fitness exam for rising high schoolers have called on education authorities to cancel this year’s test. As of Friday, at least five education departments at the local and provincial levels have said they will cancel either the whole exam or its long-distance running component.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005609
The Airfare Scandal Rocking China’s Travel Industry,Brick-and-mortar travel agents played a major role in China’s flight-booking market. Then they landed in a dispute over sky-high air ticket prices amid COVID-19.,2020-05-07,"SHANGHAI — In late April, travel agent Fang Si met her business partner Cai Hao for a crisis meeting. The first item on the agenda: trying to save their company by investing in pig farms. Pivoting from luxury flights to livestock is a desperate move, but Fang and Cai feel they have few other options. Their agency is losing money fast and will soon have to fold unless they can find new sources of income. “There’s always a need for pork,” Cai tells Sixth Tone. “We’re not aiming to make big money from such an investment, but we hope the returns can help us cover our basic costs, including the wages of our 12 employees.” Cai and Fang are among the thousands of brick-and-mortar travel agents who have seen their businesses flatline since April, when the industry became embroiled in the febrile politics of the coronavirus pandemic.  Despite the rise of online travel firms, traditional agents still play a major role in China’s flight-booking market. As of 2019, 4,378 agencies focusing on air tickets altogether handled 60% of passenger flight seat reservations, sources at the China Air Transport Association told Chongqing Economic Times. The agency run by Cai and Fang is one such business. Founded in 2004, the Shanghai-based firm has survived by helping companies arrange international business trips, with their profits coming from the service fees charged to clients. But this business model suddenly became untenable after travel agents were accused of charging Chinese citizens sky-high prices for flights back home as they tried to flee European capitals. The first signs of trouble for agents emerged in early March. China’s COVID-19 epidemic had largely subsided, but the country was wary of a second wave of infections beginning as people returned to China from Europe, the United States, and other areas seeing a rapid virus spread. To contain the number of imported cases, Chinese authorities announced that from March 29 domestic airlines would have to drastically cut international flights to China. Each airline would only be allowed to operate one route per country, one flight per week for each route. Seat occupancy rates would be capped at 75%. With thousands of Chinese citizens desperate to return home and escape the growing crisis in the West, the policy appeared certain to trigger a rush to secure seats on the few remaining flights. “Many overseas students were rushing to book flights to return home,” says Fang, whose business concentrates on connections between Shanghai and London.  Airfares soon skyrocketed. By early April, travelers were being quoted prices of 86,900 yuan ($12,250) for a one-way, first-class ticket from London to Shanghai for May 4, according to Securities Daily. Economy-class tickets on other flights leaving Europe were priced as high as 100,000 yuan. With public anger mounting, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) blamed the spike in prices on rogue agents, banning all domestic airlines from collaborating with agents when selling tickets for international flights April 16. “We’d noticed that given the market demand had far surpassed supply, individual agents from home and abroad had hiked the ticket prices to over 100,000 yuan through malpractices like booking seats using false customer information and then changing them to real passengers’ names,” said Sun Shaohua, a CAAC official, in an April 20 press conference. “Airlines should sell all international flight tickets through their direct sales channels and strictly abide by pricing policies … Ticket scalping behavior should be fully banned.” The policy may have helped bring prices down, but it has had a devastating impact on agents. Fang and Cai have been left unable to generate significant revenues but are still paying around 130,000 yuan per month in rent, property management fees, and staff salaries. Most companies in the industry are in similar dire straits, according to Fang. “If we can’t survive, most (players) in this business won’t be able to pull through, either,” says Fang. “We’re still allowed to sell tickets for domestic flights. But 90% of our profits came from international flight tickets.”  For Cai and Fang, the entire industry has been punished for the actions of a few bad actors. They point out that agents had been banned from hiking flight ticket prices under rules introduced about a month before the scandal erupted. “We were banned in late March from raising prices above the rates offered to us by the airlines,” says Fang. “We’d face punishment from a fine to the revoking of our agency certification.” The agents also feel their industry has been unfairly singled out. According to Fang, airlines should also be held accountable for their roles in raising prices. On eTerm — China’s official flight ticket information platform used by airlines and licensed agents — Fang shows Sixth Tone the price of an economy-class ticket from London to Shanghai rising from just over 18,000 yuan in January to 28,825 yuan in late March.  “It (the increase) was purely due to the airline’s pricing,” says Fang. “How could they hike the price, and how did they price their tickets? This has never been made transparent.” The CAAC has been gradually handing domestic airlines more autonomy to set airfares since 2010. In 2016, the airlines were allowed to set their own prices for all flights. For Fang, the authorities’ decision to blame agents for problems during the pandemic reflects a long-term policy trend that has favored larger players in the travel industry at the expense of agencies. “We’ve always been a disadvantaged group,” says Fang. “There’s no industry association to represent us, helping to make our voices heard.” Agencies have been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, according to Cai. Since 2015, when China’s domestic airlines stopped paying agents commissions on flight ticket sales, agencies have made money by charging a 3% service fee for each booking — a rate corporate clients were willing to pay. But the service fees became controversial in March. Authorities deemed the charges a form of price hiking and banned agencies from imposing them. According to Cai, at least one agency was fined for charging a service fee. “Our staff worked lengthy hours to search in the eTerm system for available flight seats,” says Cai. “It doesn’t make sense if we don’t get paid for our services.”  Airlines, meanwhile, have often declined to offer cash refunds for flights canceled during the pandemic, which has put agencies under added financial pressure. Fang says her company has refunded tickets worth 7 million yuan since January. “Some airlines have refunded people with coupons valid for one year due to their capital turnover issues,” says Fang. “But we still have to refund our clients in cash. ... It’s a big pressure on our cash flow.” Cai says he understands why the traditional travel agency industry has declined since he set up the company nearly two decades ago. In the early days, few Chinese consumers had access to the internet, and new online competitors like Ctrip — now rebranded as Trip.com — were barely a threat. Airlines and travelers almost completely relied on agencies to handle flight bookings, with traditional agents making over 90% of seat reservations in 2003. Cai was working at a booth in a hotel near Shanghai Railway Station. “We didn’t need to walk out of the hotel to find customers,” he says. “The customers found you.”  Over time, the big technology companies were able to lure individual travelers with better deals and more convenience. But Fang says agencies still have a lot to offer corporate clients due to the high level of service they provide. Until the pandemic struck, Cai and Fang served nearly 50 companies. “We’re reachable to our clients around the clock,” says Fang. “Working 12 hours a day is normal for us.” It’s still unclear how long Chinese authorities plan to enforce the agency ban. Legal experts tell Sixth Tone the decision to punish an entire class of businesses could go against Chinese competition laws. In 2016, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, announced plans to establish a fair competition review system, to prevent the issuance of policies that might eliminate or limit market competition. The system is now in force across the country.  “Without the pandemic, such a rule (the agency ban) wouldn’t pass the fair competition review,” says Liu Chunquan, a partner at Shanghai-based law firm Duan & Duan who specializes in aviation law. “However, it’s an interim measure to address the problem of skyrocketing air ticket prices in a special time.” For Liu, agencies are within their rights to apply for a review. “It’s definitely a well-intentioned policy,” he says. “But whether it’s scientific to ban all agencies from the business and whether there’s a better way to address the problem, this can be discussed.” The likely outcome of such a lawsuit is unclear. Chinese aviation law doesn’t specify rules on practices by agencies. The fair competition review system, meanwhile, doesn’t state the amount of compensation entitled to businesses with interrupted access to a fair market. Cai and Fang also think agencies have legal grounds for complaint. For now, however, they’re still weighing their options — and making plans for their pig farms.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005602
The Many Faces of Wuhan,Portraits of life after COVID-19.,2020-05-06,"When I first saw Guo, the 61-year-old was hunched over on her hospital bed, head down, knees tucked into her body. As I moved through her ward, one of the “red zones” in the central city of Wuhan for treating serious COVID-19 patients, I heard her try to stifle a cough, then lose control in a fit of hacking and wheezing.  It was a brief glimpse into one of the realities of the city’s recovery. More than 50,000 people were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan; over 3,000 residents died.  Guo herself spent weeks on a ventilator in February. Her husband, who had watched over her before she could be admitted to a hospital, was also infected. His symptoms were a bit milder than Guo’s, but the former soldier was able to convince the ward’s doctors to hospitalize them together so he could continue to take care of her. Twice Guo inadvertently removed her breathing tube late at night: Each time her gasps for air jolted her husband awake, and he was able to get a doctor to reinsert it before she suffocated.  I came late to Wuhan, arriving only a week before the city lifted its 76-day lockdown on April 8. By then, the worst of the city’s outbreak was over, and I spent the first few days of my reporting trip focused on how residents were piecing their lives back together.  But if much of the city is trying to move on, my visit to the red zone was a reminder that not every fight is finished. Before I left the hospital, Guo wrote her phone number on a piece of paper to give to me. When I called 20 days later, her husband answered. He told me Guo had been transferred to a quarantine center on April 23, where she would undergo 14 days of medical observation before finally being released and reunited with her family.  If all goes well, that should happen Thursday. Yet she still hasn’t told her relatives and friends about her hospitalization and worries about their reactions when they find out.  Guo is just one of many Wuhan residents I photographed, and hers is just one of many stories I heard. As much as I want to say I’ll always remember the people I met in the 17 days I spent in Wuhan, already I can feel their faces blending together and fading from my memory. I hope Guo and everyone else can reclaim some sense of normalcy soon, but I also hope moving on doesn’t mean forgetting.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005598
"From the Front Lines: A Steep Learning Curve, a Bittersweet End","For four months, Dr. He Ping supervised a COVID-19 quarantine ward in Wuhan.",2020-05-05,"HUBEI, Central China — Before the coronavirus outbreak had Wuhan firmly in its grasp, Dr. He Ping had never seen an infectious disease up close. The 46-year-old geriatrician had studied cardiovascular disease at Wuhan’s Tongji Medical College, one of the top medical schools in China, from her bachelor’s degree right up to her M.D. When SARS swept across parts of the country in 2002, she was still in graduate school, and Wuhan saw few cases. In the years that followed, as China upgraded its infectious disease response system, the capital of Hubei province — with nearly 400 hospitals, 40,000 licensed doctors, and 54,500 registered nurses — was hailed as a beacon of public health excellence. Then came COVID-19, and the floodgates opened. From opening the first coronavirus-only ward among non-respiratory departments in her hospital to grappling with a disease then only classified as an “unknown pneumonia,” Dr. He, like Wuhan itself, was put to the test like never before. And gradually, she went from working as an internal medicine doctor to leading a COVID-19 ward at ground zero in a four-month battle against the city’s biggest public health emergency. When Sixth Tone visited Dr. He at Wuhan Union Hospital on April 11, just 25 COVID-19 patients were left in her ward. On April 25, the last patient was discharged. Wuhan recorded zero hospitalized coronavirus patients on April 26. This is her story, as told to Sixth Tone and edited for brevity and clarity. On Jan. 2, I was transferred from the headquarters of Wuhan Union Hospital to its branch in Caidian District, to take over the geriatric department. The outbreak was already very serious. We received three COVID-19 patients on Jan. 6 — back then it was still called an unknown pneumonia. Each day, at least three or four patients came in with similar symptoms.  None of us knew anything about the mysterious disease, but when you saw the lung scans of these patients, you knew it was vicious. We knew it was unusual and reported it to the infection control department. We weren’t a designated COVID-19 hospital at that time. After epidemiological inspection and nucleic acid tests, confirmed patients were transferred to Jinyintan Hospital, which specifically dealt with infectious diseases. This meant a lot of effort because Jinyintan Hospital was pretty overstretched, just like we were. There were no beds available, but we managed to transfer the patients. As more flooded in, however, there was simply no way to transfer them all. On Jan. 26, we also became a designated hospital for treating coronavirus patients. All our wards were to be converted into isolation zones. I was tasked with overseeing the conversion of the geriatric ward. According to the list I was given, I was to work with doctors from a variety of disciplines, and only two specialized in internal medicine. It was very stressful at first. The disease was completely new, and the knowledge we had at the time wasn’t enough to meet the challenge around the corner. To my relief, help came the next day. The Beijing medical team — our first assistance team — arrived in Wuhan on the night of Jan. 27 and came to check our ward the next day. As soon as they saw it, they told us it wouldn’t work, that the level of protection was insufficient. Their experts dealt with the SARS outbreak, so they were very experienced. They told us that the existing quarantine area didn’t have the space needed for medics exiting the hot zone to safely take off their protective suits and prevent potentially lethal aerosol transmission. We started work to excavate the wall to create the space needed. The digging was done at 10.30 p.m. The next morning, shortly after clearing the construction debris, we opened our ward. We received 19 patients the first day and in three days my wards were filled. On Jan.30, another floor in our building also opened for coronavirus patients, and around Feb. 5, all 16 floors in the building were converted to specifically treat this disease.  Earlier, many acquaintances had asked us to let their friends in since there was a shortage of beds. People were just calling anyone they knew for help. But our hospital followed norms set by the outbreak command center, and we were issued a list of patients so admissions wouldn’t become chaotic. After more wards opened, and particularly after the introduction of fangcang (temporary shelter hospitals set up in Wuhan to ease the burden on dedicated hospitals) the situation began to look up. Our understanding of this disease was step by step. Initially, we only knew its clinical attributes: cough, sputum, and a fever that did not subside. In acute cases, we saw respiratory distress followed by multiple organ failure. Then there were the lungs, and the images of ground-glass opacity and the change of exudates (which shows white patches in the lungs caused by the build-up of fluid). After seeing several such scans, you will never forget them. They’re that severe. The virus spreads to both lungs, and some just turned completely white (which signals that the air sacs have become increasingly clogged as the lungs filled with fluid). The disease develops rapidly. Many of our patients were fine in the first week but slumped sharply in the second week after multiple organ failure. Some patients who spoke to us in the morning died during our next shift. This was the hardest part. You couldn’t help but think, how could this be? Doctors may witness life and death more than other professions, but in general, we can predict the outcome. But this disease made life and death so abrupt. In our ward, there were many couples, mothers, and children. Many were left alone in the end. This disease is very severe, I hope we never face it again in the future. I had never treated infectious patients before, so everything had to be learned from scratch. When we received orders to become a designated hospital on Jan. 27, the management told us that everyone had to put aside their specialties and become an infectious disease doctor. I pored over medical journals and websites daily. From the beginning, I maintained a diagnosis and treatment plan for our ward, and it was constantly updated. Every day, as long as we learned something new, I updated the plan to include information like malnutrition, thrombosis, DIC, damage the virus caused to the heart as well as treating diabetes, hypertension, etc. We tried to learn as fast as possible. Many doctors from the assistance team specialized in infectious and respiratory diseases. But they didn’t understand our local dialects, so it was hard for them to communicate with the patients. They also needed time to get used to our computer systems, so we dispatched two doctors at a time to help them enter and exit the hot zone. There were many experts on the assistance team. One team led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan (China’s top expert on respiratory diseases) took over one of our ICUs. Every time I participated in a case discussion, it felt particularly rewarding. The whole national team was here. It felt a bit like one of those duels on Mount Hua in the martial arts novels. Over one-third of the patients in my ward were older people. They generally had preexisting health conditions that were tricky to treat, and some developed bacterial complications along with the viral infection. Many of the last remaining patients in my ward were once on the brink of death. They were anxious, and several saw their loved ones succumb to the disease. A grandfather in my ward said that seven of 10 people in his family were infected after one dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve. His wife passed away in our ICU. The grandfather couldn’t call his wife, and he asked us repeatedly of her whereabouts. Our doctor had to lie because if we told him the truth, he might’ve lost the will to live. It was only after he was discharged that his son told him. But he knew it already — he just didn’t want to face it. I hope society won’t be prejudiced against those who have recovered. It’s really not easy for them to carry on. Just surviving is hard. Many were family cluster infections. It’s very common to lose relatives, and they’re living with a very painful experience that’s hard to move on from. Please don’t discriminate against them. Overall, we treated 168 patients. In the first week, five died. But after learning from our experiences, only two passed away in my ward. In the end, it was a good result, and I’m proud of the turnout. Our hospital treated severely ill COVID-19 patients, and the bodies of many had turned purple (indicating a lack of oxygen in their blood) when they were transferred to us. Speaking of the complexity of the treatment, the patient in bed No. 62 was relatively complicated. He experienced a sharp turnaround and went back to the ICU to be intubated. It did him good but when he returned to our ward, he developed a multidrug-resistant bacterial infection, and then pleural effusion (fluid in the lungs). We also set up a special rehabilitation squad to help patients like him function on their own. He finally recovered on April 21. Another patient was readmitted after testing positive again, and he was transferred to our ward. There may have been problems with sampling or transport. The false negative rate of the nucleic acid test could be pretty high. I think he didn’t necessarily test positive again, but was probably positive the whole time.  Patients discharged from our ward have never tested positive again because our discharge criteria are even stricter than the national standard. It takes at least four negative nucleic acid tests for them to be discharged, and there are long intervals between each test. For many patients, the recovery process through nucleic acid tests is: double positive, then single positive, and finally double negative. The national guidelines require obvious absorption in the lungs (indicating reduced scarring), but how do we define “obvious”? Is it 80% absorption? Is it 50%? Or just 30%? This was hard to pin down — we had to understand it ourselves. It’s possible that the virus may exist for a long time, or even appear again. In our country, it is often the elderly who develop severe symptoms, while the young show milder symptoms. But in the United States, some people in their 20s, after one visit to a doctor, die the next day. Some reports indicate that it might be the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect: The patient already had antibodies from an earlier infection, but in the second round, the virus mutated, triggering a stronger response from the immune system. I’m a little worried about this possibility now, and we sometimes discuss it in our WeChat groups. In Wuhan, there may be people who are infected and asymptomatic, but I think this group probably isn’t too large. Gradually, all the medical assistance teams left, leaving only our own doctors to treat the remaining critically ill patients. The surviving patients were basically all difficult cases. Over the last few weeks, we discharged one or two patients a day. They were then transferred to rehabilitation hospitals. At the moment, there are around eight patients being treated in our ICU wards. They have all been cleared of the virus, but we are still on standby in case of positive antibody tests or false negatives. I had mixed feelings yesterday (April 28). I’d been looking forward to the day it would all “end” for a long time, and had prepared myself psychologically — because as patients were discharged, there would come a day when none would be left. But when the wards were finally empty, the feeling was more complicated. It wasn’t just pure joy, as I had expected. Yesterday, when those of us at the hospital sang a song about spring blossoms in memory of this moment, the tears flowed freely. Thinking of what we have been through these past four months, the memories are all bittersweet. Contributions: Ye Ruolin  in Wuhan, Hubei province, April 11, 2020.

How AI Is Speeding Up the Search for a COVID-19 Cure,An artificial intelligence expert explains how the much-hyped technology is being used to identify promising drug molecules.,2020-05-04,"This article is part of an ongoing series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. On Feb. 4, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced perhaps the first government initiative in history to apply artificial intelligence to an epidemic. The proposal called on the country to, among other things, “fully explore the application scenarios of AI in the diagnosis, treatment, and containment of COVID-19.” From viral analysis and AI-aided diagnostics to scanning crowds for signs of fever, China has utilized artificial intelligence on a large scale over the past four months. But AI’s most promising application yet may be in the field of pharmaceutical research, where it’s fueling studies into new drugs for COVID-19 while also helping researchers check if any existing medications could be repurposed for the fight. My company has been using computational methods to understand the virus and search for potential cures since Jan. 20, the day the new coronavirus’ genetic sequence was released to the public. Thus far, the industry has focused most of its efforts on checking existing anti-viral medications for their potential effectiveness against COVID-19. Compared with starting drug development from scratch, finding new uses for existing drugs offers a potential shortcut to effective treatment, in part because the selected drugs have already undergone rounds of rigorous testing and clinical trials to establish their safety and side effects. Using our AI-powered drug research and development platform, our team screened for possible mutations in the virus. We then screened more than 2,900 Food and Drug Administration-approved drug molecules and over 10,000 traditional Chinese medicine molecules for candidates that could potentially inhibit three of the protein subunits the virus uses to transcribe itself on host cells and replicate. Using high-accuracy computational chemistry algorithms, on Feb. 2 we narrowed our list down to the 38 most promising candidates. We are currently collaborating with pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to test their efficacy in experiments. The repurposing of existing drugs for use in treating COVID-19 is not without limitations. Because they were not specifically designed to target the new coronavirus, they are likely to be less efficient, meaning they might require higher dosages to be effective and consequently cause stronger side effects. Some of the most initially promising repurposed drug candidates were an AIDS cocktail consisting of lopinavir and ritonavir, Ebola treatment candidate remdesivir, and the anti-malarial drug chloroquine. All of them have suffered setbacks in recent clinical trials, however, as researchers seek to ascertain their efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients. There are seven strains of coronavirus known to cause mild to potentially life-threatening diseases in humans, including COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Unfortunately, previous attempts to develop drugs and vaccines for SARS and MERS fizzled out, because the epidemics subsided before drug development was complete, making it impossible to recruit enough patients to complete the necessary clinical trials. If we don’t want to keep repeating this cycle, we need to design and develop broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs capable of fending off any future mutations. The process of developing a new drug is long. Researchers first need to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to an infection or disease, then they must identify and design drug molecules that can effectively bind to proteins in the virus or in the body, preventing the virus from replicating itself. After that, through a series of experiments of increasing complexity — first on a biochemical and cellular level, then on animals — researchers carry out tests into these molecules’ antiviral activity and safety. Finally, promising drugs are tested in a clinical setting to verify their overall efficacy in humans. Chemists posit that there at least 10^60 potential molecules with drug-like properties that could one day be tapped for pharmaceutical research. Currently, we have access to up to 10^23 of these for drug discovery and research. Trying to find new molecules with certain properties and effects on a given target in such a vast field is a gargantuan task, but the powerful computing capabilities offered by AI can help us significantly broaden our search for potential cures while speeding up the process. The advantage of applying AI in drug discovery is not limited to its computing power. AI algorithms also have a strong ability to learn iteratively. We can teach an AI the “language” of biology and chemistry, then use it to discover laws and patterns that are beyond human powers of perception or comprehension. An AI model can generate a massive amount of molecules or amino acid sequences, then design new sets of molecules based on experimental or computational feedback. Relying on the interaction between AI and human experts, we can select a small group of the most promising candidates and subject them to further experimental testing. In our own drug screening efforts, we’ve chosen to focus on the coronavirus’ spike protein — which plays a crucial role in infecting human cells — as well as a few other key protein subunits that are widely considered attractive drug targets. We hope to identify molecules that are effective in treating COVID-19: ones whose efficacy, toxicity, and key physicochemical properties make them more likely to succeed. We’re also exploring biomolecules, which are formed by sequences of amino acids. Pharmaceutical research and development is a complex, long-term, and high-risk undertaking that demands sophisticated technology and considerable investment. Traditional pharmaceutical R&D takes, on average, more than 10 years to create a drug from start to finish and can cost upward of $1 billion. For every 5,000 to 10,000 molecules that enter the R&D pipeline, only one will become a marketable drug. Much of that time is spent in clinical trials, but by combining AI with other cutting-edge computer technologies and experimental techniques, we hope to shorten the early-stage drug discovery process from three to four years to just one year. The global research community is in a race to find effective therapies for COVID-19, but thanks to the development and application of AI and other algorithm-driven technologies, we are hoping to see more good news regarding the advancement of drug and vaccine development over the next three to six months. It’s possible many of these projects will fail or not be completed in time, but the insights we accumulate and the new technologies we develop will empower pharmaceutical innovation and hasten our response in the future.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005566
Grief in a Fallen City: On Processing the Trauma of COVID-19,"COVID-19 killed over 3,800 people in Wuhan. A local grief counselor discusses what it’s like to help the survivors pick up the pieces.",2020-05-01,"This article is the last in a series of first-person accounts from medical workers who lived and worked in Wuhan over the past four months. The rest of the series can be found here. Late one night in March, a young woman I was counseling suddenly sent me a message. “Can I put your name down as my emergency contact?” The woman had just lost her mother to COVID-19. Her father had been out of the picture since she was a child. She was essentially an orphan. I said yes. After a slight pause, she messaged again: “When my mother was alive, she was always my emergency contact. Now that she’s gone, I have no one to put down on the form. If I die, no one in this world would care or miss me.” She’s not the only person who lost their emergency contact to the coronavirus. I’ve worked in a Wuhan hospital’s hospice care center since 2007, but the past four months were like nothing I’ve ever seen. Here, at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than 50,000 people fell sick. Over 3,800 died. The city’s initial battle against the coronavirus appears to be drawing to a close — the city announced it had cleared its last hospitalized COVID-19 patients of the virus on April 26 and the streets are gradually returning to life — but the psychological scars will take far longer to heal.  No Time to Say Goodbye In early February, a university professor who’d organized a team of social workers and psychological counselors to provide counseling services asked me if I would be interested in joining. Figuring I could use my expertise in grief counseling to help patients and their families, I agreed. Over the past 13 years, I’ve met countless terminal cancer patients and their loved ones, watching as the former waited out their last few days or weeks while the latter tried to come to terms with their impending loss. It’s always a painful process, but there’s time to process the fear and grief. Not in this case. COVID-19 generally killed its victims in less than a month. Many people saw their loved ones suddenly deteriorate and die in the span of just a few days. They were gone, just like that. Everything happened so fast. Most didn’t even get to say goodbye. A colleague of mine lost her father, but even she, a health care worker, wasn’t allowed to see his body before it was cremated. It guts her to think about it: Her father’s body was taken from his hospital bed and rushed to a funeral home to be cremated. According to Chinese custom, children should dress up a deceased parent and give them a decent farewell. She later told me she regretted not being there with her father in his last hours, even though she knew it would have been impossible. And she’s tormented by the thought that she might have brought the virus home with her from work. All she can do is force herself to think, “My dad was already in his 80s. It was his time to rest.” Wuhan is full of such stories. Some residents later tracked down the hospital staff who witnessed their loved ones’ final moments, needing to hear from someone who was there that their family member wasn’t in too much pain when they died.  “An Impossible Situation” The sudden loss of a loved one is a huge emotional shock. But whereas in my past work, most family members of the deceased would gradually move past their grief during the course of treatment, many of the people I’ve talked to over the past three months are trapped in deep sorrow. Often they have trouble sleeping, so our conversations might last until late in the night. Some of my fellow volunteer counselors have reported staying online with help-seekers as late as 4 a.m. I’ve talked with people who would cry whenever they talked about their relationships with their deceased family members; people who couldn’t even stand the sight of the word sangqin — “to lose a family member”; people who would share how they had desperately tried to get their loved ones into treatment, only to watch helplessly as they died anyway. Guilt and remorse were two of the most frequently expressed emotions. Thirty-something Ling — a pseudonym — lost her father. She would repeat the same phrases over and over, like a mantra: “I should have asked my father to leave Wuhan and return to our hometown for Lunar New Year”; “If I was more capable, I could have gotten my father a hospital bed earlier, and he wouldn’t have died.” Ling’s mother passed away when she was a teenager, and she had come to see her father as a pillar in her life. In the early days of the outbreak, Wuhan suffered from acute shortages of everything from medical supplies and protective gear to hospital beds. Despite her best efforts, Ling’s father ran a high fever for at least three days before she was finally able to get him admitted to a hospital. By then it was already too late. He had always been healthy; three days later he was dead. I’ve become used to the sight of death and grief, but nothing prepared me for the trauma, guilt, and anger I’ve witnessed from those who went through so much pain trying to seek treatment. Some patients told me they had knelt down and kowtowed to doctors in a desperate bid to get treated for their symptoms — to no avail. If I were in that position, I probably wouldn’t be able to take it, either. But it was an impossible situation. Even a co-worker of mine had to wait six feverish days before she was admitted to the hospital where she worked. Others were haunted by the fear of death. I talked to people who stayed with their sick partner or parent at the hospital until the end — something that theoretically was against the rules. They saw everything. When they were then quarantined in hotels or sent home, they were terrified of the same fate awaiting them.  Getting Help Health care workers, who spent more time than anyone in close contact with the virus, have been some of the hardest hit. This may be most true of nurses, who saw to patients’ personal and medical needs, including conducting high-risk throat swabs. Some of them were under so much pressure, they would break into tears whenever they saw stories about people dying. Since March, I have been organizing mutual help sessions at our hospital where health care workers can share their experiences and feelings. Though some were at first reluctant to talk, after a few sessions they started to open up.  One nurse talked about how she had been living in fear since the pandemic started. At its peak in Wuhan, she said she would be terrified of being struck by a car while walking on an empty street, or that the buildings lining the road might collapse on her. And the people I’ve spoken with are probably the lucky ones. So many people and families have been affected by the pandemic in Wuhan, but only a few are getting professional help. It’s difficult for us to find people who need assistance, as Chinese are not quite used to the idea of therapy. During the lockdown, most of our sessions happened online, via voice or text messages, rather than over the phone or in video calls. Some were concerned about privacy, but it’s likely they also felt safer and more comfortable that way. It can be a long way back. I’ve had patients who seemed to calm down for a time after repeating their stories, but their sorrow and guilt can rebound at any moment. Sometimes it’s extremely difficult to lift their spirits. It’s like they’ve been paralyzed. And without being there physically, it can be hard to build a firm connection with them. I nevertheless try to be a presence in their lives, even when they don’t ask for my help. I’ve found many of them are still burdened with worries, anxieties, and sorrow. They need someone to talk to, even if they don’t know how to say it.  Meditations As the virus has receded in Wuhan, many residents are trying to return to their normal lives. The co-worker of mine who lost her father is gradually moving past her guilt, in part by focusing more on taking care of her still-recovering mother. Some who didn’t seek professional help are finding comfort and peace with their friends and in chat groups filled with bingyou — “fellow patients.” For my part, I’ve recently attended several meditation sessions as a way to relieve some stress. I was so busy with my work at the hospital and the volunteer counseling program, I didn’t even realize how exhausted I was until a supervising counselor reached out to me one day. Healing takes time. Life is slowly returning to Wuhan, but the city is still a far cry from normal. It’s good to hear that the last hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been cleared of the virus, but we can’t allow that to distract us from the deep psychological scars left by the last four months. One of the people I counseled said something that has stuck with me. “During the outbreak, patients and their families kept pushing forward, even through blood and tears,” she said. “Now that the epidemic is under control, the vast majority of residents are burying their grief. The challenge is to find a way to keep living.” As told to Sixth Tone’s Cai Yiwen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005565
Diary of a ‘Fangcang’ Shelter Hospital Medic,"Keting Fangcang once housed 1,500 mildly ill COVID-19 patients. Far from Wuhan’s ICUs, doctors there spent as much time tending to their patient’s emotional needs as their physical ones.",2020-04-30,"This article is part of a series of first-person accounts from medical workers who lived and worked in Wuhan over the past four months. The rest of the series can be found here. At around midnight on Feb. 9, I was pulled away from some late-night chicken wings by a call from my boss. I work in a hospital emergency room in the southern province of Guangdong, and I knew a call at that hour could only mean one thing. My wife, guessing what was coming, burst into tears. Sure enough, the hospital wanted to know if I’d be willing to join a medical support team bound for the central province of Hubei, the heart of China’s COVID-19 epidemic. “I’m happy to go if you need me,” I said. “But I need to discuss it with my family first.” To be honest, there wasn’t much to discuss. It would be hard on my family, but it was the right thing to do. I was formally notified of my selection at 1:30 a.m., finished packing after 3, and arrived at my hospital, ready to go, at 7 that morning. My co-workers, even those I didn’t really know, all hugged me goodbye. Some sneaked things like masks and gloves into my luggage. Beginning in late January, China sent more than 42,000 medical workers from all over the country to Hubei. About 2,500 were from Guangdong. My cohort consisted of 310 medics, including two nurses from my hospital. We were some of the lucky ones: We’d been given a choice. Some young doctors in our group had been plucked at random after no one in their department volunteered. Gathering for our flight, we had no idea what awaited us, how risky the work would be, how long we would be away from our families, or even where in Hubei we would be sent. I only got the answer to that last question after we arrived: Keting Fangcang, the largest fangcang shelter hospital in provincial capital Wuhan.   Feb. 13: First Impressions It’s been three days since I arrived in Wuhan. My first shift began at 2 a.m. this morning and ran for six hours. Before the epidemic, Keting’s expansive exhibition hall hosted film and art festivals. In the span of just three days in early February, the city renovated it into a makeshift hospital for around 1,500 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Fangcang hospitals have helped alleviate Wuhan’s hospital bed shortage, but another shortage still looms large: The sudden expansion of Wuhan’s medical system and intake of thousands of new, mildly ill but infectious patients has led to a surge in demand for personal protective equipment. Members of relief teams like ours were told to bring whatever we could with us, including daily essentials like masks, goggles, and protective suits. But medical gear was at a premium everywhere, and we were at a loss for where to get more. After talking it over, on Feb. 12 we decided to ask the health bureau in our city back home for help. A friend of a friend of a friend — I still don’t know his name — immediately donated 500 goggles and successfully convinced the city to send us a batch of high-quality N95 medical masks. On my first shift I toured my new workplace. The wing where I’m assigned houses more than 400 patients. With just four doctors and a handful of nurses per shift, we’re each expected to look after about 100 people. Most patients are asleep by the time the night shift starts, but some lie awake, worried they are getting sicker. I take their vital signs and reassure them everything is normal. Sometimes warm words, carefully chosen to relieve a person’s anxieties and help them get some rest, can be more effective than medicine.   Feb. 17: Long Days I’ve come to appreciate the joys of the night shift: Most patients are already asleep by the time we come on duty, and the job is easier. Day shifts are more challenging. We essentially function as community doctors. We observe patients’ conditions, manage their medications, and help them deal with their emotions. Nurses check patients’ vital signs three times a day. If a patient’s heart rate exceeds 130, body temperature exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, or blood oxygen levels fall below 93%, we arrange for them to be transferred to a hospital where more serious cases are treated. Although this might seem relatively mundane compared with the doctors in intensive care units battling to keep critically ill patients alive, fangcang hospitals carry their own risks. With hundreds of potentially highly infectious people in our care, we have to assume the coronavirus is everywhere at all times. Patients can be also be very demanding, especially after being made to wait for days for a test to see whether they still have the virus, only to keep being turned away because of continued test kit shortages. Mostly they’re anxious, but the fear that can build up over these long waits sometimes boils over into rage. On my first day shift, I was surrounded by a group of patients bombarding me with shouted questions. Some wanted to be discharged immediately, others were worried and hoped to stay longer, still more demanded to know why they hadn’t been tested yet. They coughed as they berated me, spraying me with spittle. Some even tugged on my protective suit. All it would have taken was for one of them to get carried away and tear my suit or mask, and I don’t know what would have happened.   Feb. 18: Group Therapy Most of our job is simply communicating with patients and relieving their stress. Today our fangcang hospital became one of the first to start a social media WeChat group for patients, where they can ask us questions about their conditions, talk with one another, and even post updates about their lives after they’re discharged or transferred to a different hospital. Giving patients a way to stay informed helps them feel more in control and soothes their fears. It’s helpful for us, too: There some things about post-fangcang life the doctors here only learn about from reading messages in the group. About a quarter of the patients I’ve spoken with know someone who has recently died. A few have no idea what happened to their loved ones. One day, a patient told me the elderly man in the bed next to his looked anxious and wanted to leave. He had been waiting for his test results for a long time, and he hadn’t heard from his wife for several days — she was being treated in a hospital for patients with more severe symptoms. He was terrified that something had happened to her. Eventually we asked a local Wuhanese nurse to go to the hospital where the woman was being treated and check on her.   March 1: Decompression Doctors are not any more immune to the stress of fangcang life than patients. We have one six-hour shift every 30 hours, but the stress of battling an unknown illness in an unfamiliar environment far from home is taking its toll. Even when we’re off-duty, we aren’t allowed to leave the confines of our hotel. But since we can’t spend all our time cooped up in our rooms, we’ll occasionally drop in on each other to chat — maintaining a safe distance, of course. Some have taken up indoor running, clocking 6 kilometers a day without leaving their rooms. During night shifts, after all the patients are asleep, I’ll sit down and talk with the nurses on duty. Like us, they hail from all over China. Most of them left their families back home to come here; some have children too young to walk. Sometimes it’s easier to chat about the foods we miss or make plans to visit each other when all this is over. There have been challenges and conflicts, but what’s struck me most about my time in Wuhan is the respect our patients show us. One night, after I got off a shift at 2 a.m., I went into my office to rest. I found a woman taking photos with her cellphone. She said she was being discharged from the hospital the next day and that she felt indebted to the medical staff who had left their homes to help her. She wanted to record a video with all the doctors and nurses so she wouldn’t forget us. In seven years of practicing medicine, I’d never encountered anything like it.   March 17: On the Road I’d already sent my luggage and supplies home by express mail. I was ready to collapse by the time I was done, when suddenly I received a call from a bus driver I met in Wuhan. We had gotten to know each other when he ferried me to work one day. I was late for my shift because of a stomachache, so I was the only one on the shuttle to the hospital. As we talked, he told me his family was safe and sound, but the mother of one of his co-workers had died. She probably had COVID-19, though she had never been formally diagnosed. He was one of a number of Wuhan bus drivers who voluntarily signed up to provide shuttle services to doctors and others who needed to get around while the city was under lockdown. There’s one shuttle every 15 minutes. Each driver works nonstop for six hours at a time. To stay on schedule, they frequently eat their meals squatting on the side of the road. After he dropped me off, I sent him some daily necessities, including masks. I hadn’t expected to hear from him again, but he called to say goodbye after learning our team was leaving Wuhan — we’d discharged our last patient on March 8. He told me he was touched by my gifts and had shared some of what I had sent with his neighbors. And if I was ever back in Wuhan, he said, his family would give me a full tour of the city. Such small expressions of gratitude have become commonplace. Many security guards, police officers, and volunteers at the fangcang hospital had signed up to be there of their own accord. Looking back, I didn’t really have a choice: Dealing with outbreaks is part of my job. They did have a choice, and still they were willing to run the risk.   March 20: Home We left Wuhan today. As our convoy moved through the city, cars honked their horns for us at every intersection, and residents leaned out of their windows to wave farewell. I have no interest in being called a hero, but the doctors I spoke with in Wuhan all agreed the epidemic represented a peak in the reputation of medical workers in China. Even just a few months ago, it seemed routine to read about doctors being harmed or even killed by disgruntled patients. Now that feels so long ago. This winter, mutual understanding reigned as doctors and patients both seemed to understand that no one had it easy. Still, my co-workers and I would sometimes debate about whether patients would continue to be kind to us once this is all over. All we can do is hope. The other day, my hospital asked me for a photo from my time in Wuhan. They wanted me to write a few lines to go with it, but all I could manage was three words. “Here’s to normalcy.” As told to Sixth Tone’s Cai Yiwen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005472
China’s Travel Firms Brace for Make-or-Break Holiday,Tourism businesses are trying everything to lure visitors ahead of the May Day holiday. But many consumers remain reluctant to travel far.,2020-04-30,"SHANGHAI — In over a decade working as a tour guide, Lin Xi had never been so excited to receive a booking. Last week, a family from Shanghai confirmed a two-day trip to Suzhou, a city just over 70 kilometers away, for the upcoming May Day holiday. During normal times, the 600 yuan ($85) gig would barely be worth mentioning. But Lin feels incredibly lucky to have it: Most of her colleagues have no work at all. “The number of clients has decreased by 99% compared with any time in the past 10 years — in fact, we basically have none,” Lin tells Sixth Tone. “Some tour guides … had no choice but to find a temporary job to make a living.” China’s vast tourism sector is showing tentative signs of recovery amid a decline in the country’s COVID-19 infections, but the industry is still facing major disruptions ahead of the May Day break, which begins Friday. Travel firms have been banking on an uptick in demand over the public holiday to bring some relief from the worst slump to hit the industry in decades. This past November, the Chinese government extended the 2020 May Day holiday to five days in an attempt to boost consumption.  Cities have taken extraordinary steps to attract visitors ahead of the holiday. Tourism bureau officials hosted special livestream shows to promote local attractions. Haikou, in tropical Hainan province, released millions of yuan in “consumption coupons” and offered heavy discounts on flights, hotels, and tourist venues. But the measures appear to have only had a limited impact. Trip.com Group, a leading online travel firm, estimates Chinese travelers will make around 90 million trips over the May Day break. That’s more than double the number of trips made during the Qingming Festival holiday earlier this month, but less than half the figure for the May Day holiday last year.  Despite the fall in new coronavirus cases in China since March, the tourism sector still faces some virus-control restrictions, which is impacting demand. Travel firms are banned from organizing tours for travelers outside their home provinces. Schools in at least 15 cities have told students and teachers not to travel during the holiday. And popular destinations like the eastern mountain Huangshan have been ordered to only admit 30% their usual number of visitors to avoid overcrowding. Many consumers, meanwhile, remain wary of unnecessary travel. According to super app Meituan, nearly 90% of the May Day trips booked through its platform are to local destinations, significantly more than usual. Jessie Pan, a 28-year-old from Shanghai, tells Sixth Tone she recently cancelled a planned four-day trip to Guilin, a popular destination in Southwest China, over the holiday on her parents’ advice. “Both my parents are worried about the safety of taking a flight, and they forced me to cancel it,” she says. “But staying at home for five days is totally a waste of time. I think maybe I can go to a neighboring city.”  Deng Cen, a 22-year-old who works at a bank in the central city of Changsha, had to lie to her family so she could travel to southwestern Chongqing. “I told my parents I’m traveling with friends to make them feel comfortable,” says Deng, adding that her partner had decided not to join her. “I’ll be cautious and avoid the popular tourist attractions.” For thousands of companies in China’s tourism sector — which generated annual revenues of 6.6 trillion yuan and provided around 10% of the country’s jobs last year — the main goal has simply become survival after all the dramatic income plummets since January.  As the coronavirus began to spread in the country, cities went under lockdown, airlines cut flights, tourist attractions and public venues shut down, and several countries imposed travel bans. China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism banned travel agents from selling package holidays and group tours ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. In February, the China Tourism Academy estimated that domestic tourism revenues would see negative growth of nearly 70% in the first quarter, and the industry would experience losses of 1.2 trillion yuan for the whole year. Han Wei, 33, who manages a customer service call center for Trip.com, recalls being deluged with calls from customers wanting to cancel bookings from late January. The number of enquiries more than tripled during the height of the epidemic, he estimates. “Our colleagues would choose to skip lunch,” says Han. “Even if you had time to heat up your meal, you didn’t have time to finish it.”  Trip.com was among several online travel firms to offer full refunds to consumers wishing to cancel bookings due to the pandemic. In late March, the company said it had handled over 30 million cancelations worth a combined 31 billion yuan. “In the spring, the only calls we got were to cancel orders,” says Han. “But as long as the clients want to talk about their problems, I’m always ready to help.” The spread of COVID-19 across the world has dealt a second blow just as Chinese firms were hoping to move on from the crisis. In early April, Pew Research Center estimated that 90% of the global population now lives in countries with some form of travel restrictions, while around 3 billion people are in places completely closed off to nonresidents. Liu Zeng, another customer services representative at Trip.com who mainly serves the firm’s Japanese clients, tells Sixth Tone his workload surged again in March, after the announcement that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics would be postponed. “Again, I was having to answer 60 to 70 phone calls every day,” says Liu. “Some wanted to cancel their deals with a full refund, while others wanted to change their bookings to next year.”  The World Travel and Tourism Council predicts that $2.7 trillion in economic activity will be lost globally in 2020 due to the decline in travel and tourism caused by COVID-19. Asia-Pacific will be hit hardest, with over $1 trillion in lost activity and 64 million job losses. Chen Yong, an assistant professor at the Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne in Switzerland who specializes in tourism economics, tells Sixth Tone that COVID-19 is the worst crisis the global tourism industry has ever faced, far surpassing previous shocks such as the 2001 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2003 SARS epidemic, and the 2008 financial crisis. “The impact of those incidents was quite regional and limited as far as the global tourism industry was concerned,” says Chen. “But this year, we can see shrinking demand for travel worldwide.”  For Chen, China’s tourism sector will only truly start to recover once the pandemic is brought under control globally. “If the pandemic is still out of control in the second half of the year, the economic impact will not only affect demand from tourists, but also the number of travel-related companies — they might not survive,” says Chen. But the crisis might also drive improvements in the domestic tourism industry, forcing firms to improve their standards of service, according to Chen. “There’s huge tourist traffic from China to the rest of the world, but not the other way around,” says Chen. “Now, it’s a good chance for restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions to examine their hospitality and improve their quality of service.” Lin, the tour guide, has already noticed this trend in her own industry. Guides with a big following on social media, she says, are fully booked for the May Day holiday. “Only the top people in the industry will never be wiped out,” Lin says.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005585
"In Wuhan, a COVID-19 Tester’s Search for Answers","To contain the coronavirus, doctors first needed to know who had it. That was easier said than done.",2020-04-29,"This article is part of a series of first-person accounts from medical workers who lived and worked in Wuhan over the past four months. The rest of the series can be found here. The first time my lab team processed nucleic acid tests given to suspected COVID-19 patients, only 30% of them came back positive. All of us, physicians and testers alike, were stunned. Most of the individuals tested had clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and low blood oxygen levels, as well as a history of close contact with confirmed patients. Sometimes we gave patients multiple tests, only for their samples to come back negative again and again before they would finally test positive. We quickly realized the nucleic acid tests we were using at the time, which were tricky to administer and reliant on a newly developed and not yet entirely reliable reagent, were prone to false negatives. As the only officially recognized means of confirming COVID-19 diagnoses, they remained vital, but if we wanted to filter out the noise while we waited for an upgraded version, we needed to look elsewhere. The seven weeks I spent in the central city of Wuhan helping doctors search for this strange and previously unknown virus were filled with unending bouts of trial and error. Even now, nearly half a year into what has become a global pandemic, there’s much I still don’t know.  Nucleic Waste I landed in Wuhan on the night of Jan. 24 as part of a medical support team sent from the southern Guangdong province to the epicenter of the country’s COVID-19 outbreak. I did my master’s in virology, a three-year doctorate in laboratory medicine and testing, and have spent the past three years working in a medical laboratory. As such, I was confident I could handle the job. Even before pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan finally publicly acknowledged that the coronavirus could be passed from person-to-person on Jan. 20, I never put much stock in official pronouncements that such transmission wasn’t taking place or that young people were somehow not susceptible to the disease. Of course, I also didn’t believe the terrible stories trickling out of Wuhan until I got there and saw them for myself. In the early days of the pandemic, the city’s hospitals and clinics were inundated with thousands of potentially infected residents searching for an explanation for their fevers, coughs, and breathing problems. It was imperative to identify who had COVID-19 and who didn’t — if only to keep the two groups from infecting each other at the hospital. That would generally be done by administering a nucleic acid test, which can identify the presence of the coronavirus in patients’ respiratory tracts. Later, China would also allow doctors to diagnose COVID-19 on the basis of a positive antibody test result, if given in conjunction with a nucleic acid test. Antibody tests check for unique proteins produced by the body to fight off the virus and are generally faster and easier to process than nucleic acid tests. But it takes time for the body to make antibodies, so the tests are less reliable in the initial stages of the disease’s progression in patients.  In late January, however, we were still a month away from the first government-approved antibody tests hitting the market. Reliable nucleic acid tests were usually in short supply, and some inpatients who were given an early version tested negative three or four times before testing positive. You could improve the accuracy of the nucleic acid test by getting a sample from deep inside the patient’s respiratory tract, where the virus tends to cluster, but this was highly uncomfortable for the patient, and they would often start hacking and wheezing all over the person conducting the test. Even being covered from head-to-toe in protective equipment wasn’t enough to ease some of my colleagues’ fears about being splashed with potentially infectious spittle. On Feb. 3, Zhang Xiaochun, a medical imaging expert at Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital, became the first physician to publicly propose supplementing nucleic acid tests with CT scans of patients’ lungs. Unlike nucleic acid tests, CT scans are simple to perform and return results quickly. On Feb. 4, one day after Zhang’s proposal, China’s National Health Commission allowed doctors in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province to make clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 based on CT scans. A week later, the province added almost 15,000 cases to its tally. But CT scans posed the opposite problem: too many false positives. Influenza, for example, can be difficult to differentiate from COVID-19 on lung scans, but treating influenza patients alongside COVID-19 patients risked cross-infection. The health authorities eventually halted the practice of using CT scans to confirm cases. Early on, however, our primary goal was simply arresting COVID-19’s spread in the city. Many doctors were willing to overlook CT scans’ deficiencies as a diagnostic tool out of a belief that it was better to misdiagnose influenza as COVID-19 than risk missing a case of the latter. Still, nucleic acid tests remained the primary way my hospital officially diagnosed COVID-19 patients until antibody tests became available in late February.  Capped Out Before I went to Wuhan, I heard that manufacturers were already at work producing the components needed for nucleic acid test kits, so I assumed there would be an adequate supply. I soon found that production was unable to keep up with the rising numbers of patients, and logistics networks, jammed by nationwide lockdowns, were struggling to deliver the tests where they were needed. On Jan. 25, the day after I arrived, Wuhan’s health commission authorized 13 labs to process nucleic acid tests. This should have increased overall capacity from 300 to 2,000 tests per day. Yet there were more than five times as many patients in need of testing. At the time, our hospital’s quota for nucleic acid testing was just 20 tests per day. We had more than 80 patients in our inpatient ward, not to mention hundreds of visitors to our outpatient clinic every day. Although our testing cap gradually increased to more than 70 before eventually being lifted entirely, that still didn’t solve our problems: Because our hospital’s laboratory didn’t meet the necessary standards to process the tests, the samples had to be sent out to a third party. On average, it took around five days to get the results back. Given how quickly COVID-19 patients’ symptoms can change, this delay complicated physicians’ efforts to monitor and diagnose patients. It also limited treatment capacity: Beds were scarce, and delays in processing made it hard to free up resources in time for those in need.  Searching for the Unknown Facing a disease with so many unknowns, my team worked nonstop to detect the virus as accurately as possible, and we never stopped experimenting. Antibody testing, which came into use in late February, helped exclude the false positives created by using CT scans as a diagnostic tool. And because antibody tests were less demanding, we could process them at the hospital ourselves, without needing to send them to a third-party lab. If either a nucleic acid or antibody test came back positive, then we could officially confirm a case. But like everything else we used, antibody tests posed unique challenges. Reliability varied from brand to brand, and the kits didn’t come with clear instructions, increasing the margin of error. For example, a test kit’s sensitivity and accuracy differed depending on whether you tested a patient’s blood serum or blood plasma. In order to increase the accuracy of our results, we compared new kits as they became available, all while experimenting with different testing methods. In one two-week period, we carried out over 2,000 antibody tests while changing brands five times. Because our patients all had different constitutions, underlying illnesses, and infections, their antibody counts also varied. For example, some patients naturally produce very few antibodies, and others might take twice as long to produce the proteins. Faced by a virus we could not fully explain, we were always discussing and debating the significance of “weird” or outlier cases. Beginning in late February, a small number of patients who had tested negative for COVID-19 twice and been discharged from the hospital later tested positive for the virus. This attracted a lot of public concern, especially as similar cases had been reported elsewhere, including in South Korea. I personally came across two such cases, both of which involved either antibody production that was very low or very slow. In one of them, the patient had initially been hospitalized for a high fever and diagnosed with COVID-19. They were eventually discharged after testing negative twice, as per the guidelines. More than half a month later, the man again developed a fever and returned to the hospital, where he was given another nucleic acid test. This time it came back positive. Later, we found he was producing relatively low quantities of antibodies compared with other patients, potentially leaving him vulnerable to reinfection. These were isolated incidents, and the risk of reinfection remains unclear. We are, however, continuing to monitor the situation. There are still a lot of unanswered questions about COVID-19. In particular, the effectiveness and longevity of antibodies — which could conceivably offer resistance to future infections — are among the most pressing concerns. By the end of my time in Wuhan, doctors and testers were relying on a combination of CT scans, antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests to identify and confirm COVID-19 infections, but there’s still much we don’t know. It’s possible this fight is far from over.  Removing the Cowl Laboratory staff worked every day. During our shifts — which lasted eight hours, if you count all the time spent putting on and taking off protective gear — we were unable to eat or go to the bathroom. Every time I put on my protective suit, I could feel myself tensing up. On the plus side, the work was so stressful, I didn’t have time to feel hungry. Regardless of my protective gear, I worried about being in close contact with virus samples every day. As a frontline medical worker, some dangers are unavoidable. Then you go home and start to worry about everything that could have happened or whether you’re now infected. That feeling doesn’t go away overnight. Many of us needed time to adjust after returning home. It was different from a normal business trip, not least because I never expected to stay for two months. I was constantly on edge the whole time I was there. Just like Wuhan itself, getting back to normal may take some time. As told to Sixth Tone’s Cai Yiwen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005564
Chinese Cities Advise Against Holiday Travel Amid COVID-19,"To prevent possible coronavirus infections, many schools are discouraging families from traveling over the upcoming Labor Day holiday.",2020-04-29,"China has an extended Labor Day holiday this year, but many schools are discouraging teachers and students from traveling outside their cities to prevent coronavirus cases. Education authorities in at least 15 cities have issued notices asking — and in some cases ordering — staff and students to opt for tours in and around their current locations, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. The travel restrictions apply to primary schools, secondary schools, and kindergartens. In Luoyang, a city in central China’s Henan province, teachers and students must receive approval to leave the city for the five-day holiday, which starts Friday. Local authorities have banned travel to high-risk outbreak zones, as well as strictly prohibited all cross-city, cross-province, and cross-country tourism. Currently, Beijing’s Chaoyang District is the only high-risk zone for COVID-19 in China. On Monday, the deputy head of the capital’s publicity department said that students and school staff should not leave the city in order to reduce the risk of infection. Meanwhile, Qitaihe in the northeastern Heilongjiang province is asking teachers and students hoping to leave the city to file leave requests that are subject to approval by local education authorities. With cities in Heilongjiang on alert after an uptick in imported coronavirus cases, Qitaihe is also enforcing 14 days’ home quarantine and nucleic acid testing for people returning to the city. “Teachers, students, and parents: Please diligently protect yourselves, postpone your travel plans, and don’t leave the country. Try not to leave your place of residence to reduce the risk of infection,” local media quoted provincial education authorities as saying. Yang Dechao, the father of a first-grader in Henan province, told Sixth Tone that his family often goes on trips at this time of the year. But after receiving strict instructions from his son’s primary school, which is scheduled to open shortly after the holiday, he’s having second thoughts. “Because of the virus, we don’t actually have plans to travel,” Yang said, adding that the mandatory quarantines upon returning act as another deterrent. In Zhuzhou, another city in central China, teachers and students are required to report their whereabouts to their school, and those opting to travel outside the city are only allowed back to school after obtaining a health certificate indicating that they’re virus-free. After months of being closed during the COVID-19 outbreak, China’s schools are cautiously starting to reopen. In the eastern city of Hangzhou — where classes have resumed for primary schoolers, as well as ninth and 12th graders preparing for entrance exams — education authorities are asking teachers and students to refrain from traveling. The stay-at-home policies are a blow to tour operators that might have been eagerly eyeing the Labor Day holiday as a source of sorely needed income. Shanghai-based online travel agency Trip.com says it’s expecting only 90 million trips over the five-day break, less than half as many as last year’s 195 million. In a statement to Sixth Tone, the company said that while outbound tourism and domestic trips have not yet recovered, there has been an increase in local tourism. Bookings for shorter trips with fewer travelers, as well as local group tours, are seeing a rebound, though many tourist attractions are still limiting the number of visitors to avoid large crowds.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005581
"Men More at Risk of Dying From COVID-19, Study Suggests",Chinese researchers determined that men were 2.4 times more likely to die from the novel coronavirus than women.,2020-04-29,"Doctors in China have found that, based on a small sample size, the novel coronavirus appears to be more fatal to men. According to a study published Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, the research team concluded that, while both sexes were equally susceptible to the disease, men were 2.4 times more likely to die than women. Of the country’s first 37 COVID-19 casualties, about 70% were male, compared with 30% female. The analysis was based on the earliest 1,056 COVID-19 cases reported by the Chinese authorities. “Our sample size is small because there wasn’t enough data when we started studying the sex difference,” Yang Jinkui, an endocrinologist at Beijing Tongren Hospital and a co-author of the study, told Sixth Tone. “So we compared the trend against SARS patients and found similar results.” The SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people globally in 2003, with Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland reporting the most deaths. For the new study, the research team investigated 524 SARS patients in Beijing and found the death rate was significantly higher in men than in women. Though it remains unknown why COVID-19 appears to be more fatal to men, Yang said it could be linked to an enzyme in the human body. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV — the viruses that cause COVID-19 and SARS, respectively — invade the human body by binding to an enzyme called ACE2. A previous study found that men had higher levels of ACE2 circulating in their bodies than women, meaning the virus might attack men more easily, Yang said. “It’s becoming clearer from recent data that men were two to three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than women,” he said. “Our research suggests that doctors should monitor male severe cases and provide intensive care earlier on.” Reports from other countries have also suggested that men may be more susceptible to the new coronavirus. A study from Italy found that 82% of 1,591 critically ill COVID-19 patients were men, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also suggested that men might be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 compared with women.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005579
"As Summer Nears, Farmers Struggle to Get Crawfish on the Table","Raising the tasty crustaceans has become big business in central China. But in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, breeders are going broke.",2020-04-28,"HUBEI, Central China — It’s 3 a.m. and Yao Yong is already up. He puts on his uniform, dons a headlamp, and heads straight to the pond near his village. After measuring the water’s temperature, he gathers his net. “Crawfish love the water at around 20 degrees (Celsius), and at night, it’s about that temperature,” he says. Two hours later, Yao and scores of fellow farmers sell their morning catch to the crawfish collectors, who in turn transport the creatures — the “little dragon shrimps,” as they’re called in Chinese — to the processing plants. Yao owns 40 mu (about 2.6 hectares) of land in Zhishu Village of Qianjiang City, known as China’s “crawfish hometown.” He mainly harvests the crustacean, as well as wheat, corn, and soybeans, which can be used as crawfish feed. While Yao earns about 150,000 yuan ($21,000) every year from farming, at least two-thirds of that comes from the crawfish.  But this year, there isn’t much time left for Yao and the crawfish industry. While in the throes of the country’s COVID-19 epidemic, many regions in the central Hubei province — which produces half the country’s crawfish — ordered strict closure policies to curb the spread of the virus in late January, with sales and produce also suspended. With Hubei’s annual crawfish catching season starting in late February and lasting until early June, Yao and the province’s crawfish business have a small window of opportunity and are staring at a crisis. Situated in the northern and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Hubei, known as the “land of a thousand lakes,” is a province of considerable bodies of water. It is the country’s largest freshwater fish-producing province, and crawfish is the region’s dominant industry to supplement farming incomes. But the epidemic and its aftermath have caused a “serious backlog of seedlings and processed crawfish,” and the development of the industry is “very grim,” the Hubei Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department said late March.  Compared with previous years during the same period, the sales volume of crawfish seedlings and the price they usually fetch have decreased by half, says Gong Dingrong, mayor of Qianjiang. “The logistics channel has not been fully opened, which makes it difficult for crawfish and related products to be quickly delivered to all parts of the country.” On March 13, the day the lockdown was lifted for Qianjiang City, many of the farmers there rushed to catch and sell crawfish from their ponds. “In the previous months, we couldn’t feed them or clean the water. Their growth has been affected,” Yao tells Sixth Tone. He, however, preferred a more patient approach, saying he would wait until the crawfish grew large enough to sell at a better price. Yao, 43, quit his job as a physical education teacher and began working on crawfish farms in 2000 for a better income. He soon became a major producer of the crustaceans in the village and was appointed as the village secretary in 2017. Nearly 80% of the village’s 1,000 residents raise crawfish, and half the farmland — about 1,150 mu — is now used as paddy fields for crawfish production.  What worries farmers this season is the price of crawfish, which varies from week to week, day to day, according to Yao. He estimates the overall price to have fallen 40% from last year. When Sixth Tone visits Zhishu Village on April 15, the price has risen by 6 to 8 yuan per kilogram in two days, totaling 58 yuan per kilogram. But during the same period last year, they were sold at over 100 yuan per kilogram. The price also varies across villages. Zhang Taixin in a nearby town tells Sixth Tone in mid-April that his crawfish sold at 50 yuan per kilogram — the best price he’s gotten all week. “Last year, we could earn 3,000 yuan from 1 mu of land; this year, we’d be lucky to get 2,000 yuan,” Yao says. To bolster business, in late March, the province’s finance department implemented supportive policies to local crawfish enterprises, including a preferential guarantee and a one-time financial discount.  In addition, the Hubei Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department has signed strategic cooperation agreements with Chinese e-commerce giants to help the crawfish industry recover. On April 2, Chinese online retailer JD.com announced a plan to sell 100,000 tons of crawfish sourced from Hubei. Soon after, e-commerce giant Alibaba said it would purchase crawfish worth 1 billion yuan from the Hubei cities of Qianjiang, Jianli, and Honghu from April to August this year, then selling the produce across more than 4,000 stores online and offline to boost thousands of farmers’ incomes. In April, crawfish were available on the market in large quantities for the first time this year in Qianjiang. The produce has been sold across 402 cities in the country, with Shanghai, Beijing, eastern Hangzhou, and southwestern Chongqing the main markets. Qianjiang’s top officer described in a livestreaming event held on March 21 to promote the delicacy that crawfish produced in the city were “high protein, low fat, environmentally friendly, healthy, springy, and delicious.” Crawfish, a species not indigenous to the area, are believed to have been introduced into China by the Japanese in the 1930s, and eventually discovered in the Hubei area’s rice paddies in the 1980s. Around 2001, some farmers from Qianjiang began to catch baby crawfish in natural ditches and sell them at markets. Offline, the number of crayfish stores in 2018 soared by 70% compared with the previous year, according to an industry report. Online, the market share for crawfish takeout also increased significantly. According to delivery app Meituan, the order volume of crawfish deliveries through its platform in 2018 was 2.6 times higher than in 2017.  The popularity of crawfish has also been fueled by the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, during which Alibaba’s food delivery app Ele.me delivered over 3 million crawfish and 400,000 bottles of beer for each game. Meanwhile, 100,000 crawfish were sent to Russia from Hubei during the games, further expanding the popularity of the crustacean. Due to Chinese people’s love for the so-called little lobster, crawfish chefs with more than three years of experience can earn up to 50,000 yuan a month. Graduates from Qianjiang Crayfish School can make an average monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan, twice as much as others with college degrees in the province. Over in Gucheng Village, Zhang resumed catching and selling during the second week of April. The 74-year-old has invested 7,000 yuan in this year’s business and so far has earned about 3,000 yuan. “I don’t think I’ll lose money, but the profit will be very small because the price is too low,” he tells Sixth Tone. The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown measures have been a double whammy for the crawfish sector. Fu Wenge, an agricultural economics professor at China Agricultural University, says the price of crawfish has been affected by both the pandemic and an already saturated domestic market. In 2018, the crawfish market in China was worth 369 billion yuan, increasing 37.5% from the previous year, according to an industry report published in 2019.  “There are going to be problems in this industry,” says Fu, who believes supply in the crawfish industry outstrips the demand. “In fact, I think the decline might have some benefits: Hasn’t it developed too fast in the past?” While farmers say the declining price of crawfish has left them with a smaller profit margin, Fu believes the industry is affected directly by February’s disrupted logistics chain, which is when they’d usually sell the produce. The price of crawfish, on the other hand, has not declined much, losing just 25% to 30% of its value, according to his estimates. The vulnerable catering industry, already battered by the pandemic, has meant fewer consumers want crawfish. “The demand is now mainly driven by catering, because the biggest part of crawfish sales is in the catering sector. If not for the COVID-19 pandemic, there would be other problems. It (the pandemic) only worsens it,” says Fu. Compounding the problem is another infectious disease, white spot syndrome, which could cause the crawfish to die come May without proper management. Zhang and other farmers in Qianjiang hope the price of crawfish will increase with the catering sector as the province springs back to life.  But the pandemic’s ripple effects have impacted this industry, too. Liang Yong, manager of a crawfish restaurant chain in Qianjiang tells Sixth Tone their business hasn’t made a profit this year. Since their restaurants reopened April 1, sales have increased, but it is far from their previous standards. “This time last year, we had 1,000 people eating in the restaurant every day, but now we only see about 400,” she says.  In late March when many restaurants reopened, the volume of food delivery orders in Wuhan, the city at the heart of China’s outbreak, saw a three-fold jump over the previous week, according to Meituan. Crawfish delivery orders skyrocketed 11 times higher than the previous week. Yet, many Wuhan residents are still cautious about eating takeout, fearing infection. Despite his love for spicy crawfish, Wang Dawei hasn’t tasted any this year. He’s been cooking at home with his wife since the city went into lockdown in mid-January. “We worry that food from outside might contain the virus,” he says. Meanwhile, the small store they own in a shopping mall is losing 1,000 yuan per day, and “ordering a 200 yuan snack seems like a luxury at this moment.” On the other hand, Liao Fan, another Wuhan resident, ordered over 1,000 yuan in crawfish with hot chiles and piles of garlic as soon as his favorite restaurant resumed takeout services in early April. He puts on disposable plastic gloves to peel the shells while drinking beer with his family of five at home. “Eating crawfish is the symbol of a Wuhan summer,” Zhang says. “As long as the odor of spicy crawfish permeates the air, we smell hope in the city.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005572
China’s Zoos Must Prep for a Post-Pandemic World,"The economic fallout of the COVID-19 outbreak is endangering the country’s zoos, but can they reopen while keeping their occupants safe?",2020-04-27,"Last week, Wuhan Zoo finally reopened to the public, three months after it was closed due to the city’s COVID-19 outbreak. Zoos — along with their animal residents — have been quiet victims of the ongoing pandemic. In late March, a large number of animals in an indoor zoo in the central city of Changsha starved to death, an outcome one employee blamed on the zoo’s indebted owner and the economic losses caused by COVID-19. The problem isn’t limited to China. In April, the Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany announced that, if it runs out of funds for animal feed, or if it cannot source enough, “animals housed in the zoo will be euthanized.” They even drew up a list of which of its more than 700 animals would be put down. Wuhan Zoo was lucky to avoid a similar fate. On Feb. 1, a little over a week after the city went into lockdown, zoo management appealed to the public to donate fresh feed for the park’s waterfowl. “To keep our loveable animals alive, we desperately require donations of seafood such as small freshwater fish, loaches, capelin, small yellow croakers, and shrimp skin,” its statement read. Thankfully, caring residents and businesses were quick to respond, and the zoo’s population successfully weathered the brunt of the storm. The zoo has even welcomed new family members over the past three months. Two baby elks and a pony were born during the closure; five black swan eggs hatched; and its ducks, red-crowned cranes, bar-headed geese, and peacocks are all busy guarding their eggs. These births are a testament to the tenacity and beauty of life, and a bit of good news in otherwise dire times. Wuhan Zoo’s animals were able to find safety in the original epicenter of the pandemic mainly because it’s a public institution. Public zoos have suffered less during the current global health crisis thanks to government funding, while private zoos must rely on their own cash flow and prayers for state-subsidy relief. That may be possible for larger institutions, but many smaller zoos have been forced to permanently shut down.  Even public zoos aren’t immune to plummeting ticket sales. At least one zoo in northern China has slashed employees’ salaries to make it through the pandemic, though fortunately its animals have not been affected. That could change as zoos start to reopen to the public, however. Following the Bronx Zoo’s announcement on April 5 that a Malayan tiger named Nadia had contracted COVID-19, it seems increasingly likely that animals can contract the coronavirus from humans. Seven other large cats in the park — four tigers and three African lions — have since tested positive, and studies suggest that domestic cats and ferrets are also susceptible. So far, it seems the complications of COVID-19 are not life-threatening for felines. What has conservationists really worried are the great apes, including orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. There is currently no research on the risks posed by COVID-19 to these species, mainly because no one dares conduct it: The ethical and economic costs of these experiments would be unacceptably high. However, basic biology tells us it’s very likely that transmission is possible. In 2018, scientists conducting a review of academic research discovered 31 suspected cases of human-to-ape transmission of infectious disease between 1964 and 2012, including influenza and Ebola. These cases, which were not limited to any one species and included both apes in captivity and in the wild, led the study’s authors to conclude that human-to-ape transmission posed a “growing threat” to primate conservation. There is thus a real risk that great apes held in zoos could be infected with the coronavirus. Furthermore, many conservationists worry that human activity will cause COVID-19 to spread to ape populations in the wild, bringing disaster to already endangered species. China’s zoos are reinforcing their disease prevention measures, including by setting limits on the number of daily visitors, as well as requiring visitors to wear masks and have their temperatures taken. The Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens issued a document telling its members to close indoor venues to the public and stop visitors from feeding animals. Not all institutions are complying with these recommendations, however: Jinan Wildlife Park in eastern China still allows visitors to feed animals for an extra fee, for example. Wuhan Zoo provides an example of a more responsible reopening. Currently, it has set a limit of 15,000 visitors at any time. All outdoor animal venues in the park are open, but its four indoor areas are temporarily closed. Visitors must wear masks and maintain a distance of more than 1 meter from one another at all times. Such precautions may become the new normal for China’s zoos during the next year or two. But I hope that, in addition to taking extra safety measures, the pandemic will push us to rethink the relationship between humans and animals. With few exceptions, we should interfere as little as possible with animals’ wild habitats and put their safety and well-being above all else.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005571
How Wuhan Cared for Pandemic’s ‘Temporary Orphans’,"With thousands of moms and dads sick or quarantined, volunteers lent a parenting hand.",2020-04-27,"HUBEI, Central China — When social worker Li Ren told her son she’d be going on a monthlong business trip, it was the biggest lie she’d ever told him. In truth, Li was volunteering to enter a quarantine center in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province where China’s COVID-19 outbreak began, so she could accompany a 4-year-old daughter of hospitalized coronavirus patients. “Her grandmother died of the disease, and both of her parents were ill,” Li tells Sixth Tone. “Nobody in the family was able to look after her.” On Feb. 19, Li received a call from a local government officer asking her to help out. The girl’s mother, who hadn’t immediately been admitted to the hospital because she only had mild symptoms, received word that a bed had become available. And so Li, after convincing her husband this was the right thing to do, set out into the cold and quiet night to pick up the girl, Yiyi — a pseudonym to protect her privacy.  When Li met Yiyi, she was timid, with her hair in a ponytail and her eyes red from crying. It was close to dawn when the two arrived at a hotel-turned-quarantine center and were given a room on the seventh floor, which housed six more children — ages 4 to 17 — who were all in the same situation as Yiyi. There are no public figures on how many children in Wuhan were left without guardians during the height of the country’s epidemic. But with 3,869 deaths and more than 50,000 confirmed infections, thousands of families lacked caretakers as they spent weeks in treatment, recovery, and quarantine. As Wuhan was cut off from the rest of the country since Jan. 23 to contain the virus’ spread, out-of-city relatives were unable to help out, as was the case with Yiyi’s family. In late January, the plight of children left without guardians due to the coronavirus outbreak became front page news in China after a 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy died alone at home after his father had to go into quarantine. After public outcry, China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs on Feb. 11 tasked local officials with reporting and taking care of children left alone due to the pandemic. However, during a time when lower-level officials were flooded with a range of urgent responsibilities, care for these children was often patchy in practice. Fang Li, the mother of two children who were quarantined on the same floor as Yiyi, tells Sixth Tone the solution her residential committee originally suggested was having her 13-year-old daughter take care of her 4-year-old son at home. “I said, if you don’t help me, then I’d just as soon be shut out on the balcony and quarantined with the children, never leaving my apartment,” Fang says.  Cindy Chen, a Wuhan resident who spent time in a so-called fangcang shelter hospital, told Sixth Tone in early March that a girl in her ward was there without her parents. She also recalled seeing a man who had tested negative for the virus checking himself in so he could be with his infected child. Xu Jing, founder of child care nongovernmental organization Qiansuilan, tells Sixth Tone that, before her group’s volunteers entered the quarantine center, nobody there was taking full-time care of the children — some of whom, like Yiyi, were only 4 years old. Many needed not just physical care but also emotional support, having experienced their families shaken up by disease and sometimes death. Li had previously worked for an NGO providing children and the elderly with psychological counseling and other services for two years. But she had never had to care for someone so intimately or under such stressful conditions. Living together in the same room, it took a while before the fragile and frightened Yiyi opened up to Li. “Whenever I tried to talk to her, she never replied,” Li recalls. Yiyi never screamed or cried, appearing traumatized by her family’s situation. Once, when Li helped the girl change her clothes in the morning, she found Yiyi had wet her bed.  To get Yiyi to let her guard down, Li only wore a mask instead of the entire protective outfit that was standard at the quarantine center, since all children had been in close contact with their infected relatives. Every time doctors wearing protective suits and goggles entered the room to check their body temperatures, fear was visible in Yiyi’s eyes, Li remembers. “She would keep walking backward and not say a word. She just stared at them as if they were monsters.”  Li’s efforts worked. After three days, Yiyi became more willing to talk and started smiling. When watching TV, she would point out her favorite characters, and the two sang and danced together. To not add to Yiyi’s worries, Li didn’t allow her to make video calls with her mother, who agreed it was best the girl didn’t see her sick and grieving. While Li accompanied Yiyi round-the-clock, Zhou Huiqin, another volunteer on the seventh floor, was taking care of six children at once. “Thinking about these children in need of a caretaker, I felt it was my duty to help out,” says the 52-year-old. “Only later did I find out how stressful it is. You have to be very careful in every aspect of their care.” Zhou — who works for Xu’s NGO, Qiansuilan — made a schedule to better divide her attention among her six charges. She spent time playing with the 4- and 8-year-old, made sure they had snacks and toys, and helped them during meals and showers. She helped the other children, who were in their teens, disinfect their rooms and keep up with their school work. But most important was helping the children work through the pain of being away from their families while relatives were sick with COVID-19. Zhou reminded herself to be patient when the children got upset. “They were all a bit nervous the first day they arrived at the quarantine site,” she says. “An 8-year-old boy cried on his first night here. He said he wanted to go home, and he felt scared of sleeping alone. I made him a promise that I wouldn’t leave until he fell asleep.” Every day, Zhou kept her word.  Huang Minfang, a counselor based in the southern city of Guangzhou who specializes in juvenile psychology, tells Sixth Tone it is crucial under the current circumstances to tell children they haven’t been abandoned. “You should allow children to vent their feelings, to feel scared and hopeless,” she says. “You could tell the children their parents can’t visit because of disease, but that they love them, and that’s why they asked social workers to take care of them.” Another aspect of emotional support is how to deal with death. Yiyi would sometimes mention her late grandmother, who raised her before she fell ill. “She talked about how her grandma combed her hair and what games they played together,” Li recalls. “She didn’t know about her grandma’s death. Maybe her mother hadn’t told her about that.”  Xu, of Qiansuilan, says that the NGO will focus on helping children process the loss of family members, especially parents. “Taking care of them at the quarantine site is the first step of our project, and we are now revisiting the families to take care of their mental health,” Xu says, adding that the separation during the period of quarantine might also have left mental scars. Pan Aiqin, the mother of a 14-year-old boy, tells Sixth Tone she felt her son had changed slightly after coming out of quarantine. “He sticks closer to me and wants to talk to me all the time.” Li and Zhou finished their jobs as “temporary mothers,” as Chinese media had started calling them, in late March after the children’s parents one after another recovered and left the hospital. For many children, leaving the quarantine center was almost as emotional as moving in. “I waited until the morning of the day her mother was ready to pick her up before I told Yiyi she was going to meet her mother,” Li says. “She stared at me with her big, round eyes for a long time, and she didn’t say a word.”  Li stayed in touch with Yiyi and her family, who turned down Sixth Tone’s interview request, after the girl and both her parents moved back home. But when she noticed the family getting back to normal, she decided to stop calling. “After several video chats, I found that Yiyi’s family was getting better, so I stopped intervening,” Li says. Li thinks back fondly to her 24 days with Yiyi. “Sometimes, especially when my son is naughty,” she jokes, “I feel like it’s better after all to have a girl (like Yiyi).”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005559
Anarchy in Hubei: Wuhan’s Punk Bars Ride Out COVID-19,The Chinese city has long been famous for rebellious rock music. But the coronavirus crisis is threatening its most storied venues.,2020-04-24,"HUBEI, Central China — Fearless punks used to launch themselves from the second-floor balcony during shows at Wuhan’s most famous rock venue, trusting the writhing mass of sweaty limbs below to break their fall. But Vox — the livehouse known as the beating heart of China’s “Punk City” — hasn’t heard the roar of distorted guitars or screaming crowds for months. The main stage is empty, and the only figure in the mosh pit is the venue’s resident tabby cat, “Little Wang,” prowling quietly between the tables. On the black back wall, Vox’s motto is written in cursive white lettering: “Voice of Freedom, Voice of Youth.” The venue has been shut since late January, when the central city was suddenly locked down in an attempt to contain its coronavirus epidemic. Wuhan finally reopened to the rest of China to much fanfare 76 days later, and local stores, restaurants, and offices have been gradually resuming operations.  Yet live music bars like Vox and Prison Bar — another well-known haunt for the city’s punks — are still waiting for the green light to start hosting gigs once more. Vox has had to cancel or delay more than 50 shows since the lockdown, Zhu Ning, the venue’s founder, told Chinese web media Music Business in March. It also called off a two-day rock festival to celebrate its 15th anniversary, instead making do with a few livestreamed interviews and home-based band performances. The shutdowns are an existential threat to many livehouses. Despite earning practically nothing, they’re still obligated to continue paying rent, as well as their staff’s salaries and insurance plans. One promising new venue in the southern city of Shenzhen has already gone out of business.  “The virus is having a strong impact on this industry, especially these frontline venues,” says Li Ke, Vox’s manager, speaking to Sixth Tone at the venue. “We have high running costs … and yet we can’t open, so we don’t have a penny of income.” To cope, Vox has furloughed staff members on a reduced wage and negotiated a rent cut with its landlords, Zhu told Music Business. It’s also put out video content on platforms Weibo and Bilibili, though views are so far minimal. “We’re thinking of other ways to generate income,” says Li. “We can only hold on tight.” If Vox and Prison were to close, it would be a bitter blow to Wuhan’s music scene. The small venues played an outsized role in the city’s emergence as China’s punk capital, and both remain landmarks for fans of the genre. Punk in Wuhan began in the ’90s with a single musician: Wu Wei. A young bassist with a troubled background, Wu got hooked on Western rock music while living in Beijing, buying cassette tapes of The Clash and the Ramones on the black market.  Disillusioned with life in the capital, Wu returned to Wuhan with his friend and drummer — and eventual Vox founder — Zhu in 1996, resolving to develop a punk scene in their hometown. The pair formed the band SMZB — an abbreviation of the Chinese for “bread of life” — and played their first gig that December. Wuhan — a blue-collar city with a reputation for straight-talking and armed rebellion — proved to be fertile ground for punk. Soon, the city had a thriving stable of bands with colorful names, such as Play to Death, Angry Dog Eyes, Big Buns, Dogshit Sandwich, and Day of Chaos. Though some claim Chinese punk was born in Beijing, bands in Wuhan were known for staying faithful to the punk spirit of sticking it to the man and working collaboratively. SMZB refused to record love songs, instead belting out rhymes about social injustice, political corruption, and police brutality in a mixture of Chinese and broken English. As mostly cash-strapped youth, musicians from different bands worked together closely — living together to save money, sharing instruments and even band members, and creating posters and plastering them in local schools. Few local drummers could play in the fast punk style, so Zhu played for five different groups. After one night of concerts, he claimed he was so exhausted, he didn’t get out of bed for three days.  “Never Release My Fist,” a 2015 documentary about Wuhan’s punk underground, records the wild living and hardships endured by members of the subculture during the early days. Musicians jokingly describe the movement as feeling like a tightly knit mafia clan, with Wu Wei — whom they called Boss Wu — their villainous head. “People playing in bands in those days were crazy. They just wanted to do music; they couldn’t live without it,” says Li. “Those guys in that time were all very poor, so everyone lived together to save money.” Finding places to practice and play was a permanent headache, recalls Lin Wenhua, a vlogger and former member of the Wuhan punk band Red Spider. Clubs, bars, and karaoke parlors would refuse to let them back after they performed there, saying they were too noisy. Practice sessions often ended when the police arrived. In desperation, Red Spider resorted to practicing in a garage-like storefront in a park, and even a novelty Mongolian yurt — rehearsing there involved lugging amps and kit onto a ferry to cross the river.  “In the early days it wasn’t like now, where there’s everything you need, like practice rooms you can rent for money,” says Lin, who to this day goes by the name Spider. “Everything was done DIY … it was really tough.” Vox was born out of this need for a permanent base for Wuhan’s punks to perform. Zhu, who had left SMZB after the band moved to Beijing, created the Vox brand in 2000 with the aim of creating a safe haven for music. Its first location was in an old missionary church in 2002 — which was ideal, because it was “cool” and “extremely cheap” to rent, according to Li. Cool as it was, though, the venue was poorly run and shut down within six months.  In 2005 — after Zhu returned from touring in the United States, where he learned more about how to professionally run a livehouse — he set up the second incarnation of Vox, which mainly operated as a bar. In 2007, it relocated to its third and final location. Li, who started working at Vox part time around this time, says it was the first American-style bar in the area. It was soon followed by Prison Bar, which Wu founded after returning to Wuhan from Beijing in 2009. Both venues went on to acquire something approaching legendary status in Wuhan, pulling in a colorful crowd of expats, musicians, aging punks, and misfits. Prison even became the subject of an SZMB song. “When the show was over (in Vox), a huge amount of people would come in to drink beer,” says Li. “In those days, it was hot, busy, and pretty chaotic.” Wuhan is a university city with a plentiful supply of young artists, and hundreds of bands played at Vox over the years. They often came and went, however, without a single recording to their name, says Li. To immortalize the city’s ephemeral music scene, Vox began to record annual live compilation albums called “Voice of Wuhan.” In 2015, Vox started its own record label, Wild Records, which is now an independent business entity with five bands signed to it. It also opened two new livehouse branches in the central city of Changsha and the southwestern Chongqing, in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  The punk movement that originally put Wuhan music on the map has since all but burned out, with Vox standing as the final permanent relic to that age. Out of the early cohort of bands, only SMZB remains. “Wuhan punk was very famous at the time, but there was actually just one wave of bands,” says Li. “Now, everything is more popular than punk … the most popular are Taiwanese bands: representatives of the petty bourgeoisie.” Punk declined in Wuhan as society changed, Li suggests. Whereas the early punk musicians were poor and angry, today’s young people are not. Lin describes them as “gentler” and “more patriotic.” They’re also more interested in writing hits, getting fame online, and making money, Li adds. “Times have changed,” says Li. “Young people live much better than they used to … They just think, ‘how can I pursue a comfortable life?’” The old bands broke up as they aged and work and family pressures mounted. Newer musicians craved more complex sounds, shunning the basic chord structures and four-beat rhythms of punk.  Former punk rocker Xu Bo, who played with Lin in Red Spider in the early 2000s, says he moved on to emo later that decade. In recent years, he’s strayed even further from his punk roots, founding the math rock band Chinese Football — presently one of Wuhan’s most famous acts — which is signed under the Vox-associated Wild Records. If the punk scene he used to play in was rooted in hot-blooded rebellion, Xu says he’s a believer in a more introspective approach to change — starting from yourself, from within. “This might differ from bands of that generation, who were all about resistance,” he tells Sixth Tone.  Wuhan’s reputation as a “punk city” is now mostly a legend, according to Li. Commentators love to draw a link between punk and Wuhan’s local culture, with its harsh dialect, brusque manners, and history of revolution — from the 1911 uprising that toppled China’s last emperor, to the vicious infighting during the decadelong Cultural Revolution. In true punk style, however, Li scoffs at the idea there’s a real connection with the city’s music scene. “Does this have anything to do with it? It’s a forced analogy,” he says. But Xu still sees glimpses of the old punk spirit in how Wuhan has responded to the COVID-19 crisis. From the fearless “aunties” who continue to congregate and dance on the streets, to the public spiritedness shown by many locals, punk’s values of self-organization and fierce loyalty are alive and well. Xu says he learned this spirit during his early days at Vox, when everyone pooled their efforts to help out with events, and he’d help to clean up after they were done. “Everyone might have their own understanding of what punk is. But what I admire is the spirit of DIY in punk — do what you can do,” says Xu. “To this day, this kind of thing has left a deep impression on me, even to my bones.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005546
Snapshots of a Wuhan ICU,Photos show what life was like for the medical workers tasked with treating the city’s most severe COVID-19 cases.,2020-04-24,"On April 11, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital’s intensive care unit discharged its last COVID-19 patient. For the first time since Jan. 3, the facility was free of the coronavirus. A little less than three months ago, Wuhan’s medical system was on the brink of collapse. By the time local health officials declared a state of emergency in late January, thousands of residents of this centrally located city at the heart of China’s COVID-19 outbreak — including many experienced doctors and nurses — were already sick and in desperate need of care. The city eventually responded by segregating the sick according to their condition: Those with mild symptoms were quarantined for observation in hotels, university dorms, or fangcang shelter hospitals, while those in more serious condition were sent to pop-up hospitals or the city’s preexisting medical facilities. Many of the worst cases wound up at ICUs like the one at Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. With so many medical workers sick or needed elsewhere, the ICU was down to 25% of its normal staffing levels. Over the course of 100 days, this skeleton crew treated a total of 81 severely ill coronavirus patients. At any given second, a patient might experience lung failure, go into shock, or face other life-threatening complications, leaving staff to snatch moments of peace wherever they could. Beginning in March, I documented their experiences. The resulting photos offer a small window into the lives of the ordinary people who were tasked with saving a city.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005551
"Remdesivir Ineffective in Treating COVID-19, Study Suggests","The WHO posted, then deleted, a report summary indicating that patients in Wuhan who received the experimental drug had worse outcomes than those given placebos.",2020-04-24,"Remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug believed to have alleviated COVID-19 symptoms in some people, did not keep patients alive in a clinical trial conducted in China. The trial result was posted online by the World Health Organization but quickly deleted, biomedical news site STAT reported Thursday. “A draft manuscript was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed,” WHO spokesperson Daniela Bagozzi told STAT. “The manuscript is now undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments on it.” The human trial was led by doctors from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing and took place in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the novel coronavirus was first detected. Of the 237 patients enrolled, 157 in the experimental group received remdesivir, while 79 in the control group received sugar pills. According to a screenshot included in STAT’s report, the trial found that patients who received sugar pills recovered more quickly over the 28-day study period than those who received remdesivir. The death rates for the two groups were comparable, and data suggests that a small discrepancy — 13.9% for the experimental group versus 12.8% for the control group — could have been due to chance. In addition, more patients who received the drug had adverse side effects compared with the control group, and 18 patients had to stop receiving remdesivir entirely because of their reactions. “In this study of hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 that was terminated prematurely, remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits,” the researchers wrote, according to STAT’s screenshot. The trial had failed to recruit its target number of patients. Records show that the researchers had hoped to enroll 453 patients but ended up with only 237 due to a lack of available subjects, according to the trial’s registration. Hours after STAT published its exposé, Gilead Sciences, remdesivir’s California-based manufacturer, said the WHO report “included inappropriate characterizations,” citing the study’s premature termination due to low enrollment. “As such, the study results are inconclusive, though trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir,” the company’s chief medical officer Merdad Parsey said in the statement. While no such benefits were evident from the screenshot included in STAT’s article, a previous study on 61 severely ill COVID-19 patients from around the world who were given the drug pointed to remdesivir’s potential for improving symptoms. However, that study was not a randomized, controlled trial. Another remdesivir trial in Wuhan led by the same research group on patients with mild or moderate symptoms has also suspended its recruitment due to a shortage of available patients. But several other human trials for remdesivir are underway outside China, including one in the U.S. overseen by the National Institutes of Health. The NIH trial result is expected to be released by May, according to Gilead. Lu Hongzhou, a leading virologist at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, told Sixth Tone that the Wuhan trial’s result is not conclusive. “For severe and late-stage COVID-19 patients, killing the virus with drugs shouldn’t be the main goal of therapy,” Lu said, adding that treating life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory and organ failure should be the main focus for such patients. “Don’t give up on remdesivir yet — we just need more data and studies,” Lu said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005549
Redesigning Robocop for a Pandemic,"The head of a robotics company explains how his firm repurposed its line of “patrol robots” for disease prevention, and what the outbreak means for the industry as a whole.",2020-04-23,"This article is part of an ongoing series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. “Please wear a mask, pay attention to personal hygiene, and avoid crowded places. If you feel unwell, seek medical assistance promptly.” Such warnings have become an all-too-familiar refrain in recent months. They’re broadcast over loudspeakers, sent through text messages, and plastered on billboards. But if you’ve recently visited any of a handful of airports, high-speed rail stations, shopping malls, hospitals, or residential communities around China, you may have heard it emanating from a very unfamiliar place: a patrol robot. My company released a line of these machines in the first half of 2016, well before this pandemic. Prior to January of this year, they were generally used to complete industrial tasks considered dangerous for humans, such as detecting leaks in nuclear power plants or phosphine gas residue after granary fumigations. But after the COVID-19 outbreak in the central city of Wuhan spread nationwide, my team held an emergency meeting to see if there was any way we could help. Within a few days, we came up with a plan to upgrade our robots to make them better suited for infectious disease control work. The new “COVID-19 models” were ready to manufacture the moment we resumed work on Feb. 3. A week later, they were on the front lines of the epidemic. Of course, we made them capable of far more than just wandering about, bleating out warnings. In addition to their five high-definition cameras, they can measure the body temperature of 10 people at once, identify whether pedestrians are wearing masks, and even issue friendly reminders to those who aren’t. The coronavirus’ rapid spread has given new impetus to China’s robotics industry. Over the past four months, hospitals have used robots to screen visitors’ temperatures, distribute food to patients in isolation wards, and sterilize high-risk areas such as intensive care units and operating rooms. Outside the medical sector, our campaign for social distancing has sparked a rise in “zero contact” business models, including unmanned shops and automated delivery services.  This trend is unlikely to disappear once COVID-19 is under control. As China’s demographic dividend dwindles, labor costs rise, and machinery gets cheaper, the widespread adoption of automation and robotics is merely a matter of time. Globally, China is neither a clear-cut leader nor a laggard in the field. In 2019, the global robotics market was valued at $29.4 billion, and grew by an average of 12.3% annually between 2014 and 2019. The Chinese robotics market, which grew by about 21% per year during that span, finished the five-year stretch accounting for a little less than one-third that sum. If that growth is to continue, however, we need a clear understanding of our strengths and weaknesses as an industry. In terms of the former, the Chinese government is vigorously promoting and investing in technological development, including artificial intelligence, 5G, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data. This focus on what officials have termed “new infrastructure” will also help stimulate the rapid growth of robotics. Take 5G, for example. 5G-capable robots are already in use in many areas, and as the networking technology develops, its high bandwidth and low latency will allow more of the processing to be conducted in the cloud, meaning the robots themselves will require less internal processing power. This will lower costs while increasing stability.  Second, by virtue of being based in the so-called world’s factory, Chinese robotics firms have access to a secure and relatively complete manufacturing chain. Robots are complex creations, requiring high levels of both software and hardware expertise. This takes time to accumulate, but there are signs that the domestic industry is moving up the value chain. The country’s increasingly sophisticated manufacturers now boast the ability to produce almost every component used in our devices, with the exception of a few hardware items, such as central processing units. At a time when pandemic-related travel restrictions have upended global supply chains, our ability to keep production lines running is proof of how important this advantage can be. We have taken steps toward localizing the production of radars, controllers, and motors with an eye toward further reducing our overall manufacturing costs. Finally, robots are already being used in a wide range of places in China, from airports to government offices. This is generating a tremendous amount of data which can be used to drive further technological evolution and train algorithms. Despite these advantages, however, the Chinese robotics industry still faces critical problems when it comes to talent recruitment, research, patents, and access to capital. Although many schools have established robotics majors, the curricula remain overly broad, and insufficient to meet the needs of industry players. Meanwhile, companies often shy away from basic theoretical research, in part because of the costs involved and the amount of time it takes to see results. The government needs to step up and help plug this gap, whether through academic or research and development funding.  Then there is the lack of patents owned by Chinese firms, and, equally important, the industry’s poor understanding of other countries’ patent regimes. China’s robotics industry only began applying for patents in the 1990s. Not only did this put the country behind the rest of the world, China’s technology also paled in comparison. If Chinese companies want to export their products, they need a basic understanding of importing countries’ patent rules, but there is currently no advisory body capable of helping firms manage this challenge. Lastly, there’s access to capital. Starting a robotics company without funding for at least the first five years is risky. But that’s a tough bar to clear when a firm can blow through anywhere from 60 million to over 1 billion yuan a year ($8.5 million to $141 million). Of the many startups that rushed into the nascent patrol robot sector in 2018, for example, very few remain today. Luckily, the outstanding performance and widespread application of robots during the ongoing pandemic appears to have attracted the attention of investors — a slim silver lining during this dark time. As the underlying technology improves and the market continues to grow, I believe we will start to see more robots in restaurants, schools, and in our own homes. The future is bright, and startups have been presented with a golden opportunity to speed up the industry’s development. We should seize it.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005531
Wuhan’s Lockdown Is Over. Its Economic Pain Is Just Beginning.,"Weeks after the city eased its virus-control policies, thousands of businesses remain shuttered. Many may never restart production.",2020-04-23,"HUBEI, Central China — It has now been two weeks since Wuhan lifted its lockdown, marking a new stage in its recovery from a coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 4,000 people. But inside the city’s sprawling technology parks, it’s clear Wuhan’s economic wounds will take much longer to heal. Before the pandemic, the city’s “Optics Valley” — also known as Wuhan East Lake Hi-Tech Development Zone — was among China’s most dynamic innovation hubs, home to research centers for tech giants including Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as thousands of startups. When Sixth Tone visits April 13, however, the zone is eerily quiet. On an asphalt square outside a large office building, around 20 people are lined up in 1 meter intervals, waiting to be tested for COVID-19 — a requirement for anyone returning to work in the business zone. One by one, the workers approach a table, where medical workers in full hazmat suits take swabs of their mouths and blood samples from their fingers. Wang Feng, a 50-something waiting in line, tells Sixth Tone his company will inform its staff of their test results a few days later via social app WeChat.  Most businesses in Optics Valley have yet to reopen. Of the more than 100,000 firms registered here, only 13,000 had resumed operations as of April 12, the business zone’s administrative committee told Sixth Tone in a written statement. The prolonged shutdowns threaten to cause deep and lasting harm to the central city’s economy. Established in 1988, Optics Valley has been essential to Wuhan’s drive to shed its reputation as “China’s Detroit” — named for its auto plants and heavy industry — and reinvent itself as a gleaming Silicon Valley-style haven for high-tech companies. The park has become a popular base for biomedicine and high-end equipment companies in recent years. It’s also a hub for optoelectronics — the research and manufacture of optical fibers and display panels — leading to its nickname. In 2018, firms in the zone generated combined revenues of 1.2 trillion yuan (then roughly $186 billion).  Now, however, many of these companies are finding themselves in dire straits. Cash flow problems are mounting, and clients are moving their business elsewhere in China, where the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been less severe. According to Luo Zhi, director of Wuhan University’s New Private Enterprise Economy Research Center, the city’s small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are under particularly severe pressure. “We’re two months behind the neighboring provinces, which resumed work in February,” says Luo. “A major problem now is that many Wuhan companies lost their orders to companies in other regions.” Sunshine Optoelectronics, an Optics Valley-based firm that produces OLED materials for display panel makers, resumed production March 23, but the company is still dealing with orders received in January. “We have a stack of production orders received before the pandemic that need to be processed as soon as possible,” Dai Chun, the company’s head of production, tells Sixth Tone. “Companies in places like (the southern city of) Guangzhou restarted operations as early as February, and we’ve been held up for a long time. The demand is urgent.” Mu Guangyuan, founder and CEO of Sunshine, says several clients have canceled orders due to the delays. He’s also been forced to push back plans to open a second production base in the nearby city of Yidu, he adds.  “A four-month absence from the industrial chain has had a great impact on our position (in the market),” says Mu. “Our company is currently in a stage of rapid development, and demand for our products is gradually rising. But this pandemic has slowed down the entire process and made panel manufacturers more conservative.” The company’s financial situation, meanwhile, is deteriorating. In line with a government policy, Sunshine has avoided layoffs and continued to pay its staff their full salaries throughout the crisis. “Our fixed costs remain, while the number of orders is decreasing,” says Mu. Large numbers of businesses in Wuhan are experiencing severe financial difficulties, according to Luo. The problem is particularly acute for smaller firms, which often struggle to access financing in China. “The funding problem for SMEs is very urgent,” says Luo. “They don’t have capital flow.” In a statement, Optics Valley acknowledged that SMEs have been impacted by the pandemic and face “practical problems.” The park said the high-tech zone plans to grant 130 million yuan of subsidies to support around 1,000 high-tech companies in Wuhan.  The subsidies’ impact, however, is likely to be limited. If the money was divided equally, the 130,000 yuan allocated would cover less than a week of Sunshine’s operating costs, according to Mu. For Luo, the Chinese government should consider going further and giving Wuhan’s firms a “blood transfusion” — an emergency bailout — to prevent companies from folding. The Wuhan authorities would struggle to finance such a move, as their own finances are strained, she adds. The city’s fiscal revenues were down over 30% from the same period last year in January and February. On April 19, Li Qiang, deputy mayor of Wuhan, announced the city would create a bailout fund of 40 billion yuan to support local SMEs through the crisis.  “The best approach now is to keep companies alive, so that everything can return to its original state after the pandemic,” says Luo. “If you don’t, the companies will collapse and the industry chain will be gone.” The situation for Wuhan’s larger high-tech firms is less critical, but many are dealing with unprecedented challenges due to the economic turbulence unleashed by the pandemic. Wuhan Huazhong Numerical Control, a listed company that manufactures numerical control systems and industrial robots, resumed production in March and now has 96% of its employees back at work, the company’s CEO, Tian Maosheng, tells Sixth Tone. During the lockdown in Wuhan, Huazhong relied on its facility in the southern Guangdong province — which was able to reopen in February — to continue production, according to Tian. The company was even able to keep one production line in Wuhan open for producing infrared temperature monitoring systems, as the coronavirus crisis caused an unexpected surge in demand for temperature sensors. But the firm is still highly concerned about the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, which are already impacting demand for Huazhong’s main product lines, Tian says. “The pandemic is severely affecting market demand … this is happening throughout the country and throughout the world,” the 40-year-old says. “Many companies may not be able to survive this crisis.”  Huazhong is focusing on seizing new opportunities that have come up during the crisis. According to Tian, the firm expects demand for industrial robots to rise in the wake of the pandemic and for temperature monitoring systems to remain popular as countries invest more in public health infrastructure. The situation in the global economy, however, is tempering any optimism among Wuhan’s firms. Based in central China, most companies’ immediate clients are other domestic firms, but many of them are still tied into global supply chains, says Ye Xueping, director of the Economic Research Institute at the Hubei Academy of Social Sciences. “Regarding the impact of the pandemic on global supply and demand, I think the most violent storm hasn’t yet arrived,” says Tian. “So, we need to be more careful and prudent.” Mu, of OLED materials maker Sunshine, shares this concern. If a global recession hits, it could impact the company’s business in unpredictable ways, he suggests. “We’re still waiting to see whether the global market can recover after June,” says Mu. “If it doesn’t, the pressure will be passed along the entire value chain … The side effects (of the COVID-19 crisis) are very serious. It could reconfigure the industrial chain.”  Huazhong is preparing for a global downturn by stocking up on essential parts — such as certain microchips used in its numerical control systems — that are only made abroad. “We’re worried that the goods might not be supplied (in the future) due to the influence of the pandemic,” says Tian. “That would be tough.” For Tian, the greatest fear of all is that the pandemic would fuel a growing wave of de-globalization, with countries reducing their reliance on Chinese suppliers and buyers in strategic industries.  “If globalization is truly reversed and everyone is taking care of their own business, our future is unclear,” says Tian. Ye, however, expects de-globalization to be limited, as political concerns may be overridden by the needs of the market. Processing and manufacturing firms value the completeness of China’s supply chains, as well as its labor force and market. “It’s not so easy to move out,” he says. Market advantages should also help Wuhan recover in the long run, according to Li Jianbin, professor of management at Wuhan’s Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Although the pandemic has been the ultimate “black swan” event, the city still has a lot to offer companies, he says. “Wuhan still has advantages regarding geography, talent, cost, and logistics,” says Li. “That’s why many companies choose to invest here.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005529
"COVID-19 Virus Likely Came From Animals in China, WHO Says","The global health body appears to reject conspiracy theories that the novel coronavirus came from either a bioweapons lab in the U.S. or an infectious diseases lab in Wuhan, where the first infections were detected.",2020-04-22,"The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is likely to have originated in wild animals in China rather than in a laboratory, according to the World Health Organization. “All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,” Reuters cited Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the WHO, as saying at a Tuesday news briefing. “It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.” Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump said “there is a lot of investigation going on” into whether the novel coronavirus may have come from a laboratory in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus was first detected, adding that such a theory “seems to make sense.” However, international public health authorities — including Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the U.S.’s top infectious disease experts — have rejected this possible origin story as a fringe theory supported by little or no evidence. On Monday, China’s foreign ministry responded to Trump’s remarks, calling them subjective and lacking in scientific evidence. Spokesman Geng Shuang added that where the coronavirus comes from is a scientific question and should not be politicalized. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been hotly debated in the months since the outbreak was first reported in China. In particular, the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a research institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences that houses the country’s only Biosafety Level 4 lab for studying highly infectious diseases — has been accused of leaking the virus, possibly through staff selling test animals at Wuhan’s South China Seafood Wholesale Market to make some extra cash. Netizens and fringe news sites have pointed to a 2015 paper by Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus specialist at the institute, that details how Shi and her team isolated a new coronavirus found in native populations of horseshoe bats, as apparent evidence for their claims. Shortly after the rumors surfaced in early February, Shi dismissed them as the work of “conspiracy theorists who don’t believe in science” in an interview with financial outlet Caixin. “I swear on my life that this has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she posted on her personal account on social app WeChat. On Saturday, the BSL4 lab’s director, Yuan Zhiming, also said there was “absolutely no way” the COVID-19 virus could have originated at the institute. Nevertheless, the great origin debate has raged on in the online sphere. In mid-March, a famous Chinese vlogger was bullied by nationalist netizens for apologizing on behalf of her country after the virus had begun to spread around the globe. Her critics argued that she had nothing to be sorry for, as the origin of the coronavirus had not been confirmed. Meanwhile, fake news and disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and its possible origin in the U.S have been widely shared on WeChat and Weibo — China’s dominant social media platforms — to the point that content moderators have been spurred to action. Though the source of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed, many scientists believe the virus came to humans from bats — the presumptive reservoir host — via an as-yet-unknown intermediate host that may have been handled and sold at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the first cases were traced. To reduce the risk of further animal-to-human diseases, China in late January announced a blanket ban on the domestic wildlife trade. Last week, President Trump said that the U.S. — by far the world’s largest donor to the WHO — would defund the global health body while “a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.” His remarks prompted swift criticism from China and the international community, with foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urging the U.S. to “fulfill its responsibilities and obligations” to support the WHO.  infected with SARS-CoV-2 viruses (yellow), isolated from a patient’s sample.

‘A 600-Person Dormitory’: Life Inside a Wuhan ‘Fangcang’ Hospital,A Wuhan resident describes her experience inside the ‘parallel universe’ of a COVID-19 shelter hospital.,2020-04-22,"Editor’s note: Yi Bei is a graphic designer based in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. She spent over two weeks in a temporary “fangcang” shelter hospital, after she and her parents contracted the coronavirus. Her parents were treated at separate facilities. On March 24, I went to donate plasma at a health center in my hometown of Wuhan. It was the first time I’d seen the outside world for nearly two months. Since my COVID-19 diagnosis in early February, I’d been cooped up in enclosed spaces: first in a hospital, then in a fangcang — a temporary shelter hospital for patients with mild symptoms — and finally in a rehabilitation center. But sitting in the back of a car driving to the clinic, with the windows rolled down and music blaring, those weeks of confinement started to seem like a strange dream. If it wasn’t for the fact that the driver was dressed head-to-toe in protective clothing, I could easily have forgotten that the epidemic had ever happened. Even now, my journey from infection to recovery feels surreal. It’s like I descended into a parallel world in which the coronavirus outbreak was located, only to reemerge back into the Wuhan I recognized.   Entering the Fangcang In January, I went to a pop concert at Wuhan Sports Center, a 13,000-seat arena in the center of the city. At the time, I never imagined that just weeks later I’d be back, but this time as a patient — and that the stadium would be transformed into a giant shelter hospital. I was a late entrant to the fangcang. By the time I arrived, the center was fully up and running, and the beds were more or less full. The basketball court had been divided into six zones, each housing around 100 people. There were also 300 medical workers, mostly nurses. Life in the shelter hospital could be monotonous, punctuated only by mealtimes and an endless series of health checks. Nurses took my temperature in the morning, afternoon, and before bed. In between, they checked my blood oxygen and heart rate, as well as looking at older patients’ blood pressure. The doctors did the rounds twice a day, in the mornings and evenings. Occasionally, the nurses would lead everyone through a series of exercises.  The rest of the time, we were basically left to our own devices. Outside the stadium, staff fenced off a large area in which people could move around. Some patients stayed in bed all day, while others would go out and enjoy the sun. Many of us would get together and chat for hours to pass the time.  Canteens and Karaoke Living in the fangcang was a very strange experience: It often felt like we were in a huge dormitory for 600 people. First, there was the issue of eating. In the beginning, there were problems with food hoarding. People close to the entrance got to take their meals first, and some men would grab large portions. Sometimes, people near the back of the line were left with nothing at all. Later, the staff decided to deliver the meals directly to our beds. I’d occasionally wake up in the morning and find my breakfast already waiting for me.  I didn’t sleep well in the shelter hospital. The lights were left on 24 hours a day. Fortunately, the hospital eventually gave all of us eye masks to help us rest. But because my bed was near the entrance, people were constantly walking back and forth from the bathroom in the middle of the night. Snoring was also an issue. On the first day, I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown, it was so loud. I hoped to get some earplugs, too — sadly, that never happened. There weren’t any showers in the fangcang, but they provided fresh water for us to wash our hair and feet. A lot of people would sit on stools outside and soak their feet. People did this at all hours, every day.  To keep us entertained, the staff organized a hospital concert one day. Everyone was excited and took turns singing. The microphone was so loud, their voices traveled all over the fangcang. I had to go outside just to video chat with my parents. Other times, the nurses’ station played some light music. Although there were many people in the hospital, no one talked loudly and it was often very quiet. When the music was playing, it felt ethereal, the sound lingering long after the song had finished. Unlikely Friendships After days spent living in such close proximity, the patients developed an unexpected camaraderie. When I first entered the fangcang, my parents were both hospitalized with more serious symptoms, and I didn’t really want to talk to anyone. At that time, no one was chatting much. None of us even knew whether our fellow patients’ situations were more miserable than our own, but there were few topics of conversation other than the pandemic. I chose to close myself off and stayed in bed. But later, my parents got better, and I loosened up a bit and started going outside for some fresh air. After a few days, some patients invited me to go out with them.  One in the group was a woman in her 30s. For days, I’d been listening to her crying on the phone as she talked with local community workers. Her mother wasn’t capable of taking care of herself, but she also needed to be quarantined, so the family was facing a dilemma. Another lady also cried every day. Her whole family was infected, and she didn’t know what to do about her two children. At the time, I didn’t know what to say to the pair. But when they took the initiative and opened up to me while we were outside, I realized that it was OK to talk about these things. Later, our small group slowly grew from three to five or six people. Everyone began to chat together most of the day, stopping only to eat and sleep, like a group of schoolchildren. We spent a lot of time discussing CT scans, trying to pinpoint what was wrong in the image.  After getting acquainted, we started talking about our lives outside the hospital, our careers and interests. I was probably the youngest in the group. Most were in their 30s or 40s, and one woman was in her 50s. Later, we started chatting about everything, and age didn’t matter. We ended up setting up a group chat on social app WeChat, and we’re still in contact every day. After being discharged from the fangcang, we were sent to different rehabilitation and quarantine centers. Now, we’re all back home, but we still share updates on our health, follow-up rehab, assessments, and things like that. The others have also talked about the discrimination they’ve encountered since recovering. Although I haven’t experienced anything like that myself, I comfort them when they mention it.  A New Community Another thing that struck me about the shelter hospital was the amount of care everyone gave to the elderly. Wuhan’s fangcang were only supposed to accommodate mildly ill patients up to the age of 65. But several people over the age limit were there alongside us. In the bed next to mine was an elderly woman from the eastern Shandong province, who had been living in Wuhan for over 30 years. She spoke a dialect that few in the hospital could understand, and she was pretty unhappy. Her husband, son, grandson, and granddaughter were all hospitalized with COVID-19. Meanwhile, she had preexisting health conditions including hypertension, which often gave her insomnia and headaches during the night. The nurses, however, took special care of the woman, giving her medication for hypertension and bringing her food and other daily necessities. The attending physician in our area also contacted the patient’s daughter privately and donated several thousand yuan to them after learning about the family’s financial situation.  The doctor wanted to make another donation, but the daughter politely refused, feeling that the medical workers had already given her mother great care. Most of the staff in the fangcang came from Jiangsu, another eastern province. One of the hospital volunteers and I have agreed to visit Jiangsu when the pandemic is over, so we can thank them in person. There was also a 77-year-old man with dementia, whose wife had been sent to an isolation ward elsewhere. Sometimes, he would wander around the hospital looking for her. Everywhere the man went, someone would take care of him. They’d ask, “Where are you going, uncle?” in the Wuhan dialect, and give him water to wash his face. One nice young man noticed he hadn’t gone to the bathroom in several days. So, we coaxed the elderly man into drinking yogurt and eating bananas, saving our yogurts for him every day.  Another nice patient asked the man about his situation at home, during one of his lucid periods. She asked around and found a way to contact his family. It turned out the man had two sons — the eldest was in a hospital, but the younger son’s family was fine. The woman contacted the younger son’s family via WeChat. After calling once to say thanks for taking care of the elderly man, however, the family didn’t bother checking up on him after that. One day, the man suddenly became lucid and began to cry, saying that he wanted to see his wife. Again, the warmhearted woman made some calls, and with the help of some young people in the quarantine facility where his partner was staying, the couple were reunited via video chat. We all worried who would take care of the man after we left the hospital.  The Code Turns Green After being discharged from the fangcang, I was quarantined in a rehabilitation ward for another two weeks before returning home. By this time, my mother was also out of the hospital and was self-isolating at home. We stayed in separate bedrooms, wearing masks whenever we emerged. We also ate meals alone. Now, the travel restrictions in Wuhan have been eased, and the health code on my phone has finally turned green. It remains difficult to enter neighborhoods — after all, asymptomatic people aren’t being fully screened, and people still need to be on guard — but people are much less afraid.  The epidemic in China was actually nothing like I expected. At first, I thought it would disappear overnight, as SARS did in 2003. A friend and I fantasized that, at the end, we’d hug and cry in the streets. My friend’s family was infected as well, so we were supporting each other through this difficult time. A few days after my first plasma donation, I received a call from the blood center’s staff. They informed me that my plasma had a very high level of antibodies and could be used to help three severely ill patients. So, on the day that Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted, I went back to the clinic and made another donation, before the antibodies in my blood faded away.

Jiangxi Hospital Gives Frontline Medics Generous Cash Rewards,"While some private hospitals have the financial resources to compensate staff returning from Hubei, public hospital workers say they’ve yet to receive their promised government subsidies.",2020-04-21,"A private hospital in eastern China’s Jiangxi province is winning praise after offering generous monetary rewards to three of its health care workers who served on the front lines in the country’s fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. Ganxi Cancer Hospital in the city of Pingxiang awarded an auspicious 86,666 yuan ($12,200) each to one ICU doctor and two nurses who had returned from a two-month assignment in the hard-hit central province of Hubei, Beijing Youth Daily reported Monday. The medical workers were also offered two weeks of paid leave, as well as a year’s worth of free meals at the hospital’s cafeteria for them and their family members. “This is the first time the hospital has issued such a large amount of cash,” a staff member at Ganxi Cancer Hospital told the outlet. “(It’s) mainly to commend the spirit of the medical staff who assisted in Hubei.” Beginning in January, over 42,000 medical workers from across China were dispatched to Hubei to support the province’s overburdened public health facilities during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. The last medical assistance team consisting of 180 health care workers from the elite Peking Union Medical College Hospital left Wuhan on Wednesday. Apart from Ganxi Cancer Hospital, a private hospital in the northeastern Liaoning province has also awarded a total of 1 million yuan to four of its medical workers who were sent to Wuhan, according to domestic media.  To better compensate hospital staff involved in combating the pandemic, China’s central government in February pledged that all frontline medical workers would be entitled to daily allowances of 200 to 300 yuan. However, nearly a month later, many medical workers were saying they had not received the promised funds. While some private hospitals like the one in Jiangxi have the financial resources to generously reward their medical staff, public hospital workers say it’s not realistic to expect similarly grand gestures from their institutions. “It’s not really possible for public hospitals to do that,” Ye Xin, a staff member with the publicity department of Jiangxi Pingxiang People’s Hospital, told Sixth Tone, referring to the rewards disbursed by Ganxi Cancer Hospital. While China’s public hospitals are partially subsidized by the state, they must largely fend for themselves when it comes to making enough money to keep their doors open. As a result, they’re less likely to be able to offer surplus funds or additional benefits to staff. In fact, the long hours and low wages common in China’s public health system are driving many medical professionals to private hospitals, or out of the profession entirely. “We will certainly disburse the government subsidies (to the frontline medics) first, then determine the next steps depending on our finances,” said Ye, adding that Jiangxi Pingxiang People’s Hospital is also planning to reward its staff. At designated facilities for receiving and treating COVID-19 patients in Wuhan — the city where China’s coronavirus cases were most concentrated — half a dozen medical workers including doctors and nurses told Sixth Tone that they have not received any subsidies after working almost nonstop for over three months. Zhou Qing, an ICU doctor at one such hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told Sixth Tone last week that she had been living off a base salary for the previous two months, as her workplace could not generate income from other operations and procedures, which were effectively suspended during the pandemic. The hospital was also paying upfront to treat its COVID-19 patients and waiting to be reimbursed by government medical insurance later, creating a heavy financial burden. “The hospital has no income, as we weren’t receiving other patients (apart from those with COVID-19),” said Zhou. “According to national policy, medical insurance covers all (coronavirus) treatment fees. As for the pay upfront part, it is said that the country will cover the rest, though it has not yet disbursed those funds.” Treating one COVID-19 patient costs around 21,500 yuan on average, while critically ill patients may require treatment worth 150,000 yuan or more. And although Chinese authorities have promised that treatment for both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients will be “free for all,” by April 6 medical insurance had only covered treatment fees for 66.6% of coronavirus patients nationwide, amounting to over 1 billion yuan, leaving hospitals on the hook for the bills of the remaining one-third, at least for now. Chen Yongfeng, a staff member in Zhongnan Hospital’s medical affairs department, confirmed to Sixth Tone on Tuesday that the hospital has not yet disbursed state subsidies to frontline medical workers due to unspecified “difficulties.” “We have been calculating (the subsidies) but have not issued them,” Chen said. He added that while the subsidies were not yet “all in place,” he expected the hospital will be able to disburse them “in the near future.” Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Chinese government mandated that hospitals should treat patients first and settle bills later, requiring local governments to manage any deficits in the meantime. However, some overburdened hospitals reportedly faced financial crises after prepaying tens of thousands of yuan in treatment costs and then failing to receive government subsidies or payments from patients in a timely manner.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005527
"Facing New Clusters, NE China Ramps Up COVID-19 Containment","At least one province is offering bounties to residents who report suspected coronavirus cases, as well as reprimanding officials and hospital staff who fail to control local outbreaks.",2020-04-20,"Authorities in China’s northeastern Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces are implementing additional measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus amid a sustained surge in newly reported local cases.  On Sunday, the outbreak control and prevention command center in Heilongjiang’s Suifenhe City announced bounties of up to 3,000 yuan ($420) for residents offering tips to authorities about people who may have lied about their health conditions, travel histories, or contact with diagnosed patients. Previously, people who “captured” and turned in illicit migrants crossing over from Russia were offered 5,000 yuan bounties, while any “valid tips” were rewarded with 3,000 yuan. Since early April, the city of 70,000 and its home province of Heilongjiang have been on alert after Chinese nationals returning from Russia caused a spike in imported coronavirus cases. Suifenhe has since declared an effective lockdown, suspending all public gatherings, closing its land border, and requiring residents to remain indoors. On Monday, the provincial health commission in Heilongjiang reported another four imported infections, all among Chinese nationals returning from Russia. As of Sunday, the province had 41 confirmed cases — 39 in the capital city of Harbin and two in the city of Mudanjiang — as well as 26 asymptomatic cases. The rising number of cases in Heilongjiang has also worried neighboring Jilin province. Authorities in Jilin’s capital of Changchun said Sunday that travelers from Harbin and Mudanjiang must undergo 14 days’ quarantine at home or in a government-designated facility, and take three nucleic acid tests at their own expense to determine if they are infected with the coronavirus. Authorities in Harbin have also intensified containment efforts after the city reported four new confirmed cases and 11 asymptomatic infections on Wednesday. Provincial officials have reprimanded the city’s COVID-19 control and prevention task force for failing to control the outbreak. Heilongjiang’s party secretary Zhang Qingwei said Thursday that a supervisory team would be set up to guide Harbin’s disease control and prevention work. The announcement came a day after the city’s health commission appointed a new director. Meanwhile, Heilongjiang’s discipline inspection commission said that 18 people in Harbin, including the city’s deputy mayor, had been held accountable for lax anti-outbreak control efforts. Of the 18 people, 13 were from the city’s three hospitals, and included hospital heads and doctors. According to domestic media, one 87-year-old patient who was admitted to Harbin Second Hospital and transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University infected more than 30 people at the two facilities.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005521
How the COVID-19 Pandemic Is Revitalizing Everyday Creativity,"With the world in varying stages of lockdown, people are redefining their relationships to art.",2020-04-20,"In the spectral silence of a deserted Siena, Tuscany, a man leans out of his window and begins to intone a well-worn tune. “In Piazza del Campo, the vervain grows,” he sings. A dog barks, reminding viewers of the mundanity of the performer’s environs. Then something happens that viewers might not expect: A chorus of invisible singers — residents quarantined in their homes in this medieval town, as per the Italian government’s national lockdown order — take up the song. The lyrics shift. “We don’t fear you, Corona; you are garbage, you disgust the city,” they sing. It’s powerful, inspiring, and spine-tingling as only great art can be. Except it’s not art. Or, at least it’s not art how we would usually define it, something on display in a museum or performed by professionals in theaters or concert halls. “High art” is the quintessential expression of genius, or so modern theories of art would have us believe. This narrative generally regards artists as special individuals with extraordinary talents beyond what ordinary people can imagine. Only a select few can be Michelangelo or Leonardo da Vinci; the rest of us should be satisfied with the chance to enjoy their masterworks. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a clarifying effect in a number of respects. For me, one of them is how limiting and frankly wrongheaded the modern take on the arts is at a moment when people all around the world have found authentic meaning expressing themselves creatively, whether through painting or baking. I’m not trying to say that museums and concert halls can’t play a positive role in promoting creativity. As a professor of aesthetics, I’ve made a career out of my love and passion for the high arts. However, I’m also not blind to the limitations of formal art world institutions, which are often oppressive, exclusionary, and colonialist to their very core. Take the negligible number of exhibitions given to female artists at major museums, for instance. Likewise, the above choice to highlight two white European men as examples of the ideal artist wasn’t an accident. What I want to lament here, however, is the disproportionate attention that professionalized art enjoys. I often compare it to eating at a Michelin three-star restaurant. Such an establishment can certainly provide a rewarding dining experience. But ultimately it is — and should be — a special treat. And not just because of the cost: There is widely recognized value in the simplicity of a home-cooked dish, in the very act of making, eating, and sharing it, that fine dining cannot replicate. Nights out are the exception, not the norm. Yet in the arts, it’s quite the opposite. We have normalized the consumption of three-star creative expressions: museums, art galleries, concert halls. This system not only limits our daily exposure to creativity — not even Parisians can visit the Louvre every day — but also teaches us to treat ourselves as passive spectators. The devaluation of everyday creations is part of a precise hierarchy of different forms of creativity. In it, works that cognitive scientist Margaret Boden would term “historical creativity” — the creation of something valuable and surprising that did not exist before — are treated as the only genuine type of creativity. That covers much of high art. But there is another type of creativity: psychological creativity, or the capacity to come up with something valuable and surprising to the creator themselves. This can be anything from a child’s drawing to the songs of Siena residents. The coronavirus-induced isolation that we have all experienced to some degree reveals the importance of this type of psychological creativity. It fills us with joy, while opening space for expressing and reflecting upon our present emotions and feelings. Coming up with something that feels valuable to us, no matter the quality of the product, can be an effective way of healing the soul. Experts have long recognized the value of psychological creativity in dealing with grief, for instance, and that’s an emotion all too many of us have felt recently.   For evidence, look no farther than violinist Aldo Cicchini’s “Cloud Concert.” An Italian-Uruguayan resident of Milan’s Chinatown, Cicchini plays the violin in the official orchestra of Italy’s national television station, RAI. After Italy went into lockdown, he began giving performances from his balcony. One of these impromptu shows went viral in China after his neighbor shared the video on microblogging platform Weibo. It was an unpolished, DIY recording, far from the rarified atmospheres of the concert hall. After the clip received a lot of buzz, Cicchini opened up a Weibo account of his own to publish his videos. Weibo users didn’t just appreciate the videos he posted, however. Instead, amateur music bloggers built on them, one after another, each adding their own touch to Cicchini’s performance of composer Carlos Gardel’s “Por una Cabeza” in what some netizens referred to as a “nesting doll,” or taowa, performance. One nesting doll started with a user playing along on the accordion, then another musician, introducted to the trend by his daughters, added a cello, and so on. Interestingly, the Chinese participants didn’t show their faces while performing. This decision to stay away from the spotlight suggests their participation was motivated by more than just a desire to be seen or gain publicity. Of course those reasons are factors, but their choice to remain faceless also highlighted a desire to create together, rather than be popular. Pablo Picasso is believed to have said: “It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.” The painter’s intended meaning was unclear, but one interpretation would be that there is something truly special in the value that children find in being creative. Those words suddenly popped into to my mind the other day, while looking at pictures that my brother had sent me of my 3-year old niece, Matilde. Locked down with her family in Leeds, she was amusing herself by throwing confetti in the air. The joy she got from this seemingly mundane activity was infectious. We can’t all aspire to be Leonardos, but we can certainly learn how to be Matildes.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005510
"After the Lockdown, a Frantic Harvest in Hubei",Farmers are rushing to gather crops before they rot in the ground. But the losses are already devastating.,2020-04-17,"HUBEI, Central China — In a chain of fields on the outskirts of Wuhan, dozens of figures stand knee-deep in muddy water, hauling lotus roots out of the ground. The water is frigid, but the laborers are working quickly. They extract and clean the roots with practiced skill, before piling them on the sides of the fields, ready to be shipped away for processing. For farmers in this part of central China, the spring harvest has become a desperate race against time.  The coronavirus pandemic — which caused Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei to be put under total lockdown — effectively froze their businesses for 76 days. Fields were left untended. Crops couldn’t be gathered. Sales and distribution channels broke down, and processing factories were shuttered. Now, producers have only a few weeks to get in the harvest, before their crops begin rotting in the fields. For Chen Zhongcheng, a local farm owner with 6,800 mu (roughly 4.5 square kilometers) of lotus root fields, it’s a make-or-break situation.  “The pandemic has already cost us a few million yuan in losses,” Chen tells Sixth Tone. “We have to make full use of every second to dig out as many lotus roots as we can ... If we fail, we’ll lose even more.” The failure of the lotus root harvest would be a major blow to rural communities in central China, which have already been severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. Hubei province is famous for the quality of its lotus roots — a popular ingredient in Chinese cuisine — and the region accounts for around one-quarter of China’s total production of the vegetable. The industry is worth billions of yuan to the local economy. “The history of lotus root planting in Hubei can be traced back over 1,000 years,” says Ke Weidong, an aquatic vegetable expert at the Wuhan Academy of Agricultural Sciences. “(It’s) become a pillar industry for many counties in Hubei, as well as a major source of income for a lot of farmers.” Farming revenues, however, are set to plunge this year. Chen says he sold his lotus roots for up to 10 yuan ($1.40) per kilogram in previous years, but the market price has now dropped to just one-fifth the previous number. Prices could fall more over the coming weeks. “With the farms resuming work, the huge amount of lotus roots will make the market oversupplied and lead to another price drop,” says Ke.  Local farms, meanwhile, are still severely short-staffed. Despite the easing of China’s lockdown policies, travel in Hubei remains partially restricted. People returning to Wuhan have to acquire a “health code” through popular payment apps WeChat or Alipay, which use big data to gauge whether users are considered a health risk. For many of Chen’s workers, however, this requirement is difficult to fulfill. “They’re barely literate, they don’t have smartphones, and they have no idea how to acquire such a ‘green code,’” says Chen. Chen would normally have around 70 employees in the fields gathering lotus roots at this time of year, but when Sixth Tone visits on April 12 there are only about 30. He’s tried to hire more staff, but doing so is difficult, and new recruits might be much less efficient than experienced laborers. “Digging up lotus roots is such hard work that many young people aren’t willing to do it nowadays,” says Chen. “It’s hard to find skilled lotus root diggers — they need rich experience and good judgment … If a lotus root is broken, it’s as worthless as mud.”  Chen tells Sixth Tone there are still 13,000 tons of lotus roots in his fields, and his shrunken team only has until the end of April to harvest as many of them as possible. That’s putting laborers like Liu Ying under pressure. The 52-year-old, who has been working on lotus root farms for three decades, would normally harvest around 300 kilograms of the vegetable each day. Now, she’s digging out 500 kilograms daily. When Sixth Tone speaks with her, she says she worked six hours that morning and would likely continue until after 7 p.m.  “My back is so painful, I can’t even stand up straight,” she tells Sixth Tone. Liu, however, is relieved to be working again. During the lockdown, she had no income whatsoever. She tells Sixth Tone she often prayed she could soon return to Wuhan, worrying how she’d be able to support her husband and 12-year-old son, who live in her hometown of Dazhou, southwestern Sichuan province. “I’m under a lot of pressure. If not, I wouldn’t be working outside (my home province),” she tells Sixth Tone. “Is there any woman my age who would enjoy such a tough job?” Liu managed to catch a train back to Wuhan March 31, after the transportation restrictions in Hubei started to ease. Chen sent drivers to pick her and other returnees up from the station, as local bus services were still shut down. The heavy workload at least gives laborers like Liu the chance to recoup some lost income. Workers on Chen’s farm get paid by the piece. For each kilogram of lotus root they harvest, they earn just under 1 yuan. “Many hope they can dig out as many lotus roots as they can,” says Liu. “They won’t stop until after dark.”  Feng Yichuang, another laborer, is using a high-pressure water gun to blast away the mud, allowing him to harvest the roots faster. He says it can help workers earn an extra 100 yuan per day. “But it requires people to use all their strength to hold the water gun,” the 41-year-old says. “The first week I got this machine, I couldn’t even feel my hands after work was over.” For Chen, the reversal in his fortunes over the past months has been bewildering. On Jan. 20, he hosted a banquet for his employees, where he toasted each table, shouting, “Here’s to a bumper harvest this year!” as he drained his glass. The Wuhan lockdown occurred just three days later. Now, he’s facing challenges from all sides. Apart from shutting down his business, the pandemic has also considerably raised his costs. “We have to offer them (the workers) rides to Wuhan, provide accommodation, and get them protective equipment like masks,” says Chen. “So, for each mu of lotus roots we fail to harvest, we’ll lose at least 3,000 yuan.”  Chen plans to export the highest-quality lotus roots to Southeast Asia, while the rest will be processed into lotus root slices and sold in China as a cooking ingredient. He fears, however, that domestic buyers will be wary of his produce. Hubei province — which was the center of the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak with over 68,000 confirmed cases — has been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories. Articles with headlines such as, “Don’t Eat Fruit Planted in Hubei,” “Salt Produced in Hubei Carries COVID-19,” and “Will People Catch the Coronavirus If They Receive Packages from Wuhan?” have been widely shared on Chinese social media in recent months.  Though Chinese authorities and experts have repeatedly rebutted these claims and assured customers that products from Hubei are safe, Chen still doesn’t feel confident enough to reopen his lotus root slice factory. “If we resume production, we’ll have to label the packages with their manufacturing dates and origins,” says Chen. “Chinese consumers might not be ready to accept that.” In early spring, Hubei’s farmers usually sell millions of kilograms of lotus root sprouts to growers in other provinces. This year, however, sales dropped significantly, as buyers were reluctant to travel to Hubei, according to Ke. To boost consumer confidence in Hubei sprouts, the municipal party secretary of Honghu — a city in Hubei famous for its lotus roots — made her debut hosting a livestream show promoting the local specialty April 1. Liu simply hopes to get through to July, when the early summer crops will be ready to be put on the market. “It’s going to be the happiest time for us — the weather won’t be too hot to work, the market will be eager for this seasonal product, and the boss will pay us more,” she says. “Then, the boss will be happy, and we’ll be happy, too.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005501
Wuhan’s Revised COVID-19 Data Shows 50% Increase in Deaths,"The city’s outbreak control command center said twice-counted cases were deducted, while probable cases among people who died without being diagnosed or admitted to hospital were added.",2020-04-17,"Authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have issued new coronavirus data indicating more confirmed cases and deaths than had been previously reported. In a statement Friday, the municipal outbreak control and prevention command center said that as of the previous day, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the city had been revised to 50,333, up from 50,008. The total number of confirmed deaths, meanwhile, was raised by 1,290 — from 2,579 to 3,869 — an increase of exactly 50%. The command center said the revision had come after a thorough check conducted by the relevant departments — including the health bureau, diseases control and prevention department, public security bureau, and statistics bureau — “in order to ensure that the city ’s COVID-19 information is open and transparent, and that the data is accurate so as to be in line with the principles of being responsible to history, the people, and the deceased.” The command center gave four reasons for the revised figure. First, the large number of patients in the early stage of the outbreak overwhelmed the city’s medical resources, resulting in some patients dying in their homes without ever being admitted to a hospital. Second, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, medical staff were so busy that some cases were “late, missed, or incorrect.” Third, while designated medical institutions — including privately operated and makeshift hospitals — were added, some of these facilities were not connected to the reporting system. Finally, information available upon death was sometimes incomplete, affecting the accuracy of some reporting. The revised statistics were announced after being checked against online records from the city’s big data network, funeral information system, medical administration and management system, and nucleic acid testing system, in addition to the records of clinics, hospitals, isolation points, outbreak-affected communities, prisons, elder care facilities, residential complexes, police stations, businesses, and household units. In an interview Friday with the state-owned Xinhua News Agency, an unnamed official from the command center said the revised data comes at a time “when the spread of the disease has been basically blocked, and travel restrictions surrounding Wuhan have been lifted, creating favorable conditions for a comprehensive and detailed review and correction of the data.” In the revised figures, 217 duplicate reports were subtracted from Wuhan’s total number of confirmed cases while 542 missed reports were added, according to the official. As for the revised death toll, 164 duplicate or non-coronavirus-related deaths were deducted from the previous figure while 1,454 missed reports — those who died without being admitted to hospitals, or late or missed reports from some medical institutions — were added. As of Thursday, the National Health Commission had reported a total of 3,342 deaths and 82,367 confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland, though these numbers will likely change to reflect the new data from Wuhan.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005514
How COVID-19 Could Shape the Future of 5G,"The pandemic was an early test of the technology’s capabilities, but it also hinted at what’s to come.",2020-04-16,"This article is part of an ongoing series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. The first article can be found here. On Wednesday, Leishenshan Hospital, a makeshift COVID-19 treatment facility in the central city of Wuhan, transferred its last four remaining patients to another institution and closed its doors. Leishenshan and its sister facility, Huoshenshan, catapulted into the public eye in late January when Wuhan announced plans to build the two pop-up hospitals in less than two weeks. Over the ensuing days, tens of millions tuned in to livestream feeds of the construction sites. Some even gave the equipment cute nicknames and shared fan art. Less well-known is that the stream was uploaded via a 5G network built specifically for the hospital’s use. China issued the first 5G licenses to its state-owned mobile carriers in June of last year. Although public adoption remains limited, commercial uses of the technology gradually grew over the second half of 2019, from harbor management to digital medicine. But even industry insiders like me weren’t expecting to have to figure out its integration into a nationwide anti-epidemic effort so soon after its initial rollout. 5G is not a simple linear extension of its predecessors: Whereas earlier network technologies primarily revolved around connectivity, 5G’s virtue lies in its ability to combine a smorgasbord of resources — including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, edge computing, and blockchain — into one user-friendly package. Although 5G base stations have a shorter range than their 4G counterparts, they can connect far more devices at once. If 4G is an “information highway,” then 5G is a three-dimensional transportation network comprising land, sea, and air. It’s also much faster. On-site testing revealed that the downlink rate from the Huoshenshan 5G station to a mobile phone was up to 921 Mbps, while the uplink rate reached 133 Mbps — that latter figure almost seven times as fast as a 4G network. This made uploading a high-resolution livestream of the construction process a walk in the park.  Of course, the 5G towers weren’t built to provide netizens entertainment — 4G would have been enough for that. The next generation network also played an important role in powering remote consultation systems during the outbreak. In addition to high bandwidth and high speeds, 5G boasts a high degree of reliability and low latency. Reliable, low-latency transmission of high-definition video in real time is a prerequisite to accurate remote diagnostics. In this regard, 5G sets standards that were rarely if ever possible under 4G, allowing not just for video conferencing, but stronger integration with hospital systems, digital records, and data stored on the cloud. On Feb. 9, Huoshenshan Hospital and Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army General Hospital carried out their first remote consultation over 5G. Since then, Hubei’s Leishenshan Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital, as well as the southwestern Sichuan province’s health commission and West China Hospital, have all started offering remote consultations via 5G. While remote diagnosis is one way 5G has been used during the ongoing pandemic, there are many more potential applications that we haven’t even begun to explore. In addition to drawing lessons from the past few months, we must also reflect on new “typical scenarios” that have arisen during the pandemic and consider how they could affect potential common implementations of the technology in the future. What do I mean by “typical scenarios”? Allow me to give an example. A number of video conference systems and voice conference systems already existed before 2003. Yet Chinese companies showed little interest in the nascent technology before SARS burst into the national consciousness that year and people began carrying out meetings and conferences by video to avoid unnecessary contact. Once the outbreak was brought under control, people continued to use this technology frequently, in part because they had become accustomed to it. Likewise, we should summarize the scenarios that have arisen during this particular outbreak to see how they could be adapted for use with 5G technology. For instance, in the last couple of months, Chinese schools have adopted online education en masse. However, in its current form, “online education” is essentially limited to sharing information, with teachers merely uploading some information and holding classes on the internet. Formal education requires an organized space, as well as real-time instruction and teacher-student exchanges. 5G opens up the possibility of virtual reality or augmented reality classrooms. It can support the transfer of more data, including real-time biometric readings on students that could potentially measure interest and attention. COVID-19 has shed light on a number of problems with China’s public health emergency response system. We should reflect on potential approaches to building and running so-called smart cities and how best to bring 5G, big data, AI, and other technologies together to better serve communities. So far we have only seen a glimpse of 5G’s potential. But I believe it will continue to open doors for us in the years to come, setting us on the fast track toward the smart society of the future.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005453
To Hell and Back: How Wuhan’s ICU Doctors Survived COVID-19,Infections spread like wildfire. Then a shortage of protective equipment struck. But the city's intensive care units found ways to continue fighting.,2020-04-15,"HUBEI, Central China — Zhou Qing still remembers the dismay she felt on Jan. 22 as she walked into Wuhan No. 7 Hospital to begin her emergency assignment. Two days previously, the renowned Chinese epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan had publicly confirmed the coronavirus that was spreading rapidly through Wuhan was capable of human-to-human transmission. Zhou, an intensive care specialist with three decades of medical experience, had been dispatched to No. 7 Hospital — a mid-ranking facility in the central Chinese city — to lead its intensive care unit during the epidemic. She quickly realized her new colleagues were wholly unprepared for the crisis that was about to engulf them. “They were not aware this was a serious issue,” says Zhou, who was speaking with Sixth Tone on Friday at the ICU inside Wuhan’s Leishenshan Hospital, a “pop-up” facility for housing COVID-19 patients.  No. 7 medical staff wearing protective suits often left their necks exposed, because they felt it was more comfortable, according to Zhou. The air conditioners were left running, despite the risk of spreading viral droplets. The ICU, meanwhile, already had four patients with COVID-19-like symptoms, but the wards hadn’t been overhauled to prevent cross-contamination from room to room. According to Zhou, all non-infectious disease hospitals are supposed to overhaul wards in the face of such an infectious virus. “It was also horrifying to see their anesthetists performing intubations on patients without wearing protective shields,” says Zhou. “All they had were protective goggles and a mask.”  The lack of protective measures quickly led to a wave of cross-infections that swept through No. 7’s medical team, making it even harder for the hospital to cope with its large influx of COVID-19 patients. The second day after Zhou’s arrival, the ICU director at No. 7 fell sick, later testing positive for the coronavirus. In total, around 40 of the hospital’s 200 medical workers were infected, according to Zhou. Many other medical workers in Wuhan have similar stories to tell. The epidemic in the Chinese metropolis is finally starting to subside, with only 179 coronavirus patients remaining out of more than 50,000 confirmed cases in total. On Wednesday, the 1,600-bed Leishenshan Hospital closed its doors after transferring out its last four patients. Yet doctors in the city remain haunted by the chaos of the early stages of the outbreak, when hospitals were overrun by a sudden surge of pneumonia patients. “There were patients in the ICU who were conscious. Even though they were breathing with much difficulty, their eyes were filled with a strong will to survive,” Zhou tells Sixth Tone. “Some held my hand and said, ‘Please save me.’ But we eventually lost them.” Until the crisis erupted, Wuhan appeared to be well-prepared for a public health emergency. With nearly 400 hospitals, 40,000 licensed doctors, and 54,500 registered nurses, the city has long taken pride in its health system, which is among the best in China.  Within weeks of the virus emerging, however, the city’s medical resources proved to be completely insufficient. By late January, many pneumonia patients in Wuhan were unable to get hospitalized or tested for COVID-19. A significant factor behind the city’s inability to cope was the huge number of infections among medical staff during this crucial period, as hospitals struggled to implement measures to contain cross-infections, health workers in the city tell Sixth Tone. “Many doctors in the respiratory and infectious diseases departments, as well as doctors in the emergency departments, were down with the virus,” says Zhou. “That definitely reduced the strength of the medical team … Our main forces were down.” By early March, more than 3,000 medical workers in Hubei province — the central region where Wuhan is located — had been infected with the coronavirus, government officials confirmed in a press conference, with 40% happening inside hospitals. Every hospital in Wuhan experienced a high number of cross-infections, according to Chen Yongfeng, an employee in the medical affairs department of Zhongnan Hospital — a top-tier facility in Wuhan, where Zhou Qing also works as the ICU’s deputy director.  “Many medical workers got infected. In our hospital, over 100 were infected,” says Chen. Zhongnan employs over 3,000 staff total. A large number of infections took place before Jan. 21, when China’s health authorities confirmed that the virus was contagious. At that stage, many medical workers were still unaware of the danger they were facing. “Most (medical workers) got infected when the virus remained barely known,” says Zhou. “At (Zhongnan) hospital, most infected medical staff came from the surgical departments … Many surgeons didn’t take precautions and therefore got infected.”  Doctors often caught the virus from patients who had been hospitalized due to other health conditions, but later also tested positive for COVID-19. According to Chen, a single pancreatitis patient infected more than 10 staff members in Zhongnan’s surgical department during the early weeks of the outbreak. “The patient’s pneumonia symptoms weren’t discovered until the operation,” says Chen. An infection control worker at Hubei General Hospital, who requested anonymity for privacy reasons, says hospitals were initially unsure how to prevent the coronavirus from spreading among staff. “The virus just caught us off guard,” she tells Sixth Tone. “We had little understanding of the new virus. We didn’t have sufficient protection … Once we got to know it, the virus was no longer that terrifying.” The person declined to reveal the number of staff infected at her hospital. She added, however, that the situation was particularly challenging for general hospitals, which don’t focus on treating infectious diseases. “Although all medical staff are equipped with knowledge about infectious diseases, few had real experience dealing with such diseases or patients,” she says. “That meant they had a lack of real combat capability.”  Hubei General Hospital staff members routinely wear regular surgical masks while attending patients, the infection control worker says, but these masks proved to be insufficient against COVID-19. “We didn’t know how infectious the virus was,” she says. “We acquired all our information from media outlets, like average residents.” Doctors on the front lines appear to have grasped the gravity of the situation earlier, allowing them to take potentially life-saving precautions. Ai Fen, director of the emergency room at Wuhan Central Hospital, urged the 200 staff members in her department to protect themselves as early as Jan. 1, after hearing that a SARS-like coronavirus was behind a spike in pneumonia cases in Wuhan. “I asked everyone to wear a mask, wear a medical hat, and disinfect their hands frequently,” Ai told the Chinese magazine Renwu in March. “Once a male nurse didn’t wear a mask. I yelled at him right on the scene. I told him not to come to work if he didn’t wear a mask.” In early January, medical workers in Ai’s department were forced to conceal their protective uniforms under their white gowns, as the hospital wanted to avoid a public panic, according to Ai. “But it’s not standard practice — it was ridiculous,” Ai said.  By March, over 200 staff members at Wuhan Central Hospital had been infected with the virus. Five of them died: three from the ophthalmology department, one surgeon, and one member of the hospital’s ethics committee. At Zhongnan Hospital, the emergency room, ICU, and respiratory disease department were able to avoid widespread infections by taking early and decisive action to protect staff, according to Chen. “Doctors there have stronger awareness of (the importance of) self-protection,” says Chen. In Zhongnan’s ICU, none of the nearly 200 workers were infected. Zhou puts this down to the team’s diligent attitude toward sanitation — a result of their long experience battling the spread of drug-resistant superbugs. Ding Xinbo, head nurse at the ICU, tells Sixth Tone the department repeatedly reminded workers to wear a mask and wash their hands frequently. “Even though we work in the most dangerous environment, it’s also the safest,” says Ding.  Zhongnan’s emergency room received its first COVID-19 patient Jan. 6. At that stage, the local health commission was telling medical staff that such pneumonia patients probably caught a virus from animals at the nearby South China Seafood Wholesale Market. The hospital’s ICU team, however, decided to implement top-level protection and quarantine procedures regardless. Staff began wearing so-called level 3 protective equipment, including a mask, hazmat suit, latex gloves, protective face shield, and shoe covers. “We assumed the infectiousness was limited, and we didn’t expect so many would get infected,” recalls Zhou. “But within one day, we received four patients in critical condition.” Three days later, all 16 beds in the ICU were full. Though the safety measures helped protect staff, the ICU struggled to acquire sufficient protective equipment in the early weeks of the area’s epidemic. “I remember our director telling us it would be so pathetic if we ended up rescuing our own colleagues,” says Ding, the head nurse.  In early February, just after the Lunar New Year holiday, the shortage of equipment was severe. Zhou’s team at No. 7 hospital was forced to constantly reuse the same pairs of goggles — immersing them in disinfectant, and then repeatedly disinfecting and washing them. After putting on their protective suits, ICU staff had to keep them on for six hours at a time, unable to take a break. Later, they were able to leave the ICU once every four hours. As the epidemic in Wuhan reached its peak in February, Zhou recalls often blaming herself for failing to save more lives.  “I was feeling extremely depressed and under huge pressure,” she tells Sixth Tone. “Patients in the ICU are commonly in critical condition, but in the past not all of them would be in life-threatening situations at the same time.” Over time, however, the city’s hospitals were able to stabilize the situation. In mid-March, all the ICU beds at No. 7 Hospital remained fully occupied, but Zhou’s team had introduced better, standardized practices to cope with the large number of patients. Zhou, who describes herself as a rational, levelheaded person during normal times, says she began to feel more emotionally stable. “But the loss of so many lives unavoidably made me feel gloomy from time to time,” she says. “I still experience lots of mood swings every day.” On March 20, Zhou was made executive director of the ICU at Leishenshan Hospital, where 3,000 medical workers from over 200 different hospitals had been stationed. She continued her work at Leishenshan until Tuesday, when her last patients left the ICU. The closure of the hospital, which was built over a manic 10 days from Jan. 25, is a symbolic moment for Wuhan — another small step back toward normality. The facility will be left idle for the next few months, however, ready to reopen in the case of a second wave of infections.  Zhou is supposed to take a 14-day vacation, before returning to work at Zhongnan Hospital. But she doubts she’ll take such a long time off. During Wuhan’s 76-day lockdown, many residents with late-stage cancer, uremia, and other severe illnesses were unable to access treatment, as wards were converted to accommodate COVID-19 patients. Now that the number of people with COVID-19 has declined, these patients require urgent care. “The mortality rate for COVID-19 (in Wuhan) is 5%, but if those patients don’t get timely treatment, they’re definitely going to die,” says Chen, the medical affairs worker. “If I take a two-week break, the hospital might go crazy,” says Zhou. “We have to open the wards to treat these patients.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005491
"On Secondhand Marketplace, Firsthand Accounts From a Pandemic","During the COVID-19 outbreak, China’s Craigslist-like P2P sales app Xianyu has been a thrift store, pet-feeding service, and source of consolation all rolled into one.",2020-04-15,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Xianyu was an online platform where people could go to buy others’ possessions or sell their own. Over the past few months, however, it has evolved to encompass a much larger role. For most Chinese people, the outbreak has affected not their lungs, but their bank accounts. Baidu, the country’s most widely used search engine, said that during the pandemic, queries for “credit card overdue” reached a 10-year high, while people in Wuhan, the central city where the new coronavirus was first detected, searched for things like “hiring information,” “unemployment insurance,” and “loan interest rates.” As weeks dragged into months, people began parting, reluctantly, with the things they loved. Simply searching for the keyword “pandemic” yields pages of results of people selling their possessions — from fancy lipstick purchased as a treat to costlier items like cars — for whatever cash they can get. Zhang, who owns a makeup business in the northeastern Liaoning province, told Sixth Tone that in order to keep earning money, she contracted a local factory to produce a modified fisherman’s hat with a plastic face shield to guard against infectious droplets. Meanwhile, farmers — an especially vulnerable group during the pandemic — have used the platform to offload their unsold fruits, vegetables, and flowers.  “Compared with other e-commerce platforms like Taobao and JD.com, Xianyu as a customer-to-customer platform is more accessible to users,” Tao Yin, a public relations representative for the Alibaba-owned company, told Sixth Tone. There are lower barriers to entry, Tao said, and “that’s why people like farmers are able to use it.” During the pandemic, the Xianyu mobile app has borne witness to canceled plans and broken dreams. One of the platform’s 200 million users tried to sell a black dress she had bought for a vacation that had put on hold indefinitely, while another user turned to the platform to sell ukuleles after his musical instrument shop was closed. “I had planned to open a cat café this year, but due to the COVID-19 outbreak I couldn’t make it happen,” one user wrote. “I have many cats that are 5 to 6 months old. I hope I can find some good people who will give them a home.”  With virtually every industry suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic, Xianyu has been one of the few companies in China that has remained profitable. In March, its number of newly registered users grew by nearly 40% compared with the same period last year, with daily transactions reaching an all-time high. Economists have said that during the pandemic, secondhand trading platforms like Xianyu act as sponges, allowing users to earn money through sales and buyers to obtain goods at low prices. According to Tao, Xianyu doesn’t charge transaction fees; instead, it makes most of its money from advertisers. He added that recently, creative patrons have explored uses for the platform beyond the usual item-for-cash arrangement, with some using it as a job-hunting service. A search for “lost my job” returns many results for users promoting services such as web design and online tutoring, while users without a particular skill have simply offered to chat with people who are lonely. At times during the pandemic, Xianyu has been a source of heartwarming altruism. Hundreds of users have volunteered to provide free pet-feeding services for people who haven’t been able to return to their homes because of travel restrictions. Zhu Xilei, a woman from the eastern city of Wuxi, is one of them. In late January, she posted on Xianyu to say she was happy to help people who weren’t able to feed their own pets. “One owner was very grateful and kept thanking me,” Zhu told Sixth Tone. “Although I volunteered to do the job for free, the owner insisted on giving me a red envelope,” she added, referring to the virtual cash-stuffed packets that are commonly exchanged in China.  With monthslong quarantine and home-isolation policies leaving people across the country more bored than ever, many Xianyu users have begun sharing their favorite recipes on the app and encouraging others to do the same. Meanwhile, Lego aficionados have offered their tutelage to apprentice builders to help pass the time. The app overflows with reminders of people’s shared humanity in the face of great adversity. On April 7, when Wuhan lifted its citywide lockdown after 76 days, some sellers celebrated the occasion by lowering their already-low prices. Just a few days prior, when the grieving nation observed an especially raw Qingming Festival, or Tomb-Sweeping Day, many Xianyu users offered to visit the gravesites of people who were unable to go themselves, cleaning them according to custom and leaving offerings for the deceased.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005489
Frustrated Parents Demand Refunds From Expensive Private Schools,Parents say they’re dissatisfied with online learning options being provided during the coronavirus pandemic.,2020-04-15,"Private international schools in China are facing refund requests from parents unsatisfied with online learning as many institutions remain closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Parents of students at the Sanlitun campus of the British School of Beijing were recently told they must pay tuition of as much as 70,000 yuan ($10,000) even though only online classes are being provided. Some parents complained that the e-learning doesn’t justify the cost. “I can teach my child math and Chinese myself,” a parent of a first-grader told Caixin. “With the expensive tuition, the education provided by the school can’t meet our expectations.” Choosing a private international school is more about immersion education than simply teaching math and Chinese, the parent said. Other international schools in Beijing are also facing refund disputes. The International School of Beijing, a pre-K through grade 12 private school in Beijing’s suburban Shunyi District; Dulwich College Beijing, a British international school; and Western Academy of Beijing are in similar straits. China’s Ministry of Education last week issued a notice forbidding schools from charging tuition in advance. But for many private schools, advance payment is the only way to keep their operations going, administrators said. Revenue loss during the epidemic has already put some private kindergartens at risk of closure. “Our teachers are working hard every day, and we have to make sure they get paid,” Sanlitun school Principal John Brett said in a communication with parents. The school still hasn’t posted a reopening date. The British School of Beijing at Sanlitun, a private school from kindergarten to sixth grade, is part of the Hong Kong-based company Nord Anglia Education. The school accepts only foreigners or Chinese with foreign citizenship or permanent residence, according to a parent. The Sanlitun school and Nord Anglia Education didn’t respond to Caixin’s requests for comment. The school is urging parents to pay tuition for the next session running April 6 to June 18. Principal Brett stressed that tuition is the school’s only revenue source. Since the Lunar New Year break from late January to early February, the school has been closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, like most other schools in China. Meanwhile, the school is offering e-learning via email. A kindergarten’s e-learning class includes a prerecorded video of less than two minutes from the teacher, a picture, and four pages of coloring homework, aiming to teach children to pronounce and write the English letter “P,” according to an email provided by a parent. Several parents said they want the school to provide online teaching equivalent to offline classes as much as possible, but they also complained that the online education created an “overwhelming” burden for parents who have to sit through the classes with younger children. A second-grader’s parent said some parents do not have sufficient English skills to help their children with lessons. To improve teaching quality, the school started a weekly half hour of live teaching through Zoom, a popular video conferencing tool, in late March. But the class turned out to be more like online chatting rather than teaching, parents said. In the latest plan, the principal said the school is considering providing free summer classes for all students starting June 22, and offering free tutoring once the school reopens. However, as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread globally, it’s still uncertain when the school’s many foreign teachers can come back to Beijing. Many parents said they are pessimistic about the outlook for reopening in the near term.

"Trapped by a Pandemic, Decoding Messages From Other Worlds","Sci-fi writer Chen Qiufan reflects on dystopia, fear, and the meaning of world literature at a time of crisis.",2020-04-14,"The COVID-19 epidemic is now a global pandemic. Almost all industries have been hit hard, my own among them. Bookshops are closed, printing presses have stopped, and sales are cratering. Of course, we’re not just taking our fate lying down: Editors are promoting new works via livestreaming apps, authors are reaching out and interacting directly with readers online, and e-books are being rushed to digital stores to meet the demand from quarantined book lovers. The English translation of my 2018 short story, “State of Trance,” is in the fray. Included in the forthcoming “The Book of Shanghai,” a collection of 10 short stories about that globalized metropolis, it’s written in the second person to unspool the story of a “cognitive avalanche” that has spread across the world like a plague, stripping humans of their rationality and ability to think for themselves. One night, with civilization on the verge of collapse, the protagonist — “You” — decides to walk to the Shanghai Library to return a book they had borrowed, in a final bid to uphold the tattered social contract. My work has been translated into roughly 20 languages. More than once, however, I’ve been asked by non-Chinese why they should read a story from such a distant and remote country, one so strange and hard for them to understand — especially when the reading experience is so highly dependent on the skill and quality of the translator. In response, I used to always give the same ingratiating, yet simple, answer: “Precisely because it depicts something you may never go through in your life. By reading my story, you can experience something new, and isn’t that miraculous?” Nowadays, however, I would answer differently. I wrote the entirety of “State of Trance” sitting on my bed one morning in early 2018. The process was nothing like my other novels. Normally, I’m what George R. R. Martin would call an architect. I work out the entire framework of the story ahead of time and advance the plot according to a logical sequence. But for “State of Trance,” I tried something more akin to the spontaneous prose of Jack Kerouac. Letting my thoughts leap onto the page, they ran about unrestrained, dribbling into little pools or surging together into great flowing rivers. This style corresponded nicely with the themes I hoped to express: as catastrophe approaches an international, ultra-modern 21st-century megacity, what becomes of the individual? Can they hold onto logic, rationality, and their refined way of being? Or do they collapse into perplexity, fear, and helplessness? I chose to describe the latter scenario: a world of dislocation and disassociation, giving way to something new and unfathomable. Two years on, isn’t that what we’re all feeling? I’m not a prophet, and I would never have predicted the surreal scenes depicted in my story would one day resonate to such a great extent with the real world. COVID-19 emerged without portent, jumping from person to person, household to household, country to country, spreading panic and chaos in its wake. Every person on this planet has been unwillingly drawn into this massive disaster: our lives a cycle of isolation, lockdown, panic buying. And yet, even more terrifying than the virus itself is the emotional plague that has spread alongside it, sowing doubt, hatred, hostility, and discrimination. Two years ago, I categorically could not have conceived of the world we live in today. Now I wonder if anyone today can fathom the strange future lying in wait for us, uncertain and crisis-filled, changed and challenging in equal measure. As the virus tears fissures into the global consensus, where can we turn to understand the value systems and emotional responses to death and disaster from other countries, other peoples, other persons? Do we lash out, xenophobic and angry? Or accept and show empathy toward one another? How do we get past the geopolitics, nationalism, and ideology of the modern world and remember a fundamental, if long-forgotten truth — that we all come from the same place? Perhaps I’m being too idealistic, even naïve, but I believe that literature has a way of resonating across the lines that divide us. And if we want to recall our common heritage, we can start by reading literature from distant, even supposedly “strange” lands. Take the in-your-face realism of Albert Camus’ novel “The Plague,” for example. Although Camus wrote about 1940s Algeria, his work is universal, and his definition of heroism — that heroes are ordinary people making extraordinary choices — is just as moving today as it was 70 years ago. Jose Saramago’s “Blindness,” Jean Giono’s “The Horseman on the Roof,” Margaret Atwood’s “Oryx and Crake,” despite being written in very different contexts, all remind us that, in a plague, there is always good and bad, foolishness and intelligence, fear and fearlessness, dishonor and heroism. Our similarities far outweigh our differences. Stories help us construct a spiritual breakwater with which to face the next crisis, reminding us that we’re not alone, that our experiences have precedent, and that we belong to something bigger than ourselves. In so doing, they can free our hearts from anxiety, panic, and restlessness and allow us to slowly reclaim a solid sense of strength and faith. With reality seeming to have run off the rails, trapping us in train cars dangling precipitously over the abyss, we need to embrace this resonance and overcome all forms of discrimination, animosity, and hostility. Only a unified humanity can hope to defeat the coronavirus — and whatever other challenges the future may have in store for us. As an author, I have no idea what will become of the publishing industry. I’ve spent much of the last few months cooped up indoors under quarantine, feeling anxious, insecure, and frustrated. Burned out by the pandemic, I’ve fallen back on the writer’s most effective method of self-preservation: throwing off the slough of anxiety, gathering my heart and mind, and embarking upon my next project. I want to use my imagination and take the strange and complicated experiences of the year so far and reform them, vary them, combine them, and collate them into a story of the future. Perhaps one day it, too, will resonate.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005473
I Spent Seven Weeks in a Wuhan ICU. Here’s What I Learned,A doctor reflects on nearly two months spent treating some of China’s most severe COVID-19 cases.,2020-04-13,"This article is part of a series of first-person accounts from medical workers who lived and worked in Wuhan over the past four months. The rest of the series can be found here. It was late at night on Jan. 24, the day after Wuhan went into lockdown, when I boarded a plane bound for the city as part of a 128-member medical support team sent from the southern Guangdong province to the epicenter of China’s COVID-19 epidemic. We received a brief training session the next day, and on Jan. 26, we were taken to the hospital ward where we would spend the next 54 days. I’ve been a doctor in an intensive care unit for 12 years, and during that time I’ve dealt with all manner of serious diseases. But stepping into that ward was the most terrifying moment of my life. The cleaning staff and security guards hired by the hospital — most of them contractors — were gone, and the hallways were covered in garbage bags and contaminated medical waste. The ward was staffed by a total of two ophthalmologists and two nurses who were expected to care for 85 critically ill patients in varying degrees of respiratory distress. Most of these patients should have been in an ICU, not a converted inpatient clinic. That first day, we watched as one of the doctors did their best to save a patient near death. It was no use: The hospital didn’t have enough oxygen left. Usually, when a patient sees someone in the same room die, they’ll have some kind of reaction. They might ask to change beds, or maybe they’ll turn and cover their head with their blanket. But the other patients in the room just watched, motionless, as the doctor tried to save the patient, as the patient died, as the body was taken away. It was as if nothing had happened.  State of Emergency We were stationed at Hankou Hospital, a mid-sized facility and one of the first three hospitals in the city to be converted into a full-time COVID-19 treatment center. The hospital received its first suspected case on Jan. 3, and by the middle of the month it was flooded with patients experiencing sudden chills and fevers. On Jan. 21, three days before our arrival, Hankou was designated a key facility for COVID-19 patients. Overnight, it opened 10 fever clinics. At the peak of the crisis, it received over 1,500 outpatient visits a day — five times the usual number. When we arrived, there wasn’t an empty bed in the building. Under normal circumstances, admitting more than five patients for observation at a time would be considered unusual. We had more than 80, many of them in serious condition. With no beds to spare, at least one patient died while hooked up to an IV in the emergency room. The staffing situation was equally bleak. A lack of warning and a severe shortage of personal protective equipment resulted in many frontline respiratory and critical care staff becoming infected. With this group incapacitated, members of the hospital’s internal medicine, gastroenterology, and surgery departments were brought into the fold. By the time we got there, those who hadn’t fallen ill were exhausted from the long hours. The ophthalmologists were the last line of defense. The remaining doctors and nurses burst into tears when they saw us arrive: If they had gone down, there would have been no one left to step in. Understandably, this bare-boned staff was too tired to worry about whether the requisite safeguards were fully in place, or whether their workflow and hours were safe, but these problems left them exposed. When the inpatient ward was turned into an ICU, the quarantine area should have been fully sealed off. Instead, wooden doors were installed between the ward’s sections, allowing patients, doctors, and medical waste to freely commingle. And the area where staff would change into their protective clothing was a dark room only 2 square meters in size. This was extremely dangerous: Protective equipment could be coated in the virus, and putting it on and taking it off in the dark risked accidental contamination. Back at the hotel that first night, we were in shock. Our team leader said things couldn’t go on like this. The next day, the first thing we did was take steps to prevent cross-infection. We temporarily sealed the gaps around the doors with adhesive foam strips while waiting for them to be upgraded. We also found someone to install lights and a mirror so staff could see when they removed their protective clothing. It paid off. When we left over a month later, my team had treated a total of 215 patients, 162 of them critical cases, without having a single member infected. Strange Symptoms Arriving in Wuhan, we knew little about COVID-19’s clinical attributes. When we asked some doctors from Shanghai who’d arrived before us, all they said was: “It’s complicated.” One of the first things we noticed was that our COVID-19 patients had a higher tolerance for hypoxia, a kind of oxygen deprivation, than typical viral pneumonia cases. Patients with other viral pneumonias, such as H1N1, typically develop fevers and feel weak after just 20% of their lungs are affected. But COVID-19 patients could develop severe pneumonia while experiencing only mild respiratory issues. Most patients I treated only had trouble breathing after 60% of their lungs or more were affected. Thus, the majority of patients displayed relatively mild symptoms in the first week. But this made the second week all the more critical, as patients’ conditions would deteriorate rapidly. Eventually, hospitals in Wuhan began telling staff that the decision to intubate a patient or not could not be made on the basis of their clinical symptoms. Many doctors came to the conclusion that, by the time a patient is having difficulty breathing, the death rate, even after intubation, is high: The earlier you act, the better. Doctors outside China have since made similar observations: One doctor in New York City told me that all the patients he had intubated later died. Bringing the death rate down was our top mission. Faced with so many unknowns, we tried just about everything. I spent my free time poring over the latest scientific literature and talking to my colleagues about what we could do and how we should adjust our treatment plan. We even experimented with drugs like chloroquine, the anti-malarial that U.S. President Donald Trump has hailed as a “game-changer,” though many of our patients experienced severe side effects and couldn’t continue the treatment. Indeed, in our experience, no medicine was particularly useful. Instead, the most effective solution was oxygen. For around 60% of our patients, oxygen saturation was improved by using oxygen masks with a reservoir bag. In more severe cases, we would also use a nasal cannula and an oxygen mask to increase the volume of oxygen. Getting hold of it was a headache, however, even as patients needed more breathing assistance. Early on, with oxygen worth its weight in gold, we did our best not to waste it.  Finally, after trying everything we could think of, we located a factory in Wuhan that could supply us with massive 25 kilogram oxygen cylinders. The cylinders proved effective at boosting severely ill patients’ blood oxygen levels, but they were taller than me and highly flammable, making transporting them through the hospital a fraught affair. At the peak of the outbreak, we went through 70 to 80 of them a day. It felt like fighting a war. The patients couldn’t live without oxygen, so we had to constantly monitor their condition. Hankou Hospital didn’t have ECMO machines to provide life support to critical patients, so our last resort was intubation and a ventilator. This sometimes required quick thinking. One night, we received a patient in extremely critical condition. His blood oxygen levels had dropped to 20%, and he was in a coma. We immediately intubated him and put him on a ventilator. Although he woke up and seemed to be recovering, after he depleted his first oxygen cylinder, we had issues attaching a new one. Unable to switch his ventilator back on, the patient’s face started to turn purple: a tell-tale sign of hypoxia in COVID-19 patients. I quickly pulled the tube out of his nose and put it directly into his mouth, which allowed him to start breathing again. By the time his condition stabilized, it was already 2 a.m. He almost died in front of me.  Close Shaves Working in a quarantine zone in a hazmat suit is not easy. It’s extremely stuffy in all that protective gear, and the shortage of equipment meant we often couldn’t change or go to the bathroom during our shifts. The main problem wasn’t poor preparation, but the sudden influx of patients that would have overwhelmed a stockpile even 10 times the size available. Early on, what we had wasn’t high quality. Some suits were very thin, so we wore two or three layers. The resulting get-up was really difficult to take off: We had to undress very slowly, layer by layer, otherwise the thin material would tear. Washing our hands between each layer, it would take 45 minutes to remove it all. During the worst of it, we relied on each other for support. One young nurse told us that when she felt stressed at home, she would give her pet a haircut to calm down. So the other doctors and nurses started going to her when they themselves needed a haircut. One doctor in Wuhan visited her five times to get his head shaved. Eventually, the city built 19 fangcang shelter hospitals, most of them to house mild and moderate cases. Combined with an influx of doctors from all over the country, they gradually relieved some of our pressure. And by February, some of the patients were showing signs of improvement. When we handed the ward back over to local staff on March 19, there were only 20 COVID-19 patients in Hankou Hospital. All of them had tested negative, though they had not yet fully recovered. Looking Back, and Out I was cleaning my home when my hospital called for volunteers willing to travel to Wuhan on Lunar New Year’s Eve. I don’t have children and having grown up in Hunan province, just south of Wuhan, I figured I would be more familiar with the region’s relatively cold, damp climate than some of my southern co-workers. As a clinician, I also thought I had a responsibility to learn more about this rare infectious disease. I never expected to see so much suffering, nor did I envision the outbreak becoming a worldwide pandemic. At the beginning, former classmates of mine who are doctors in Europe and the United States were all asking me whether we needed supplies or donations. They ultimately contributed a lot of supplies to help us. By the end of February, however, they were starting to ask about the situation on the front lines. One U.S.-based doctor I know told me that the director of his hospital was encouraging staff not to wear face masks for fear of causing panic among the patients. When he asked me for my opinion, I told him that none of the medical staff I knew who wore protective equipment had become ill. But the director of his hospital failed to take the hint. Now, my team is back in Guangdong and we have completed our 14 days of quarantine. A lot of us have also started donating face masks and protective clothing to doctors and friends in the U.S. But ultimately, many things are out of doctors’ control. If there are problems with the epidemic prevention system, and screening isn’t carried out as soon as possible, then medical workers will be left powerless.

Chinese Cities on Alert Over Rising COVID-19 Cases From Russia,"Several border cities, as well as Shanghai, have reported an increasing number of imported coronavirus cases over the past week.",2020-04-13,"An uptick in imported COVID-19 cases, mostly from Russia, has raised concerns in several Chinese cities about a fresh wave of infections. On Monday, health authorities in the northeastern Heilongjiang province said that all 49 newly reported imported coronavirus cases were among Chinese nationals returning from Russia. The border province had recently raised concerns over China’s COVID-19 prevention and control work, after an increasing number of coronavirus infections were found in locals arriving through the city of Suifenhe. Suifenhe, situated along the border with Russia, became the first city outside of Wuhan in the central Hubei province to “build” a makeshift hospital from a repurposed office last week. The city of 70,000 residents on Sunday suspended all public gatherings, after having closed its land border with the neighboring country last week and asked residents to remain indoors. China’s National Health Commission said Monday that there were 108 COVID-19 diagnoses reported in the country the previous day, the highest number of new daily infections in nearly six weeks. Of these, 98 were imported. As of Sunday, China had tallied 1,378 imported COVID-19 cases, while the total number of confirmed cases in the country stood at 82,160. Authorities in Harbin, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, announced Saturday that they were stepping up measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. All arriving international passengers will now be given two nucleic acid tests and an antibody test, as well as a mandatory quarantine period of 28 days. Housing units in the city with confirmed and asymptomatic cases will also be placed under lockdown for 14 days, and all residents there will be given nucleic acid tests and antibody tests, according to authorities. Other cities outside Heilongjiang also reported new infections among arrivals from Russia over the weekend. On Sunday, the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region reported 34 newly confirmed cases from Russia. All 34 people had entered China through the subprefectural border city of Manzhouli, a major port between China and Russia. According to domestic media, authorities in the city have set up a command center dedicated to handling imported cases, and all international arrivals are being required to observe 14 days’ quarantine. The municipal government has also ordered the creation of a 200-bed hospital that will be used to treat COVID-19 patients. On Sunday, the Shanghai Health Commission said there were 52 newly imported cases the previous day, with all but one coming from Chinese nationals arriving from Russia. The 51 others arrived on the same flight from Russia on April 10 at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Another 92 people who were in close contact with infected passengers have been tracked and are in quarantine. In late March, China banned foreigners — including those with valid visas and work permits — from entering the country. The move was ostensibly aimed at curbing imported infections, though the country’s foreign ministry had acknowledged that returning Chinese nationals were responsible for around 90% of such cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005478
Worried About the Price of Rice? Don’t Panic Just Yet,"Vietnam’s announced ban on rice exports sent Chinese consumers scrambling, but the country’s food supply remains relatively secure.",2020-04-10,"As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on the global economy, reports in late March that Vietnam, the world’s third-largest rice exporter, would ban international sales were greeted with unease in the world’s largest rice market. Although officials sought to reassure the public that China’s grain reserves remain well-stocked, many consumers still panicked, and pictures of empty supermarket bins or giant hoards of rice stacked up in living rooms circulated widely online. Since transitioning to a market economy beginning in the late 1970s, China has largely been able to leave its days of food scarcity behind. The last comparable incident — after the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown in 2011 — was minor and related more to fears of pollution than material scarcity. Grain, in particular, may be China’s most ample resource: According to an official document from 2019, China has managed to remain 95% self-sufficient in cereals over the last decade — a category that includes the so-called three main staples of rice, wheat, and corn. Even without accounting for the country’s tens of millions of tons in grain reserves, the total yield in 2019 would have been enough to provide every citizen 670 grams of rice or wheat daily, well in excess of official dietary guidelines.  In other words, there’s little logical reason for Chinese consumers to panic over shifts in Southeast Asia’s grain market. Even in 2008, when shortages caused the food trade to temporarily seize up in some parts of the world, the country was able to make it through the crisis by relying on its own resources. Nevertheless, consumer fears are somewhat understandable. Historically, economic and social crises have sent people scrambling after grains and other essentials. And while there’s no economic basis for hoarding in response to the current export bans, China’s grain sector does face problems: The spring sowing season, which directly determines the success of the summer harvest, accounts for about half of China’s total planted area in a year. In southern and central China, it also coincided with the peak of the country’s epidemic. The Chinese government started emphasizing the importance of a successful spring planting as early as February, at a time when most of the country was still under lockdown. The period between early March and mid-May is also when China’s food security is at its weakest, as many of the grains produced the prior year have already been consumed and the new crop has yet to reach markets. And even if China as a whole might not lack grain, inequalities exist when it comes to variety, production, and consumption across regions. If we compare a list of China’s top grain-producing regions to a map of COVID-19 infections, a number of things stand out. First, several eastern and southern provinces key to summer grain production reported relatively high numbers of cases, including Henan, Shandong, and Anhui. If they can’t get their agricultural sectors back on track quickly, it could put the harvest in doubt, potentially leading to shortages.  There is also cause for concern in the northeastern Heilongjiang province, an agricultural powerhouse with annual grain production in excess of 70 million tons, including 13% of the country’s rice. The province has lately been hit by a “second wave” of infections imported from abroad, mostly from Russia. The Chinese government has temporarily closed all land border crossings in the region, partly in order to ease the pressure on quarantine efforts and avoid disruption of the vital spring sowing season. But the challenge for Heilongjiang and other provinces exposed to the risk of a second wave of infection is how to kick-start spring farming while keeping epidemic prevention measures in place. At the same time, a country’s food security is dependent not just on total grain production, but also storage structures, regional distribution networks, processing, and logistics. China's regional patterns of grain production underwent a significant change in the 21st century, as grain production shifted from the south to the north, turning the former into a net importer. Thus, aside from the direct impact of the coronavirus on local agricultural production, we also have to pay close attention to transportation holdups between grain-producing regions and markets. At the height of the country’s COVID-19 epidemic, disruptions in logistics and labor mobility, including travel restrictions and roadblocks, severely curtailed the movement of farmworkers and produce. Traffic restrictions are being loosened, but costs continue to fluctuate. This could sever grain-producing regions from markets and nudge grain prices upward. In a sign that the authorities are aware of the risk, as early as mid-February the Ministry of Transport announced it would waive road tolls until the end of the outbreak.   Transaction costs pose another obstacle. Following years of market reforms, China’s grain purchasers are increasingly diverse: In addition to state-run grain depots, there are privately owned grain companies and a variety of grain-processing plants. Together they have made the grain market more competitive. But in times of crisis, it remains relatively difficult for non-state affiliated buyers to access subsidies and preferential policies available to the industry. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a number of market-oriented purchasers to pull back, putting the onus on state-owned grain companies to buy more. Simplifying the purchasing network could decrease market efficiency and increase trading costs by giving a few firms greater leverage in negotiations with both producers and consumers. There is still some time before summer grains are harvested in June, but state purchasers and local agricultural officials need to start preparing now. One possible solution would be to take advantage of the temperature and seasonal differences between northern and southern China and existing equipment-sharing agreements to start shifting mechanized equipment to areas in need earlier this year. The end of the SARS epidemic in 2003 was followed by a period of inflation, marked by a rapid rise in the price of grain. The causes for that inflationary cycle were complex, and not all related to the disease. Still, it showed how a public health emergency can weaken the agricultural market. Agricultural officials need to pay close attention to uncertainties in the supply chain. There is no need to panic or hoard grain at the moment, but there’s also no harm in being prepared for a rainy day.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005454
"Cats, Dogs Caught in Coronavirus Crossfire, Worrying Animal Lovers",Photos circulating on social media claim men in uniforms are capturing — and even killing — stray animals on the streets of Wuhan.,2020-04-10,"Concerns over the mistreatment of stray cats and dogs have been mounting in the central Chinese city of Wuhan amid fears that the animals could catch and transmit the contagious virus that causes COVID-19. According to posts and photos circulating on Chinese social media, some of the city’s residential communities have been “capturing and killing” stray cats and dogs, purportedly to contain the spread of the virus. The posts show men in uniforms capturing the animals, suggesting local authorities may be involved. A Wuhan resident familiar with the matter who requested anonymity told Sixth Tone on Friday that some community compounds in the city’s Dongxihu District had started catching stray canines and felines in the past few weeks. Two of the district’s community compounds — Bandao Lanwan and Baoli Xinyu — launched campaigns against strays in late March and this week, respectively, according to screenshots of posts by community management personnel seen by Sixth Tone. The customer service director at Baoli Xinyu, surnamed Zhong, confirmed to Sixth Tone that the community’s management got on board with capturing stray cats after receiving complaints from residents, citing fears about the animals during the pandemic. However, the community management office has not yet caught any strays, Zhong said.   Coronavirus infections in pets became a concern in February after a COVID-19 patient’s dog in Hong Kong was found with a “low level” of the virus that causes the disease. The city’s Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department said at the time there was no evidence that pets could be a source of human infection. Last month, a cat in Belgium was found to be infected with the coronavirus, transmitted from its sick owner. Authorities in the European country called this an “isolated case,” adding that such cases can be a result of “close contact between animals and infected humans.” However, a new study published Wednesday by the American Association for the Advancement of Science found that ferrets and cats are “permissive to infection” from SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The study also said that cats are susceptible to airborne infection. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has said it is investigating cases involving pets and other animals — including a tiger at a New York zoo — getting infected by their caretakers. “We don't believe that they are playing a role in transmission, but we think that they may be able to be infected from an infected person,” Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 technical lead at the WHO, said during a press conference. An animal welfare volunteer in Wuhan told Sixth Tone he wasn’t aware of, and had not received recent inquiries about, cruelty toward strays due to the coronavirus — though he added that individual community compounds may be leading their own initiatives, as the city’s public security bureaus are only responsible for handling stray dogs, with cats not being included under any regulations. A media spokesperson at the public security bureau in Dongxihu District told Sixth Tone that he was not aware of any recent actions by the bureau to capture strays but added that he would look into the claims circulating online. China has yet to pass a specific law on non-wildlife animal protection, management, and supervision, leaving official protections for pets such as cats up in the air. Disinformation during the pandemic has sown additional fear, the animal welfare volunteer said. “Due to the lack of a specific law (on animal protection), if communities take radical actions, they might only receive moral condemnation,” he said. “It (the problem) has to be tackled at its root.” The lack of clearly stipulated animal rights in China has led to frequent mistreatment of pets, especially cats and dogs. This week, a university student in the eastern Shandong province got off with an apology after reportedly selling videos of cat abuse, resulting in the deaths of 80 felines. And last year, a man in the southern Guangdong province was charged with infringing a dog owner’s property rights after killing their canine companion. However, China’s absent or outdated animal welfare policies may be heading toward a progressive future. This week, the Ministry of Agriculture proposed a list of 31 terrestrial animals that farmers would be allowed to raise for human consumption, while also endorsing dogs as “companions” rather than food. And earlier this month, the southern city of Shenzhen banned the eating of cats and dogs.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005469
Suifenhe Building China’s First Pop-Up Hospital Outside Wuhan,The city in Heilongjiang has seen a sharp rise in imported cases of COVID-19 as Chinese nationals return from neighboring Russia.,2020-04-09,"A city in northeastern China’s Heilongjiang province is enforcing a strict stay-at-home order and has started construction on a quarantine hospital following a sharp increase in coronavirus cases over the past few days.  The county-level city of Suifenhe on Wednesday ordered its 70,000 residents to remain indoors, with each household allowed to send one person out to buy essential items once every three days. The provincial government also sealed off the city’s border with Russia after 45 new COVID-19 cases among returning Chinese nationals were reported on Monday and Tuesday. The first preventive measures in Suifenhe were implemented the same day that the central Chinese city of Wuhan — where the novel coronavirus was first detected — lifted its lockdown after 76 days, following steadily declining numbers of newly reported cases. On Thursday, Heilongjiang’s health department said that Chinese nationals returning from Russia accounted for all 40 of the province’s new cases reported the previous day. As of Tuesday, Heilongjiang had tallied 87 total imported cases. With the number of international flights to and from China now dramatically reduced, more Chinese citizens are opting to enter the country by land. From March 21 to April 7, over 2,400 people passed through the Suifenhe border alone.  Lin Chengzhong, a Suifenhe local who runs a business importing timber from Russia, told Sixth Tone that the small city has always had close ties with its neighbor to the east through the land crossing. In recent years, products such as beer and yogurt have been brought across the border from Russia and sold in China. Lin’s company resumed business in March but had to shut down again just two weeks later, after more imported cases were detected in the province. Though Lin says some residents feel a bit “unsafe,” he’s not yet worried himself. “In my opinion, as the government ramps up efforts to isolate these overseas personnel directly from the port (of entry) and take them to hospitals … there shouldn’t be too many issues,” Lin said. Asymptomatic carriers are one source of concern for Lin, however, as he says he wouldn’t know if he was coming into contact with them. Amid concerns over the spike in infections, Suifenhe on Monday began building a 600-bed quarantine hospital that is scheduled to begin receiving patients on April 11, according to state broadcaster China Central Television. At the end of 2018, the city had six hospitals and health centers with a combined 502 beds and 809 medical workers. On Thursday, sources told Sixth tone’s sister publication The Paper that all imported cases diagnosed in Suifenhe had been transferred to designated hospitals in the nearby city of Mudanjiang, while only asymptomatic carriers will remain in the smaller city. The Suifenhe People’s Hospital — a designated medical facility for COVID-19 patients — was completely closed on Wednesday “due to the need for epidemic prevention and control,” according to the local government. The provincial government, meanwhile, has dispatched a team of 141 medical professionals to Suifenhe and designated more than a dozen hotels as isolation centers for the close contacts of infected patients, according to local authorities. A staff member at Mudanjiang Hongqi Hospital told Sixth Tone that the hospital has also dispatched medical workers to Suifenhe but was not aware of how many. Accompanying the increasing number of COVID-19 patients in Heilongjiang are concerns of dwindling medical supplies. “Supplies of protective materials are very tight,” an unnamed deputy director of Suifenhe People’s Hospital told The Paper on Thursday. “The province is actively procuring (supplies) for us.” The hospital’s stock of hazmat suits will only last up to five more days, the official said, and there is a dire need for N95 surgical masks. A Chinese woman who returned from Moscow and is currently under quarantine at Suifenhe People’s Hospital after developing a fever and cough told The Paper that she was given a nucleic acid test Wednesday and is awaiting a result. She had flown from the Russian capital to the eastern port of Vladivostok on Monday, then continued her journey home the following day on a bus with several other Chinese people. According to the woman, other new arrivals in quarantine have also developed COVID-19 symptoms. She said they haven’t been diagnosed or treated, and that the facilities in the quarantine ward are spartan, with each patient assigned to a room without a toilet. Sixth Tone’s repeated phone calls to the hospital and the provincial health department went unanswered Thursday. Suifenhe’s health bureau referred Sixth Tone to the city’s COVID-19 command center, which referred Sixth Tone to the city’s publicity department. Calls to the department’s media spokesperson, surnamed Shi, went unanswered.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005465
On China’s ‘Color Codes’ and Life After COVID-19,Countries have turned to new technologies to help track citizens’ movements and contain outbreaks. Will they be able to give them up?,2020-04-09,"Nearly half a century ago, the historian William H. McNeill called infectious disease “one of the fundamental parameters and determinants of human history,” a class- and social-leveling crucible capable of forging whole systems and cultures while spurring innovation. Many of these innovations — quarantines being the most obvious example — have focused on a critical question: How can we identify potential carriers and prevent them from spreading disease? With COVID-19 raging through a connected, smartphone-equipped world, it was almost inevitable that societies would turn to digital technology for a modern solution to this problem. Since early February, local officials across China have worked with the development teams behind two of China’s most ubiquitous apps — mobile payment service Alipay and messaging service WeChat — to launch a new kind of virtual passport known variously as a “health code” or “color code.” Although the exact implementation varies by location, the apps generally claim to be able to evaluate the public health risk posed by a given user based on their state-issued ID number, address, travel history, and self-reported health status. They then assign users a corresponding QR code and color: typically green for good-to-go, yellow for a seven-day or shorter quarantine, and red for a 14-day quarantine. Once the system is in place, shops, mass transit stations, and offices may ask residents to show or scan their codes before granting them entry. Over the years, we’ve become accustomed to the sight of cameras peppered throughout public spaces and been trained to robotically click “accept” on online privacy policies. But color codes raise thorny questions about what the post-pandemic world might look like. I worry they could linger on well past this initial crisis, feeding our fears while still claiming to alleviate them. Despite connotations of surveillance, the color code system was actually introduced as a way to relax restrictions on individuals, not tighten them. Traditionally, China has relied on community-based “grid management” to regulate population movement. In the early days of the pandemic, community-level workers and volunteers manually collected personal information from residents and assessed their infection risk. Left to their own devices, grid managers collected a wide range of data, not all of it relevant. According to media reports, residents were sometimes asked less-than-pertinent questions about their marital status, blood type, and even height. Some communities went further, instituting “hardcore” isolation protocols and barring migrants, renters, or those whose ID cards revealed them to be from the outbreak’s epicenter, even if they hadn’t been back in years. The color code system, by contrast, sets a universal standard for information collection, taking the power to assess risks from grassroots units and putting it in the hands of district-level, municipal, or provincial decision-makers. “Showing my color code feels a little more comfortable than having my temperature taken,” a Hangzhou-based tech worker told me. When he returned to the city in early March, his color code was all he needed to enter his residential community — a much lower bar than the temperature checks and travel history interrogations of grid management workers. As for privacy concerns, another resident of Hangzhou, the prominent tech hub in eastern China that was the first city in the country to launch a color code system, argued that the horse has already left the barn. “Our data is already being collected. Scanning a code might make things more convenient,” she said.  I consider myself an optimistic pessimist when it comes to the technology. Like the above-mentioned woman noted, these apps mostly just centralize information scattered throughout the bureaucracy by uploading it all to one database. The real problem with color codes is not the data they’re collecting today, but how they might be used tomorrow. The technology could easily be deployed in contexts where safety was previously taken as a given, forcing us to prove our innocuousness again and again. Fears of terrorism have turned metal detectors and X-ray screenings into a regular part of our daily commutes, but the coronavirus seems to have significantly expanded the scope of the de facto state of emergency we live in. Now that everywhere and everyone is potentially unsafe, residential communities, coffee shops, and offices all feel justified making us prove our health status. The Chinese mainland isn’t the only place embracing technological solutions to pandemic control. Hong Kong has started requiring arrivals in the city to wear tracking wristbands to ensure compliance with quarantine orders; South Korea is using mobile phone applications to map the movements of virus carriers; and the U.S. government has talked to Facebook and Google about using location data to verify whether people are maintaining social distance. The popularity of these and other measures being taken around the world is characteristic of what sociologist Ulrich Beck termed the “risk society,” a society mobilized in never-ending struggles against uncertain threats ranging from nuclear disaster to terrorism. Risk societies shape more than just our institutions. They frame peoples’ minds, stimulating a bottomless appetite for security and safety, while convincing them to grant institutions and technologies ever-greater powers in the name of keeping them safe. As Beck — and later the sociologist Niklas Luhmann — have argued, risk societies have a way of spawning new threats. Prioritizing security and safety above all else comes at a cost. The basic logic of digital risk management is to label individuals and convert them into analyzable data. Yet for all their high-tech veneer, these projects often mimic our own prejudices and blind spots. For example, color codes were used to govern who could leave the central city of Wuhan after it ended its quarantine on Wednesday. But at least one reporter found that reliance on the system left many residents without smartphones, even those with official documents attesting to their health, unable to board trains out of the city. Fears, once stoked, also rarely dissolve. Three decades ago, the Chinese government barred hepatitis B carriers from working in jobs deemed health-sensitive, including as food servers. Over the years, however, more and more employers across every level of society began requiring applicants to be tested for the disease. It took a wave of lawsuits for the government to ban the practice, and even then, it lingered on in some places. There are already signs of a mission creep in the color codes system. China’s gated communities have been among the most zealous in implementing containment measures. Yet, even as life has gradually returned to normal and local governments have lowered emergency response levels, many of these “cities within cities” have proven reluctant to drop unnecessary checks on visitors. Tech companies interested in competing for government contracts have strong incentives to play along. In recent years, government officials and bureaucrats have sought to rebrand themselves as efficient and tech-savvy, and color codes are just the latest example in a private-public partnership that has produced “smart campus” programs, the widespread adaptation of facial recognition, and the digitization of many government databases and services. These commercial incentives don’t disappear when a crisis does: After the current pandemic fades, sellers will rack their brains to identify and publicize the next threat, even if that means perpetuating feelings of risk and danger. According to a notice issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China in February, the collection of personal information for the purpose of disease prevention should “be kept to a strict minimum” and must “generally avoid targeting people in a specific area to prevent de facto discrimination.” The Chinese government should give clearer signals that these outbreak monitoring systems are temporary expedients and should be used only for their original purpose: facilitating movement and freeing people from cumbersome health checks. Companies should be required to disclose the criteria used for assigning red, yellow, or green codes; to limit the circumstances under which the codes may be used; and to ensure the systems — and the relevant data — are discarded once the outbreak is over. This pandemic — knock on wood — will pass. Yet it won’t truly be behind us until we also put aside the fear caused by the coronavirus and the over-regulation of individuals brought on by that fear. And that means no more color-coding people according to their so-called risk levels.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005452
"On TikTok, Wuhan’s COVID-19 Survivors Gather to Share Their Pain","As she recovered from the coronavirus, Zhu Hong started sharing her story on social media. Within days, thousands of other patients followed her, wanting to discuss their own traumas.",2020-04-09,"HUBEI, Central China — It’s Tuesday evening in Wuhan. In three hours, the city is set to finally lift its lockdown — marking a new stage in its slow recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak that brought life here to a standstill in January. As she kicks off her show on TikTok, however, Zhu Hong focuses on a personal piece of news. “My mother-in-law did an antibody test today, and it showed her body’s producing antibodies (against the coronavirus),” the 40-year-old tells her viewers. “We don’t need to worry about her going out and getting infected again.”  Zhu has been livestreaming on the Chinese version of the social media platform — known as Douyin inside China — every night since late March, sharing the ups and downs of her family’s battle against the virus, encouraging her followers to do the same. “When I was depressed, fearing I might die just like my father-in-law, I received encouragement from doctors and other patients,” she says. “Now, I want to give it back to you.”  The show has quickly become a hit in Wuhan, as the city’s 11 million inhabitants try to process the collective trauma they’ve experienced and find a way to return to normal life. On Tuesday evening, several thousand people join the broadcast, with Zhu fielding questions from a range of recovering patients. An elderly woman who says she’s been experiencing depression asks how she can cheer herself up. “I’m sure you have more methods than me, because you’re more experienced in life,” answers Zhu. Others say they’ve fully recovered from the virus but still haven’t left their bedrooms, as they’re terrified of infecting their families. Zhu tells them to try wearing a mask and talking to their families from a distance at first. “If you stay in your room every day, it’ll be like a prison for you, and you’ll eventually get sick,” she says. The Wuhan native is far from a typical livestreamer: She’s a jade dealer by trade. Before the pandemic, she and her husband regularly traveled to the city of Ruili, on China’s border with Myanmar, where they bought precious stones to sell in their hometown. The TikTok account Zhu now uses was originally set up by her husband to advertise his newest jades and woodcarvings. But everything changed for the couple in early January, after Zhu’s father-in-law came down with a mysterious illness and developed a high fever.  On Jan. 9, Zhu and her mother-in-law took the 68-year-old to the hospital, expecting the doctors to advise them on how to bring down his temperature. To their astonishment, he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and put on a ventilator. Three days later, his condition was declared critical, the physician informing the family that he had suffered multiple organ failure. Zhu’s husband flew back to Wuhan from Ruili immediately. On Jan. 17, Zhu’s father-in-law died on the operating table. “It was a shock,” Zhu tells Sixth Tone. “It never occurred to us that a cold would kill him.” The doctor said the cause of death was severe pneumonia and that people die every year of pneumonia with unknown causes. “No one told us it was infectious, and the medical workers weren’t wearing face masks,” says Zhu. The same day, Zhu developed a cough and her mother-in-law started to feel short of breath. Worried, they both underwent CT scans, which showed their lungs were infected.  When the pair’s blood test results arrived on Jan. 19, doctors requested their family members leave the hospital at once. “By then, the doctors knew what disease it was, and they were worried about human-to-human transmission,” says Zhu. “I was scared and couldn’t stop crying, especially at night when it was cold. I noticed doctors starting to wear protective equipment, and I knew things were getting serious.” Wuhan’s health commission maintained there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission for weeks during the early stages of the pandemic. The Chinese public finally heard confirmation that the disease was infectious Jan. 21, when renowned epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster China Central Television that human-to-human transmission was “definite.” Zhu was finally discharged from the hospital after 12 days, with doctors ordering her to self-isolate at home for another two weeks. She stayed in her bedroom, her parents passing her meals through the door. It was during this period that Zhu began posting short videos on TikTok, documenting her recovery in the hospital and then her daily life during isolation. The videos appeared to resonate with other COVID-19 patients. Zhu soon attracted thousands of followers, and many started asking her for advice — from where to get antibody tests in Wuhan, to how to cope with the fear from their neighbors.  After a few weeks, she decided to start livestreaming so she could talk to her fans directly. She felt she might be able to offer them psychological support. “After all, sharing from patients is more empathetic,” she says. The first few shows, however, were “awkward,” Zhu says. Few viewers were willing to speak, and so she’d often fill the pauses by talking about her own life. Later, she realized her followers from Wuhan were staying silent because they were afraid of receiving verbal abuse. She encouraged all her fans to open up to each other. “Now it’s getting better every night, and I get to see so many familiar names,” says Zhu. “They (my Wuhan-based followers) saw that non-Wuhanese patients care about them … and little by little they started to show up and ask questions.”  According to Zhu, the most common questions she receives are about the difficulties recovered patients face as they try to resume normal life. Many of her followers fear dealing with discrimination from people outside Wuhan, while others struggle psychologically to move on. For many COVID-19 survivors in Wuhan, recovery is a slow, painful process. Fu Jun, a 37-year-old COVID-19 patient, tells Sixth Tone he often feels anxious and struggles to sleep at night. “It’s the first time I’ve experienced such a life-and-death situation, and I can’t let it go yet,” he says. The Wuhan native, who lives just 2 kilometers from the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the earliest coronavirus cases emerged, started feeling under-the-weather in late January. A few days later, his father started showing similar symptoms. Fu accompanied his father to Wuhan Central Hospital Jan. 31. After a 10-hour wait, they finally saw a doctor, and Fu’s father was given a CT scan. The results did not look good. “He said there wasn’t a treatment for now and suggested we go home and self-isolate,” says Fu. The scene inside the hospital that day still haunts Fu. “It was jammed with patients who couldn’t breathe well,” he recalls. “And they were wailing.” Fu’s father couldn’t be admitted as an inpatient without a positive nucleic acid test, but Wuhan had a severe shortage of testing kits. “Many patients were prevented from being hospitalized, just like my father, back then,” says Fu.  Two days later, Fu’s father died of respiratory failure. The cause of death wasn’t counted as COVID-19 at the time. “My father had always been in good shape,” says Fu. “At first, we only paid attention to the spread of the epidemic, and never expected the disease would hit our own family.” On Feb. 7, Fu found out he himself had tested positive for COVID-19. “It was like a blow to the head,” he says. At midnight, he was taken to a designated hotel to be quarantined. Two weeks later, he was transferred to a makeshift hospital — or fangcang — where he stayed until March 12. At first, Fu felt confident about his health, saying he felt few symptoms. But after he failed a second nucleic acid test, he started to worry that he was going to die. “I felt so down,” he says.  Following a second stint in a quarantine hotel, Fu was eventually allowed to return home March 27. He was far from overjoyed, however. Like many recovered patients, he feared infecting others, especially his recently widowed mother. “To be honest, I didn’t want to be discharged,” he says. “Was the test result really positive or negative?” Zhu shares this anxiety. Nearly two months after her isolation period ended, she and her family — her husband, parents, and 12-year-old daughter — remain healthy, but she continues to practice social distancing. “I still eat separately from them,” Zhu tells her viewers during her Tuesday show. “It’s better to be cautious, as there’s no final word on this disease yet.” On April 1, the QR code on Zhu’s health-tracking app finally turned green, indicating she’s no longer considered a public health risk. Since then, Zhu has started to go for occasional strolls around the housing complex where she lives. But her emotional recovery is an ongoing process. She tells her followers that she still dreams about her illness. Sometimes, she also has flashbacks and feels overwhelmed with sadness. “But it’s very temporary,” she adds.  Both Fu and Zhu tell Sixth Tone they’re keen to help other COVID-19 patients. Apart from her TikTok show, Zhu has volunteered to donate blood plasma at Jinyintan Hospital, a facility in Wuhan that treats patients in severe and critical condition. In February, the hospital urged recovered patients to give blood, as it contains large numbers of antibodies against the virus. Early trials indicate that injecting the plasma into severely ill patients could help them fight off the disease. For Zhu, the idea that her blood could help people in need is a source of comfort. “I’ve experienced the pain of feeling helpless and hopeless to save my father-in-law,” says Zhu. “But I feel that now my efforts can really save a life and a family.” On March 31, Fu took a blood test, hoping to become a plasma donor, too. But the hospital turned him down, as he’s suffering from chest pains. “It’s a pity for me,” he says. “I believe many people who have gone through this are willing to help others if they can.” .

Can Blockchain Fix China’s Broken Public Health Emergency System?,A blockchain specialist argues that the technology could help solve some of the problems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-04-08,"This article is part of an ongoing series in which experts will analyze the role of science and technology in epidemic response and control in China and around the world. It took almost four months, but China’s frenzied initial battle against the coronavirus appears to be drawing to a close. The virus, which gradually spread through the central city of Wuhan from late last year before developing into a global pandemic, offered a harsh lesson in the flaws in the country’s current public health emergency response system. Now that we have a little breathing room, perhaps it’s time to look back and reexamine what worked and what didn’t: How can we improve or even rebuild our public health emergency management systems to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future? Nearly everyone — from doctors and scientists to journalists and ordinary citizens — has been reckoning with these issues since the first alarm bells began to sound late last December. After a deadly outbreak of another coronavirus-caused disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in the early 2000s, China spent heavily on an “automated” early warning system for infectious diseases. The system worked reasonably well for a string of regional outbreaks over the years, but the current pandemic has highlighted problems in its practical application, including lengthy review processes, susceptibility to outside interference, and a lack of transparency. Nor were the problems limited to the alert system. Government departments also struggled to coordinate and share information. For all of China’s investment in big data and tracking technology, the early days of the outbreak saw key officials trying to track potentially infected travelers by posting missing persons notices on social media. The combination of insufficient information, irregular management practices, poor transparency, inadequate accountability, and flimsy guarantees about the authenticity of donated materials together hampered the disbursal and use of vital protective gear and other materials, undermining the public’s confidence in epidemic control work. In short, COVID-19 has accentuated defects in data-sharing and collaboration at all levels of the public health emergency management system. To address these problems, it’s necessary to break through the barriers between departments and establish a new model for data governance, one which is open, transparent, and capable of protecting citizens’ privacy and security. That’s where blockchain technology comes in. Although most often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, blockchain is in essence a kind of public ledger: a collectively maintained online database. Data stored on the blockchain cannot be easily altered, and compared with traditional databases, decentralized blockchain networks offer increased anonymity, data encryption, and tamper protection, as well as the benefits of distributed storage and multiple fail-safes. In fact, blockchain — together with another field getting some buzz, big data — are already in use in the fight against the pandemic. A consortium of tech companies, including Micro Doctor, AliHealth, and DXY, have used the technologies to build a “virtual front line” capable of monitoring the pandemic in real time. Meanwhile, my team at Wuhan University developed a national information exchange platform for personal protective equipment. We upload information about requests and material donations to the blockchain. After verification, we have a reliable database for users — donors, hospitals, and clinics, among others — to look up what’s needed and what’s available. These and other, similar projects show how blockchain technology can be used to build a new epidemic early warning mechanism, one protected from human interference, capable of providing timely and accurate information, and coordinated across departmental lines. Right now, key information is separated into departmental silos, but using blockchain to link the health authorities, hospitals, key charities, and public security apparatus could help increase the integration and sharing of epidemic data and enhance emergency management efficiency. Along with this, it could also allow for more transparent information that’s open to all. Of course, some sensitive information may not be suited for public release. Blockchain technology allows for safeguards to be put in place using keys and permissions, which can limit access to a certain class of users. Blockchain is not expensive — the core technology and software platforms are free — and my co-author and I believe it will become integral to the construction of public health emergency management systems in the future. In the short term, the primary challenge will be teaching people how to use it. Given its wide applicability — not just in health, but in finance and other fields — colleges and universities should start training specialists in order to meet the expected demand.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005449

At midnight on April 8, the blockade at the Gongjialing toll station — one of the major arteries connecting Wuhan with other cities in Hubei province — was dismantled and removed. A few days prior, Hankou Railway Station began welcoming travelers back to the city, and from Wednesday, passenger trains have the green light to depart from Wuhan.

"Lockdown Lifted: After 76 Days, Wuhan Stirs Back to Life","For the first time since January, people in the Chinese city hardest-hit by COVID-19 are being allowed to leave.",2020-04-08,"HUBEI, Central China — As the Jianghanguan clock tower in Wuhan struck midnight on Wednesday, police began pushing aside the highway roadblocks that had cut the city off from its surroundings for the past two months. When the traffic lights at one toll station turned green, hundreds of cars lurched toward the gates, marking an end to over two months of lockdown in Wuhan, the city at the heart of China’s COVID-19 outbreak. “I got here at around 10:30 (Tuesday evening), so I’m pretty close to the toll station,” Li Qing, a Wuhan native waiting in line near the Qinglong toll gate north of the city, tells Sixth Tone. “There are only about 20 cars ahead of me, but the line behind me runs 2 or 3 kilometers long.” Along with her husband, the 35-year-old sales associate is bound for the eastern city of Huai’an, in Jiangsu province, where she works. On a normal day with sparse traffic, the drive would take about six hours. “After 70 days, we can finally leave. I’m very excited,” Li says. “The city can’t stay sealed off forever — we need to go to work.”  Wuhan authorities announced a citywide lockdown on Jan. 23, after 17 deaths and 571 coronavirus infections were reported in over two dozen provinces on the Chinese mainland. The measure cut off all transport links within, into, and out of the city — including buses, subways, ferries, flights, and trains — in a bid to contain the outbreak. As the number of local infections has declined, authorities in Hubei, where Wuhan is located, have gradually relaxed travel restrictions enforced across the province. On March 18, Hubei’s coronavirus task force ordered cities, prefectures, and counties to remove all traffic barriers except those surrounding Wuhan and bordering neighboring provinces. Hubei residents from cities other than Wuhan were allowed to leave the city, provided they could show a green code on their government-backed health tracker app or a health certificate issued by their residential community. In addition, they were also required to obtain a document issued by authorities at their destination confirming that they would be returning to their place of residence or work. On March 24, the provincial COVID-19 task force announced that Wuhan would be unsealed on Apr. 8. Beginning the day after the notice, residents who needed to return to work outside the city could be “sent to their destinations precisely,” provided they could show a green health-tracking code and had tested negative for the coronavirus. Li Xudong is waiting to catch the first train departing from Wuhan’s Hankou Railway Station at 6:25 a.m. to Jingzhou, a city around 220 kilometers from the provincial capital. “I have to be at work by 8:30, so that’s why I’m taking this early train,” Li, 57, tells Sixth Tone. He had come to Wuhan to join his son’s family for the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, just before the citywide lockdown order. “I’m very excited to leave after having been stuck in the city for over 70 days,” he says. The train will leave Wuhan carrying around 60 passengers, according to Yu Yueru, an official at the station. Altogether, some 21,000 people are leaving by train from Hankou station on Wednesday, Yu tells Sixth Tone. An unnamed representative of China Railway Wuhan Group told The Beijing News that as of Tuesday, around 55,000 people had booked train tickets out of Wuhan for the first day of the lifted lockdown. “I’m finally going home,” a passenger from Jingzhou surnamed Fang tells Sixth Tone. Fang had gone to the northern port city of Tianjin, where her daughter’s family lives, in late January — but because she would have had to transfer in Wuhan to get back to Jingzhou, she wound up stuck in Tianjin. “I’m very happy to go home and be reunited with my family,” Fang says. Taxi services in Wuhan also resumed Wednesday, after the city’s public transportation, including subway and bus lines, were gradually restored since late March. Within Wuhan, however, ubiquitous blue and yellow barriers around residential compounds will largely remain in place, according to local authorities. The decision is intended to help prevent a COVID-19 rebound driven by asymptomatic carriers of the virus, discharged patients who later test positive again, and imported cases, according to a government document seen by Sixth Tone. “Don’t leave (the city) unless it’s necessary,” the document said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005455
China to Bring Under-18 Students Home From US,"The Chinese Embassy has said that minors studying in the U.S. will be prioritized for repatriation flights based on age, with youngest served first.",2020-04-07,"China is planning to repatriate its underage students in the United States as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise. In a statement Monday, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. said it is gauging students’ interest in returning to their homeland, as many still remain in their host country. The embassy added that it is specifically focusing on minors, as they may face “practical difficulties” in their daily lives amid the pandemic. “If temporary flights and chartered flights are arranged, priority will be given to minors based on the order of their ages,” the statement said. There are more than 400,000 Chinese citizens studying in the U.S., and more than 90% of them are still in the country, according to a separate statement from the Chinese Embassy on Friday. The students would be required to pay for the repatriation flight and follow quarantine protocol at their destination in China, according to the embassy. While the official number of coronavirus cases in China has steadily declined, with zero deaths reported Monday, the equivalent number in the U.S. has been sharply rising. As of Tuesday, there were more than 360,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and over 10,000 deaths. On March 28, China banned foreigners — including those with valid visas and work permits — from entering the country. The move was supposedly aimed at curbing imported infections, even though returning Chinese nationals were responsible for the vast majority of such cases. Liu Jin, an official with the Ministry of Education, said last week that only 180,000 of China’s 1.6 million students abroad have returned during the pandemic. The Chinese Embassy in the U.K. had scheduled a chartered flight departing last Thursday for less than 200 underage Chinese students who had yet to leave the country, after more than 160 families petitioned the embassy in mid-March for help sending their children home.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005450
"To Halt COVID-19, Protect Renters",Renters continue to lack the same urban rights and protections as homeowners. That divide has never made less than in the middle of a pandemic.,2020-04-07,"This February, not long after an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan had become a national epidemic, my local neighborhood committee in Shanghai posted a notice informing residents how to register for the chance to buy face masks. There was a catch, however. To register, residents had to present not just their state-issued ID card, but also their property deed. Renters without deeds were ineligible. As COVID-19 spread, it accentuated long-standing fault lines in Chinese society — between rural and urban, migrant and local. Renters, too, have faced unexpected challenges. In order to control population flow and keep the virus outside their borders, many cities have restricted or discouraged renters from returning from their Lunar New Year vacations, regardless of their health status. Local officials in the eastern city of Kunshan required renters from any of seven at-risk provinces to be repatriated. And a neighborhood in southwestern city Chengdu announced that, if renters wanted to return home, they and their landlord would each have to pay a 500,000 yuan ($70,600) deposit. Homeowners, on the other hand, were generally free from such restrictions, their deeds proof that they belonged. To understand this imbalance of rights between renters and homeowners, it’s important to look past current efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which are merely a manifestation and demonstration of how urban housing rights work. “Homeowner” is a relatively new identity in China, though it is constantly reaffirmed and strengthened by the workings of everyday life. Homeownership here does not simply imply having a house to live in and a home to return to, it’s associated with group identity, class identity, and social status. And behind these associations, it indicates preferential access to certain rights. In the early years of the People’s Republic of China, the country managed, allocated, and controlled housing for urban residents through a system of public housing. Beginning with the “reform and opening-up” push in 1978, however, market forces gradually made their way into the housing sector. Twenty years later, in 1998, the country abolished its public housing distribution system. Homeownership soon became an important class marker, conferring access to coveted public services or other benefits. During the 1990s, cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin implemented a “blue seal residency permit” system to stimulate the housing market. Under this system, people from other cities only needed to buy a house in the city to receive the same preferential treatment permanent residents enjoyed, like spots in kindergartens and public school systems, the ability to apply for a business license, and the right to install gas and telephone lines. The “blue seal” system has since been phased out, but homeownership remains closely linked with access to the best urban public resources. Meanwhile, surging house prices mean that homes now make up three-quarters on average of Chinese household assets, a much higher figure than in other countries. All told, homeownership in China is an important measure of family wealth, class identity, and urban identity, and it’s become commonplace for two or even three generations of a family to pool their wealth to buy property. In this stratified system, renters receive unequal treatment, including when it comes to their children’s educational rights. In order to solve this problem, promote the development of the rental market, and ease the housing market bubble, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development announced in 2017 that it would pass legislation clearly delineating the duties of landlords, safeguarding their lawful rights and interests, and systematizing lease periods and rental fees. The ministry’s intention was to gradually grant renters the same access to public services as property owners. Yet the above-mentioned policy remains in the draft stage, and even if it is a step in the right direction, there is still a long way to go before owners and renters enjoy the same rights. When the southern city of Guangzhou first introduced a policy of equal rights for renters and buyers in 2017, it stipulated that the children of homeowners and renters alike would enjoy equal access to nearby schools. However, in practice, the children of renters are still given lower priority than those of homeowning families in the city’s top school districts. These divisions have been highlighted by the pandemic. As the virus raged, a lack of property rights saw renters being expelled from their homes and forced to either find temporary accommodations or return to their hometowns. Ostensibly, this was done for local epidemic control purposes, yet renters sometimes also found themselves left out of other epidemic control efforts, as in the case of my neighborhood’s face mask distribution system. COVID-19 presents a high risk of human-to-human transmission, so it’s understandable that communities would take measures to protect vulnerable groups. However, treating people differently according to whether or not they own real estate in the city, or whether or not they are “locals,” is not the answer. When people live in the same neighborhood and contribute to the same city yet are treated differently, it heightens social divisions and causes conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a litmus test for the rights of renters and owners in Chinese cities, and as such, it gives us an opportunity to reflect on their implementation. Overcoming this disease will require us to stick together: The coronavirus doesn’t discriminate on the basis of property ownership, and neither should we.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005448
Life Between Wuhan’s Thin Yellow Lines,"After the city went into lockdown, officials erected barriers to keep residents off the streets. As the threat receded, however, a photojournalist noticed cracks begin to appear.",2020-04-06,"Editor’s note: Gerry Yin is a photojournalist who has spent the past seven weeks reporting from the central city of Wuhan. When I arrived in Wuhan on Feb. 16, my eyes were immediately drawn to the bright yellow barriers I saw everywhere I went. Erected days prior in an attempt to cut off transmission of COVID-19, they had transformed the city into an archipelago of walled-off residential compounds. It was an eye-catching defense for an invisible foe. At first, I saw the barriers as symbols, yellow warnings of the city’s confinement. What went on behind them was a mystery: They were almost exactly the height of the average adult male, meaning you had no idea who, if anyone, was on the other side. Yet even in a pandemic, life goes on, and walls can’t keep people apart indefinitely. As the city brought the outbreak under control, residents started to break through the barriers that separated them — sometimes literally, using drills.   A few scenes stick out in my mind: a smoker shouting over the wall to the owner of a grocery store on the other side: “A pack of Yellow Crane Towers, please!” Nothing happened for a few seconds, then a hand appeared over the barrier, clutching the store’s payment code. Then there was the middle-aged woman dressed head-to-toe in pajamas directing a delivery driver from her window. After getting him where she wanted, she lowered a clothes hook down and snagged her order without ever leaving her windowsill. Wuhan is set to lift its lockdown on Wednesday — a sign that the worst may finally be over. The walls still stand as I write this, but residents are increasingly allowed to leave their compounds for work or to purchase groceries.For my part, I no longer associate the barriers only with fear, but also with life, vitality, and the ingenuity of ordinary Wuhanese. The cracks in the city’s yellow walls are growing, and our lives expanding to fill them.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005442
"Ahead of Lockdown’s End, a Soft Reopening for Wuhan Businesses","As the virus-stricken city prepares to lift its lockdown, shopkeepers are anxious to make up for lost time.",2020-04-05,"HUBEI, Central China — After over two months spent cooped up at home, shopkeepers in Hubei’s coronavirus-ravaged capital Wuhan are cautiously reopening their doors. Museums, parks, and tourist sites remain shut, but intracity public transit links, including most bus lines and the city’s subway, are back in service. Vendors and hawkers have reappeared, shopping malls are slowly reopening, and mask-clad residents are trickling back onto the city’s streets. On Jan. 23, local officials effectively put Wuhan into quarantine, cutting it off from the outside world and shutting down public spaces and nonessential businesses in an attempt to contain a deadly outbreak of COVID-19 in the city. With the lockdown set to be formally lifted Wednesday, the past few days have witnessed a soft relaunch of sorts. Yet interviews with retailers and vendors suggest that it may be a long road back to business as usual, as sellers must navigate fears of a “second wave” of infections and the economic fallout of 10 weeks of commercial inactivity. World City Plaza, one of the largest shopping malls in the Wuhan tech cluster known as “Optics Valley,” reopened Thursday. Mall staff were back at their posts, and a few merchants could be seen sorting through their stock. “We’re making preparations and warming up for the official opening (on Wednesday),” menswear shop manager Zhang Yehong told Sixth Tone. “We closed the store before the Lunar New Year, so many of our items are from the winter collection. There’s a lot to be done.” According to Zhang, prior to the lockdown, hundreds of shoppers a day would pass through her store. In her first day back, however, customers were few and far between. “It’s hard to say when we’ll be back (to normal). We’ll have to see what happens after (the city) fully reopens on April 8,” Zhang said. “Many residential compounds are still keeping people from leaving.” A number of shopkeepers told Sixth Tone that they’d noticed a change in customer attitudes. “Now, people come in with a specific demand,” a shop assistant at a cosmetics store, surnamed Xu, said. “They get what they need and get out.” The shift may be related to concerns over a potential resurgence of COVID-19. Although the city has reported just two cases — one asymptomatic, the other imported from abroad — over the past week, worries persist that asymptomatic carriers could spark a second wave of infection. While experts have sought to calm fears, some stores in the city are trying to assuage customer concerns through so-called touch-free shopping. A shopping mall in Wuhan’s Jianghan district told local media last week that all of its clothing stores will disinfect items each time they are tried on, and that customers using cash or their bank cards to pay will be required to pass them back and forth on trays. Malls aren’t the only places struggling to adjust to life post-coronavirus. The city’s street vendors, whose thin margins make them vulnerable to downturns, say they are anxious to earn back some of the time and money they lost during the lockdown.   Zhou Jianguo, who runs a snack and bottled water stand on a pedestrian shopping street near World City Plaza, opened his business Thursday for the first time in over two months. But he’s spent most of the days since watching TV on his phone. “This place used to be the busiest in Wuchang (District),” the 56-year-old told Sixth Tone. “I don't think (a recovery) is possible in less than a month.” Zhou pays over 7,000 yuan ($987) a quarter to rent his stall. Although not cheap, he says the location is usually worth it: The pedestrian street he is on is popular with both students and tourists. Now, however, the expensive rent worries him. “We weren’t open, but the rent still has to be paid,” said Zhou. “Without customers, (my family) will have no income. We’ll have to live off our savings.”  Zhou hopes sales will rebound when in-person classes start again and foot traffic returns to his street. When that will be is not clear. Although Wuhan’s lockdown is set to be lifted Wednesday, local officials have not yet given a firm date for when schools can reopen their doors. On his first day back, Zhou said he earned a little over 300 yuan — his first income in two months. “Being able to go out makes me feel better. Whether you have customers or not, at least you can move around,” Zhou said. “It’s better than staying inside.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005440
"In Wuhan, Sirens and Silence","On a national day of mourning, the city at the heart of China’s COVID-19 outbreak reflected on what was lost.",2020-04-04,"HUBEI, Central China — For three minutes this morning, car horns blared, air-raid sirens echoed, and residents across Wuhan stood in silence, as a battered city grieved for the lives lost in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Similar scenes took place across China Saturday, one day after the central government announced the country would observe a national day of mourning on April 4. Timed to coincide with Tomb-Sweeping Day, a traditional festival for Chinese to honor and make sacrifices to the dead, a nationwide three-minute moment of silence was held at 10 a.m., and all flags in the country and at Chinese embassies around the world were ordered lowered to half-mast. The national day of mourning is the first since 2010, when a massive landslide in the northwestern Gansu province killed at least 1,480 people. As of Friday, over 3,300 people in China have died of COVID-19, according to official figures. Over 75% of them were here, in Wuhan, a transit hub on the banks of the Yangtze River where the first cases of the then still-unidentified disease were reported late last year. “So many people have died in our country, it’s devastating,” 39-year-old Wuhan resident Mei Xinghua told Sixth Tone Saturday.  Mei had come to the city’s riverside Yiyuan Square with his wife and daughter to watch a provincial government-organized memorial to those killed by the disease. Unable to enter the square, which was closed to the public, the three did their best to take in the ceremony from across the street. “I came here for everyone (who died), but especially for my late cousin,” he said. Mei’s cousin, actually a distant relative, was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan’s Central Hospital before dying of COVID-19 in early March. On Thursday, Mei Zhongming was one of 14 people, along with his co-worker, whistleblower Li Wenliang, to be honored as martyrs by the Hubei government. The scene outside Central Hospital was quiet on Saturday morning, and the entire complex remained surrounded by the city’s ubiquitous yellow and blue barricades, erected as part of a more than two-month-old citywide lockdown. According to a report from domestic outlet Caixin, more than 230 of Central’s 4,000 employees contracted COVID-19, making it one of the hardest-hit medical facilities in Wuhan. “The hospital’s clinic will reopen on Apr. 6, so we’re disinfecting,” a man who identified himself as a hospital employee told Sixth Tone. All three of the national flags in front of the building had been lowered to half-mast.  At around 9:40 a.m., a 24-year-old Wuhan resident, dressed head-to-toe in protective gear, arrived at the hospital to drop off a traditional memorial bouquet of yellow and white chrysanthemums . The woman, who did not give her name, showed Sixth Tone a card she had attached to the flowers: “Deep condolences to the martyrs Li Wenliang, Jiang Xueqing, Mei Zhongming, Zhu Heping, and Liu Li. Your 1.4 billion compatriots will remember!” The names are those of Central Hospital staff known to have died from COVID-19. “They (the medical workers) have left us, but we will remember them,” she told a group of reporters gathered outside the hospital. “They’re the ones who blew the whistle.” “I want to say that residents don’t have short memories,” she added. “We remembered in February, we still remember now in April, and we will remember in the future.” Other residents have focused their energies on the survivors. A preschool teacher in the city, surnamed Deng, told Sixth Tone she has been sending postcards and images to some of the thousands of medical workers from around the country who arrived in the city at the height of the outbreak to relieve its overwhelmed hospitals. “My heart is heavy,” Deng said, explaining that she and other volunteers like her wanted to tell these doctors and nurses, most of whom have since returned to their home cities, that Wuhan was recovering. “Many doctors and nurses sacrificed their lives for people they didn’t even know. I don’t know how to express my gratitude,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005439
"This Qingming, a Time to Weep, a Time to Mourn","Memorials and official remembrances are important, but so is giving people space to grieve and process.",2020-04-04,"Tomb-Sweeping Day feels a little different this year. In normal times, Chinese commemorate the holiday, also known as Qingming Festival, by going to the countryside and cleaning their ancestors’ graves. In the midst of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, however, officials worried about transmission risks in large crowds have tried to dissuade people from taking part in on-site tomb-sweeping. Instead, many public cemeteries are advertising services like online tomb-sweeping or paid third-party tomb-sweeping. The issue is even more pointed in the central Hubei province, and especially its capital, Wuhan. The region’s three-month-long battle with the coronavirus — including two months of near-total lockdown — cost thousands of lives. And because COVID-19 is infectious, many family members were denied a final farewell to the bodies of their loved ones, which were quickly cremated. When Wuhan’s funeral parlors and cemeteries reopened in late March, and residents were finally allowed to pick up the ashes of those they had lost, they had lines that sometimes stretched out the door. How do you even start to address all this pent-up grief? Burials, funerals, and other rituals after major disasters are a way to say farewell to the dead, console the living, and heal the wounds of personal and collective pain. They shape our memories of the event into a shared social legacy; they can be a lesson, a warning, and a source of emotional encouragement or spiritual motivation. They also generally come in two kinds: personal and collective. The former generally consist of things like burials and family-centric sacrificial ceremonies, such as making food offerings or kowtowing in front of memorials at home. The collective are generally orchestrated top-down and tend to focus on memorials or public services. Both are necessary, but the way we commemorate disasters must be attentive to the thoughts and needs of the people most affected. Traditional Chinese custom designates a three-step ritual for remembering the dead: mourning, burial, and memorial. The body of the deceased is usually kept at home for three days, during which mourners can offer condolences, then hold a funeral procession and burial. Family sacrifices are made every seven days up to the 49th day — the so-called the seventh seven. After that they become yearly occurrences, such as on the anniversary of the person’s death and on Tomb-Sweeping Day.  While there are folk religious components to this, like lighting a changming lamp or burning paper money to ensure the dead can smoothly pass into the other world, the way these rituals help the living break free from the shadow of the deceased and come to terms with the reality of death are important, even to the nonreligious. For years, the Chinese government had its own three-step process for commemorating natural disasters: catastrophe, rescue, and expressions of gratitude. Wang Xiaokui, an academic specializing in disasters and folklore has pointed to the deadly Tangshan earthquake, which killed at least 240,000 people in July 1976, as an example. In the quake’s aftermath, official media focused on residents’ “anti-earthquake spirit” and their gratitude to the Communist Party of China for leading the relief work. Compared with the situation now, there was less space given to individual expressions of grief. At the time, the state viewed traditional sacrifices and burial services as part of the country’s feudal past, and the severe damage the quake caused meant the dead were buried quickly, often in unmarked graves. Meanwhile, those who had lost relatives or loved ones in the disaster quietly burned offerings of paper money on silent streets. Over the years, these individual expressions of memory and mourning persisted in the city, especially on Tomb-Sweeping Day and the anniversary of the earthquake, July 28. Eventually, a private company spied a business opportunity and unveiled a memorial wall on which residents could carve the names of those they lost — provided they paid a fee. Despite the project’s crass commercialism, the company received thousands of orders from people looking for a place they could visit, touch their loved ones’ names and cry. Finally, in 2008, the local government ordered the project torn down and unveiled a free wall of its own, in a move Wang saw as indicative of changing official attitudes toward grief and death. Nevertheless, state-backed collective memorial rituals in China still tend to frame events through the lens of grand, patriotic narratives. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall and similar institutions press visitors to “never forget the national humiliation.” Memorials to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, meanwhile, offer popular science lessons about earthquakes while emphasizing the successes of post-disaster reconstruction efforts. Disease outbreaks are slightly different: It’s difficult to pin down a definite date or choose a specific site for the memorial. Mainstream commemorations of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome primarily consist of documentaries, retrospectives, and similar projects. Yet the emphasis remains on the nation’s mobilization, its united struggle to control the outbreak, and the legacy of the fight. This time, the official narrative has likewise described the situation as a “war” against the virus, one waged by an ostensibly homogenous society: a determined government, brave doctors, and steadfast civilians. On April 3, the authorities announced the country would observe a national day of mourning, timed to coincide with Tomb-Sweeping Day. The previous day, the Hubei government honored 14 victims of the virus, including the once-reprimanded whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, as “martyrs.” Holding a national day of mourning or building a statue to Li Wenliang – as one Hubei politician has called for – can be valid way to commemorate a disaster, but it’s also vital to provide a means for traumatized individuals to vent their emotions, find hope, and preserve personal or “unauthorized” memories. Some already exist, like Li Wenliang’s last Weibo microblog post. Netizens have turned it into a “tree hollow,” a place where they can spill their thoughts, leaving him more than 750,000 comments. Some thank him and say they miss him, while others tell him Wuhan has finally contained the virus and wish him peace. One may share feelings of bewilderment and pain; another may talk about Li’s courage. Our emotions and recollections from the past three months — as varied as they are — are all a part of the collective legacy of this disaster. There is no one right way to process them.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005417
Spousal Distancing: The Chinese Couples Divorcing Over COVID-19,"As China eases its virus-control policies, some couples are emerging stronger than ever. Others are sprinting straight to the divorce office.",2020-04-03,"Zhang Ning will soon be reunited with her husband. He left the couple’s hometown of Wuhan to visit relatives in late January, and just days later the central Chinese city suddenly went into lockdown, leaving him unable to return for over two months. But China is now easing travel restrictions as its COVID-19 epidemic subsides, allowing him to finally come home. Zhang couldn’t be less excited. “I’ve told him I’ve decided to divorce him,” the 34-year-old tells Sixth Tone. Rather than making their hearts grow fonder, the prolonged separation has exposed deep fissures in the couple’s relationship that they’d previously ignored, according to Zhang. She was left alone taking care of her elderly parents-in-law and 8-year-old son in a city at the heart of a global pandemic — and her husband was less than sympathetic. “When I called him wanting to release my emotions, at first he comforted me a bit, but then he became impatient,” says Zhang. One day, he snapped at her: “Aren’t you supposed to do all this?”  For Zhang, it was the final straw. For years, she’d stayed with her husband for the sake of their child, but from that moment on, she decided she was better off without him. “I’ve never felt that determined in my life,” says Zhang. “The pandemic helped me make up my mind.” Many Chinese couples have had similar realizations during the past few months. As cities began relaxing their virus-control policies in early March, registry offices across the country were swamped by an unprecedented number of divorce appointments. The northwestern city of Xi’an saw a surge in divorces, while a district in the southwestern city of Dazhou also reported a sharp increase in divorce applications between Feb. 24 and March 11. Lan Zi, a divorce counselor at a marriage registry office in the southern city of Shenzhen, says she’s been overwhelmed by the growing number of couples seeking her services since the start of the pandemic. “Couples are having to make reservations a month in advance before they can get a divorce,” Lan tells Sixth Tone. The recent spike follows years of rapid increases in China’s divorce rate, fueled by economic and societal changes that are empowering the nation’s women and undermining traditional taboos against dissolving marriages.  Nearly 4.5 million couples got divorced in 2018, a 2% year-over-year increase. Over a longer time frame, the increase is even more striking. China’s divorce rate in 2018 — 3.2 for every 1,000 people — is nearly six times higher than the rate for 1987. In the United States, by contrast, the divorce rate has been falling over the past decade and now stands at 2.9 per 1,000. The Chinese government has even felt the need to introduce policies designed to discourage couples from splitting. Getting a divorce in China is easy and cheap, with the formalities often taking less than an hour and costing as little as 9 yuan ($1.25), but legislators in December of last year proposed requiring couples to observe a 30-day “cool-off” period before officially ending their marriages. Local registry offices have also started offering free premarital and divorce counseling in recent years. Lan, the Shenzhen-based counselor, says she’s helped 115 couples reconcile with each other and cancel their divorce appointments during the past two months. The recent crisis, however, has been unlike anything Lan has seen before. For many couples, being locked up at home together for weeks created new tensions in their relationships and exacerbated old ones — and even counseling is not enough to resolve them. “Home isolation can cause many family conflicts to erupt,” Lan tells Sixth Tone. “A lot of ordinary little things may cause divides, or even become more intense — directly affecting the intimate relationship between husband and wife or leading to a marital crisis.”  Hong Lanzhen, a divorce lawyer based in the southern city of Dongguan, says she’s already handled multiple cases in which her clients have emerged from lockdowns determined to get divorced as quickly as possible. “One thing these couples have in common is that their relationships were fragile before the outbreak,” says Hong. “Quarantine forced them to stay together. The longer they were locked down, the more problems they had and the more disagreeable they were with each other.” Xiao Mei, a 32-year-old from Beijing, moved out of the apartment she used to share with her husband and filed for divorce soon after life in the city started to return to normal. She tells Sixth Tone the crisis revealed her husband’s “true face.” According to Xiao, her husband always used to tell her he was too busy with work to help with housework and child care. “But this time (during the lockdown) he had plenty of time, yet he still did nothing,” says Xiao. “I finally realized my husband is a giant baby, and I don’t want to carry on with this widow-like existence anymore.”  “The pandemic has been like the final straw to break marriages,” says Li Hua, a psychologist based in Zibo, East China’s Shandong province. “The small spears and shields that could be ignored or tolerated get suddenly exposed and pile up one on top of each other like a sharp knife, cutting mercilessly at the relationship.” The lockdowns came as a particular shock to the huge number of Chinese couples in long-distance relationships. The country has an estimated 288 million migrant workers as of 2018, with many living apart from their spouses and children for large chunks of the year as they work long hours in the big cities. Until the pandemic, Zheng Rujun only saw her husband once a month, as the pair had jobs in cities a three-hour drive apart in the southern Guangdong province. Their relationship was stable, and the couple treated each other with respect during their monthly visits, according to Zheng. Things quickly changed, however, once they found themselves living together for the first time since their wedding in 2017. “He throws dirty clothes and smelly socks all over the house; he plays video games on his phone all day long; and when I share with him my worries about the virus, he mocks me for making a fuss,” Zheng tells Sixth Tone. After a few weeks, Zheng couldn’t take it anymore and told her husband she wanted to break up. He was against the idea, telling her things would go back to normal once the lockdowns were over. But Zheng’s mind was made up. “Since I’ve already uncovered these problems I can’t bear, why waste time?” the 27-year-old says.  For others, it was the stress of being separated during the lockdowns that opened up new marital rifts, according to Li, the psychologist. “Women especially often feel anxious and insecure about their relationships,” says Li. “They worry about their husbands’ safety and whether they’re cheating.” According to Li, many of her female clients repeatedly asked their partners to send photos and videos of themselves to prove they were where they said they were. “I’ll help them … understand that their behavior will only push their husbands away,” she says. “When you feel inferior, you’ll be afraid of others abandoning you.” Financial pressures have been another source of strife, with firms cutting staff and the self-employed sometimes suffering drastic reductions in income as a result of the pandemic. The added stress has sometimes pushed marriages to their breaking point, according to Lan, the divorce counselor.  “The outbreak cuts off household incomes and the stress that comes with it triggers emotional crises,” says Lan. “We’ve seen this a lot during our daily work during the pandemic.” Not every relationship has been damaged by the crisis, however. Some couples have emerged from the lockdowns closer than ever. According to a survey by LoveMatters China, a platform for sex and intimacy education, nearly 300 of 1,500 respondents said they’d “stuck together” with their partners 24/7 during the lockdowns. Of those that had done so, 55% agreed that the daily super-close contact helped them communicate better and improved their relationships. Although disasters bring huge trauma and loss, researchers have found that they often also push survivors to move forward: People who are afraid and lonely marry earlier; those in the wrong relationships end them faster; and families considering having children stop hesitating. Chinese regions that experience earthquakes typically see their divorce and marriage rates rise by 6.1% and 1.9% respectively the following year, a study published in 2016 found. In the United States, the marriage, divorce, and fertility rates in South Carolina also increased following Hurricane Hugo in 1989, another study showed. “The disaster may simply act as an accelerator or catalyst for people’s actions,” explains Li. “They come to recognize the status of their marriages during the pandemic — this special life-or-death period — and make firmer decisions.”  Wang Liting, 35, says COVID-19 helped her understand what truly mattered to her. She’d been thinking about divorcing her husband of nearly 10 years before the pandemic struck. “I felt like he didn’t get me,” says Wang. “And I had a really bad relationship with my mother-in-law, who was always pushing me to have kids.” Wang had a change of heart, though, after the couple was confined to their home in Shenzhen. She started to feel unwell and panicked, fearing she’d been infected with the coronavirus. But then her husband stepped up, according to Wang. He took her to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with just a regular flu bug. He cooked for her, did all the housework, and watched comedy shows with her to help her relax. “I felt so loved in our marriage for the first time,” says Wang. “That’s when I knew he was the one I could rely on.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005435

In an interview Tuesday with Xinhua News Agency, a representative from the planning committee of the Beijing Winter Olympics, scheduled for February 2022, said the committee is evaluating the potential impact of the Tokyo Games’ postponement. “We will face the unique situation of holding the Summer and Winter Olympics and Paralympics all in the span of about six months,” the spokesperson said. “Based on the newly determined dates for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, we will evaluate the impact on preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics.” Some experts say the postponement should have a limited effect on the Beijing Winter Games. “We don't have so many winter sports stars like we do in the Summer Olympics,” He Wenyi, executive director of the China Institute for Sports Value at Peking University, told the Global Times, adding that stars are “the core of sports marketing.” He also said any Olympics-related promotional events would be “unlikely to be hugely affected.” However, Han Mengying, a senior analyst at consulting firm Analysys, told Sixth Tone that the reduced interval between the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics could affect the Winter Games’ market penetration and commercial value. “The original schedule gives an entire transition cycle of two years, which is preferable,” she said. “The shortened break makes the two countries’ arrangements quite tight, and brings competition for the same intellectual property.” From a macro perspective, as sports events become concentrated in the same year, the postponement may also affect other, smaller sports competitions as they struggle with their schedules and try to attract the attention of both viewers and sponsors, Han said. Another major sports event in China, the quadrennial National Games, are currently slated to be held in northwestern Shaanxi province in 2021 but are likely to be postponed, according to domestic media. The schedules of the 2021 Summer World University Games in Chengdu and the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou may also be affected. Meanwhile, Chinese businesses and entertainment groups — already reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic — are also under pressure because of the Tokyo Olympics’ postponement. E-commerce giant Alibaba, which reportedly paid 5 billion yuan ($705 million) to sponsor the Tokyo Games, has reportedly canceled its Olympics-related offline events since late January due to the pandemic. And a WeMedia account covering China’s entertainment industry noted that at least 16 preplanned sports-themed variety shows that were originally planning to premiere this year on television and video-streaming platforms could have their production plans delayed. According to the analyst, Han, brands with established marketing strategies as well as sports-related initiatives and content are having to rethink their plans. However, Han sees opportunities for brands and sports-related media to promote the mass consumption of a full spectrum of sports by Chinese audiences. “As the pandemic gives the public a better understanding of disease and personal health, it’s actually laying a good foundation for the subsequent dissemination and guidance of mass sports,” she said. “Sports-related media platforms can guide people to participate in more public sporting events, which can be a good direction that allows platforms to be more focused on their long-term marketing strategies.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005421
"Asymptomatic Cases Unlikely to Cause COVID-19 Rebound, Expert Says","Zhong Nanshan, China’s leading authority on respiratory diseases, says the country’s strong monitoring system will help isolate individuals without symptoms and contain the virus.",2020-04-02,"Renowned epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said Wednesday that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients will not cause another major outbreak in China, and that the country will not see a significant rebound if the transmission chain is cut off. “Because we have a strong monitoring system, once (asymptomatic carriers) are discovered, they will be immediately isolated. At the same time, relevant contacts will be immediately quarantined for observation,” Zhong said in an interview with Shenzhen TV. On Tuesday, the National Health Commission released data on asymptomatic coronavirus carriers for the first time and included them in the total case tally. As of Wednesday, there were 1,075 asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. According to the commission, such people — sometimes referred to as silent carriers — do not have the usual symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, and sore throat. Despite the absence of clinically recognizable symptoms or signs, tests for the coronavirus yield positive results for this group. Moreover, studies suggest they could be just as infectious as sick patients.  Concerns over silent carriers came to light in late January, when sporadic asymptomatic cases were detected from screenings of close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Though the National Health Commission first acknowledged the phenomenon on Jan. 28, asymptomatic patients were not required to be quarantined and could instead choose to self-isolate at home. According to the existing data collected and analyzed by Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper, there is no clear consensus on the rough proportion of asymptomatic individuals within an infected population. Comparisons among various studies, domestic and abroad, indicate that the proportion of asymptomatic infections can vary greatly depending on the sample. Iceland, which has the highest rate of coronavirus testing in the world, has a total population of 360,000. Nearly 18,000 people in the country have been tested for COVID-19, and around half of those who were positive were asymptomatic. In China, if silent carriers develop clinical symptoms, they become “confirmed cases” and are no longer classified as asymptomatic cases. In another interview with China Global Television Network on Sunday, Zhong said that he doesn’t think there is a large number of asymptomatic patients in China, as they would have infected many others, resulting in more known cases. “I don’t think at this stage we have a lot of asymptomatic patients,” he said. “If so, these patients would be transmitting (the virus) to other people, making the number higher. But now, actually, it’s going down.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005432
Hubei Honors 14 Martyrs of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Among them is Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who was punished by police for trying to warn his colleagues about the virus that ultimately killed him.",2020-04-02,"The Hubei government on Thursday honored 14 individuals — medical staff, police officers, and social workers — as martyrs after they lost their lives during China’s fight against COVID-19. Among them are two now-household names: doctor Li Wenliang and nurse Liu Fan, who both worked at hospitals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected. “The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious public health incident with the fastest spreading rate, the widest infection range, and the greatest difficulty to prevent and control,” the Hubei authorities’ announcement said. “Putting aside their own safety, these people worked on the front line, shouldered great responsibility, and gave everything.” Li died on Feb. 7 after exhaustive efforts to save him failed. Widely credited as one of the first people to raise the alarm about a mysterious SARS-like respiratory disease, the 34-year-old ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital was punished by local police in early January for “spreading rumors” about the virus. He later became infected while working at his hospital, one of the city’s designated medical facilities for receiving and treating suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Li’s death triggered an enormous public outcry. Within hours of the announcement, the central government dispatched a team to investigate Li’s death and the events leading up to it. The team’s report urged the Wuhan police to apologize for issuing a letter of criticism against Li for sharing information that proved to be largely true. Liu, a community health center nurse who had come out of retirement, developed symptoms on Feb. 6, running a fever. She died just over a week later. In addition, the coronavirus claimed the lives of her parents and younger brother. Also among the 14 martyrs is Liu Zhiming, the head of Wuchang Hospital and no relation to nurse Liu Fan, who died at the age of 51 after working around the clock to prepare his hospital wards and staff to receive some 500 confirmed cases. As Liu Zhiming’s condition rapidly deteriorated, his wife — a head nurse at another frontline hospital — wasn’t able to see him to say goodbye. The next day, a video of the disconsolate widow weeping while chasing after the hearse carrying her late husband tugged at the heartstrings of millions of viewers. Since the outbreak, the physical and psychological health of vulnerable and overworked medical staff has been a prominent problem. According to figures released in February, over 2,000 medical staff contracted the COVID-19 virus, and at least six lost their lives. In the early stages of the crisis, shortages of protective suits, goggles, and face masks meant greater risks of medical workers being exposed to the virus. In February, central authorities released a notice asking lower levels of government to honor some deceased medical workers as martyrs and offer assistance to their families in the form of financial and psychological support. Thanks to flexible policy interpretations, the families of many medical professionals who died during the crisis are being compensated for “work-related injuries” even if their deceased family member passed away at home rather than at the hospital.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005433
A Trans-Pacific Odyssey Through a COVID-19 World,"After a planned trip to China to see family and renew their visas was disrupted by the pandemic, a young couple must pick their way through a maze of travel restrictions.",2020-04-02,"This week, Sixth Tone will publish accounts from Chinese who were living, working, or traveling overseas when the pandemic hit, and their subsequent journeys in search of safe harbor. Part one can be found here, and part two here. The moment we boarded the plane back to China, things started spiraling out of control. My husband and I work in the United States. On Jan. 19, the day before we were due to make the trans-Pacific journey back to China for the Lunar New Year, health officials in the central city of Wuhan were still sending reassuring signals: There were only 136 cases of COVID-19 in that city, and our parents — far from the outbreak’s epicenter — hadn’t even heard about the disease. Nevertheless, my husband nervously joked about cancelling our trip. “Maybe we should just refund our tickets and not go back,” he said. All we could do was joke. We weren’t going to China just to see our families, but also to undergo interviews for our work visas. By the time we deplaned in Shanghai, 13 hours later, “novel coronavirus” was the top trending search term on Twitter-equivalent Weibo, face masks were selling out, and the country was on war footing. What ensued was a monthlong odyssey dodging lockdowns, quarantines, and ever-changing border control regimes. Our journey took us from Shanghai to my husband’s hometown in nearby Jiangsu province, to my parents’ home in the southwestern province of Sichuan, then Bangkok, Tokyo, and finally back to the San Francisco Bay Area — only to find that the pandemic had beaten us home. On the evening of Jan. 21, my husband and I ate out separately with friends in Shanghai. It would be the only time we’d do so during our three-week stay in China. The next morning, we donned face masks given to us by a friend and went to the U.S. Consulate for our visa interviews. Despite the rapidly escalating outbreak, few people in line were wearing masks. Our interviews went smoothly, and we were told right then and there that we’d been approved, though the paperwork would take some time. On Jan. 23, we saw online that our visas had been issued. That same day, Wuhan went into lockdown. But as we arrived in my husband’s hometown in the eastern city of Dongtai, we found a relaxed atmosphere, with few people in masks. Still, we canceled almost all of our planned visits to friends and relatives in the city. Things remained calm until Jan. 27, when we were scheduled to drive back to Shanghai and catch a flight to Sichuan. Just after we left, the part of Dongtai where we had been staying abruptly went into lockdown with no prior notice, and rumors floated that major cities around the country would follow Wuhan’s lead and shut down transit links. The rumors never panned out, and Shanghai remained accessible, but our usual four-hour drive took over nine, as passengers and drivers were subjected to temperature checks. We missed our flight and had to rebook for the next day. The flight still felt normal, however, with few of our fellow passengers in masks, and we soon met up with my parents in provincial capital Chengdu. Once there, we resumed our self-isolation. On Jan. 27, Shanghai had announced it was extending the Lunar New Year holiday, originally scheduled to end Jan. 30, to Feb. 9. We wouldn’t get our passports before Feb. 10. Instead of shopping and playing rounds of mahjong, we spent the next 16 days at home. Although the time passed easily with my parents looking after us, daily reports on the outbreak and the international situation strained our nerves. In the early hours of Feb. 1, my husband woke me up with more bad news from a California-based friend: The U.S. would start restricting entry to foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days, effective from Feb. 2. The visa chat group we were in buzzed with activity. Checking the status of our passports on the website of the U.S. visa center, it said they were still in the consulate. We’d missed our window. Faced with the prospect of unemployment, we searched for another way back. Looking at the rules, we found that, as long as we could stay in a third country for more than 14 days — and that country was not on the U.S. list of barred places — we would be allowed to reenter. That was easier said than done. As COVID-19 spread, more and more countries were closing their borders to travelers from China. We got our passports back on Feb. 12 — a friend shipped them to us from Shanghai — and decided to fly to Bangkok the very next day. At the time, the number of confirmed cases in Thailand was hovering around 30, but the number of suspected cases was climbing. Many locals were wearing face masks on the streets, but otherwise daily life seemed to carry on as usual. We tried to make the best of it, and even made a few trips to well-known Bangkok tourism attractions, masks firmly in place. But for the most part, we spent our two weeks in Thailand indoors trying to keep up with the news, only taking a break to buy or prepare food. Countries around the world were constantly changing their entry policies, and we were just two among many stranded travelers trying to navigate the fog. We joined a chat group for people trying to get back to the U.S. via third countries. Members posted their personal experiences daily, helping keep everyone up-to-speed with the latest developments. At the time, many recommended transferring via Japan or South Korea. Because the former had just experienced a surge in new cases related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we decided we would fly via South Korea instead. We bought our tickets on Feb. 22. The next day, South Korea’s total case count jumped to the second-highest in the world. We cancelled our tickets and decided to transfer in Tokyo after all. Finally, on Feb. 28, it was the day of our flight. As soon as we got off the plane in Tokyo, a member of the airport’s ground staff was waiting for us and picked us up. She asked us about the timeline of our departure from China and checked our documents. Next, she called U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Earnestly counting the number of days we’d been out of China on her fingers as she spoke on the phone, she received the go-ahead. We then had an interview with another airport employee, who again confirmed that we hadn’t returned to China during the past 14 days. She attached a small blue dot to our plane ticket and said with a smile: “All good!” Our flight landed in San Francisco around noon on Feb. 28. We had mentally prepared for what awaited us: a secondary check and even an interrogation about our travel histories, but it took just 10 minutes to get through customs, and we were asked only a few simple questions. In a daze, we made our way to the luggage carousel, collected our bags, and walked out into the arrival hall. All the way up to when I stepped out of the airport, I couldn’t believe our luck. By the time we entered the United States, there had already been outbreaks in South Korea and Italy. There were also cases of community infection in the U.S. We went to the supermarket the next day to stock up on food. Both my husband and I had already been told by our respective workplaces to work remotely for two weeks after returning; after just a day, mine began recommending all employees to stop going to the office. Now, the lockdown in Wuhan is coming to an end, while the U.S. is recording more than 10,000 cases a day. The six Bay Area counties have launched a shelter-in-place initiative, and nearly all residents are self-isolating. Many of our Bay Area acquaintances were alarmed when the rules were first put in place, even panicked — but we were just numb. Everything, from the lockdowns to the steady uptick in new cases around the nation, felt like a rerun, and we responded the same way we did in China: stocking up on food and staying home. Now, with the number of reported cases here more than double the comparable figure for China, it seems like everyone is just as numb and exhausted as we were. We’re happy that China was able to get its outbreak under control but also worried about the damage it has done and continues to do around the world. Every day the news seems to just get worse and worse. All we can do is try our best to protect ourselves, self-isolate, and wait for spring.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005406
"China’s ‘Daigou’ Got Rich Shopping Abroad. Now, They’re Going Broke.",The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a knockout blow to China’s massive gray market for luxury goods bought overseas.,2020-04-02,"For years, Zhu Nini’s day job was browsing the booths inside Seoul’s most famous clothing market. Armed with a selfie stick, the 32-year-old would livestream her trips to the Dongdaemun Shopping Complex for her 100,000 fans back in China, helping them buy any items they liked for a small fee. But Zhu’s life in South Korea came to a sudden end in January after she flew back to her hometown of Wuhan to celebrate the Lunar New Year with her family. Within days, the central Chinese city had been completely locked down as the coronavirus spread like wildfire — confining her and millions of others to their homes. Over two months later, Wuhan is finally starting to ease its lockdown, but people from the city are still banned from entering South Korea. For Zhu — and thousands of other Chinese professional shoppers, or daigou — the travel disruptions are a devastating blow.  “Because of the pandemic, many industries have run out of money, lost people and energy, and are struggling to carry on — daigou might be among them,” Zhu, who spoke under a pseudonym due to privacy concerns, tells Sixth Tone. The struggles of China’s daigou are sending shockwaves around the world. The daigou economy emerged as a way for Chinese consumers to get their hands on sought-after foreign products — from luxury handbags to high-end baby formula — that were hard to find or highly expensive in China. Daigou buy the goods overseas and then ship them back home to their clients, using a variety of tactics, both legal and illegal, to evade import duties. This gray market is now worth billions of dollars a year and by some estimates employs over 1 million Chinese. In 2014, four in 10 luxury purchases by Chinese consumers were made by daigou, according to consultancy Bain & Company. South Korea — famous for its cosmetics brands and K-pop fashion — is a particularly popular daigou hot spot. The trade, however, has slowed to a trickle as countries implement travel bans and compulsory quarantine periods, shutter shopping malls, cancel flights, and suspend international deliveries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  There are two main branches of the daigou business in China: “local daigou” like Zhu who reside permanently in foreign countries and mail products back to their Chinese clients; and “human-flesh daigou” that continuously fly back and forth between China and another nation, carrying items in their luggage. Both have been hit hard by the pandemic. Chen Yuanyuan is one of many human-flesh daigou forced to suspend their businesses. For years, she caught cheap red-eye flights to South Korea, loading up on lipstick, facial masks, and skin care sets in duty-free stores, and then sneaking her haul through Chinese customs to evade import duties. The low-cost approach helped her comfortably ride out previous external shocks to the daigou trade, such as the rise of cross-border e-commerce platforms in China and the 2019 e-commerce law, which tightened tax regulations for daigou. But Chen — who also spoke with Sixth Tone using a pseudonym to protect her privacy — has stayed in her hometown of Xiamen in eastern China since the COVID-19 outbreak began. Like many human-flesh daigou, her monthly Korean excursions are a lucrative side-hustle that tops up her salary as a regular office worker. Now, she’s not willing to risk continuing them.  Passengers traveling between China and South Korea currently have to undergo two weeks of quarantine on both legs of the trip. Those trying to avoid the forced isolation periods can face severe consequences. In March, Beijing rounded up 36 daigou suspected of flying to South Korea and sent them to designated sites for medical observation. Two people received 10 days’ detention for violating quarantine rules and “making trouble.” Local police have also passed airlines a blacklist of another 50 daigou, to prevent them leaving the country. “Every day, there are clients asking me when I’ll fly to South Korea, and I tell them, ‘not until the pandemic is over globally,’” Chen tells Sixth Tone. “I still have new clients and new orders, but if I can’t travel, I won’t have the products to complete the deals.”  Local daigou living abroad don’t have to worry about travel restrictions, but many are still facing huge challenges. Long, a Paris-based personal shopper who specializes in luxury brands, says the breakdown in global freight networks has made it difficult to get products home. In an extreme case, a package that was supposed to go directly between France and China was rerouted via India, South Korea, Singapore, and several Chinese cities before eventually making it to the customer, she says. “Usually, it takes one week to 10 days for my clients to receive their parcels, but now it might take three weeks,” says Long, who declined to give her full name for privacy reasons. Long began curtailing her shopping trips soon after COVID-19 reached Europe, even though she knew doing so would hurt her income. In the French capital, outlets for brands like Balenciaga, Chanel, and Gucci suddenly felt like dangerous places to be. “In late January, I heard that the first three confirmed cases in Paris were tourists who’d visited several shopping malls,” she recalls. By mid-March, Paris had shut down its malls completely as Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic. On the messaging app WeChat, Long changed her username to “Malls Closed,” to remind her clients not to bother trying to make an order. “If there are any daigou in Italy, France, or the United Kingdom saying that they’re waiting in line to check out, just delete them,” Long laughs. “That’s impossible now.”  For daigou — and the stores that rely on their business — the question is whether things can eventually return to normal. In Wuhan, Zhu has only recently begun worrying about when she can return to South Korea. A few weeks ago, her mother developed a cough and tested positive for COVID-19. She was later transferred to a hospital for treatment, and Zhu and her father had to move to a designated quarantine hotel for two weeks. During the quarantine, Zhu tried to host a livestream to catch up with her fans. But only a few thousand viewers took part — a major blow to Zhu, as she’d normally attract over 50,000 for a broadcast from Seoul.  “I have two major concerns: One is that I have no income, and the other is that I’ll lose my clients,” says Zhu. “It’s a real problem, as the competition is fierce.” Businesses in South Korea are also at risk. The Seoul outlet of The Shilla Duty Free alone is estimated to have lost over $100 million in sales since the start of the pandemic. According to Zhu, the owners of several clothing booths in Dongdaemun have contacted her, asking whether they can find alternative ways to continue trading. “Many people like me have come back to China, so their sales have dropped, too,” says Zhu.  For now, Zhu is asking the Dongdaemun traders to send samples to her in China, so she can host livestreams from home. Luckily, delivery services finally resumed normal operations in Wuhan in late March. But the Wuhan native knows she’ll struggle to attract buyers using this imperfect workaround. Broadcasts from the market were faster-paced and allowed her to show off a greater range of samples. Enthusiasm among her fans is already waning.  And the decline might be difficult to reverse. The daigou business has become brutally competitive in China and livestream hosts need an edge to stay relevant. In 2017, Zhu could make a profit of 60 yuan ($8.50) on each T-shirt she sold, but now she’s lucky to earn 10 yuan. Top livestreamers, meanwhile, are increasingly hiring assistants and professional models for their shows. “Daigou who have a large number of followers and sell 10,000 pieces a night can still make a lot of money, but it’s hard for new players to survive,” says Zhu. Zhu’s hoping she can keep afloat by focusing on maintaining a small group of loyal, long-term clients. Instead of going for the hard sell, she plans to chat with the viewers like they’re old friends. Even this change in strategy, however, might not be enough. “Maybe the pandemic will force an industry reshuffle on all of us,” says Zhu. “There’s a chance I might not be able to get past it.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005426
"A Family, a Flight, a Fight to Get Home","With the pandemic taking root in the United States, a young family decides to return to China.",2020-04-01,"This week, Sixth Tone will publish accounts from Chinese who were living, working, or traveling overseas when the pandemic hit, and their subsequent journeys in search of safe harbor. Part one can be found here. Part three will be published Thursday. On March 18, my mother, husband, 7-month-old son Wilmar, and I arrived at Los Angeles International Airport, ready to return home to Shanghai. Back in late January, we watched with alarm from the United States as COVID-19 spread across China. After three major U.S. carriers canceled their flights between the two countries, on Jan. 31 the American government announced it would bar entry to most foreign nationals with recent China travel histories and start instituting limited quarantines. Although we’re both based in Shanghai, my American husband works for a company with offices in that city and in California, and we decided to extend our stateside stay by a month. By late February, however, the situation in China was showing signs of stabilizing, just as the pandemic had begun to take root in the U.S. We knew there were risks involved, but after the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. was all but certain, we decided it was time to go back. On March 13, U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency; on the day of our flight, New York state recorded more than 1,000 new cases. As a journalist, I’ve reported on environmental issues from Congo during the Ebola crisis in 2016 and toured black markets in Laos. Since becoming a mother, however, that fearlessness has seemingly vanished. The week before our flight, I kept waking up in the middle of the night to look at my baby sleeping beside me. I wondered how we could possibly keep him safe. Most of the other passengers on our flight were international students, eager to get home. A handful of them were dressed in protective gowns, safety goggles, and masks. Once on board, they barely moved except to lower their masks to take a sip of water. We arrived at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport some 20 hours later, on March 19, local time. Two days earlier, the city had begun treating the U.S. as a “key” country. Whereas travelers from low-risk countries could go home and self-quarantine after a medical check, those arriving from moderate- or high-risk countries had to undergo more tests to see if they would be sent to a hospital or be quarantined. A week later, with the pandemic spreading everywhere, those quarantines would become mandatory for all international arrivals to the city. Coming from a high-risk country, we knew that, starting from the moment we entered the country, we would be kept physically isolated from the outside world until the authorities could be sure we weren’t infected. As soon as we landed, health officials in hazmat suits came on board. “Elderly passengers or those with children can disembark first,” one of them said. That was music to my ears, as my son had been fussing and bouncing on my leg. After disembarking, we were asked to fill out health declaration forms. An official asked us about the places we had visited in the last 14 days, down to the states and cities, while another took our temperatures. After leaving customs, passengers were separated according to our residential neighborhood and directed onto a dedicated bus, which shuttled us to a local COVID-19 testing point. Five hours after landing in Shanghai, we reached our testing site, which was located at the southeastern tip of the city. The staff were dressed in white hazmat suits that made it impossible to see their faces, but they had written their names — or in some cases, humorous nicknames — on their gear. Wilmar peered out curiously from my arms at what felt like a scene straight out of the “Resident Evil” franchise. I was glad he didn’t cry.  The testing site was situated in the spacious courtyard of a hotel, separated from the neighboring buildings with fences and iron gates. The test was a simple oral swab, but it was a challenge to get Wilmar to cooperate. He didn’t understand what was happening, and the doctor had to keep opening her mouth wide until Wilmar learned to mimic her. We were told that the sample results would take at least 12 hours. Drained by our long flight and the quarantine, we were happy to be able to rest at the hotel. On our second night, however, the hotel phone suddenly rang. “Your car’s waiting outside,” the caller said. “Hurry up and come down.” Our oral swab had come back negative. It felt like a huge burden had been lifted off our shoulders. My husband and I had tried to make plans in case one of us fell sick, but the discussion always petered out as soon as our son came up. Fifty hours had passed since we had boarded our flight at LAX, but we could finally return home. This was without a doubt the longest, most stressful homeward journey I have ever experienced.  The neighborhood committee, police, and doctors from the community hospital were waiting by the gates of our neighborhood. The doctor took our temperature yet again, while the police and the neighborhood committee took down our personal information. They told us we would need to quarantine ourselves at home. We would not be allowed to go outside for 14 days. In addition to reporting our temperatures to the community hospital every day, they would also conduct spot checks. Property management would take care of our shopping and trash. The next day, the neighborhood committee installed a black box outside our door. It was a sensor. If we opened our door, it would send a notification to their phones. Although my husband called these measures “extreme” and “crazy,” he wasn’t complaining. Instead, he has repeatedly told his friends elsewhere that they’re exactly why he trusts China’s ability to contain the virus. We’re both grateful for the people who’ve worked so tirelessly to make it all possible: We finally don’t have to worry about Wilmar’s health. Instead we worry about our friends and family in the U.S. and Europe, where the situation has deteriorated. It wasn’t that long ago that we were mailing masks from the U.S. to our friends in China. Now my husband is mailing them the other way. When we first arrived in Shanghai, he called his younger brother and sister-in-law, who live in New York City. His sister-in-law works at a hospital there and was about to be assigned to the ICU. The staff at her hospital had been told they would have to reuse their masks and other protective gear. Their child just turned 1. I can’t even begin to imagine the stress they’re under. All I can do is hope things get better soon.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005407
How a Rugged COVID-19 Recovery Risks Over 100 Million Jobs,"The pandemic has left much of China’s private sector on life support. Now that the threat of infection is finally receding, can the country jump start a recovery in time?",2020-04-01,"Sun Xiao can tell you off the top of her head how many days have passed since Jan. 23. That’s the date the Beijing tour guide became “de facto unemployed,” and she has counted each of the 65 days since. Following the lockdown Jan. 23 of central China’s Wuhan metropolis to slow the spread of COVID-19, China hit the pause button for the travel industry, suspending all domestic tour services and related flight and hotel sales and halting international tours four days later. Sun is one of almost 30 million people affected at more than 40,000 travel companies across China. Now, as the outbreak slows in China, Sun and her colleagues in the industry wait anxiously for business to resume. Since early March, some scenic sites outside central Hubei province, where the coronavirus first emerged in China, have reopened for tourists, but travel agencies have largely remained closed as the pandemic now accelerates abroad. The plight of Sun and others in the travel industry shows how hard it will be for the world’s second-largest economy to get back to work. The coronavirus outbreak put almost all business activities on hold since the Lunar New Year holiday in late January. Those stuck out of work also include millions of people in catering, accommodations, housekeeping services, manufacturing, and construction. The pandemic delivered a heavy blow to a Chinese economy that was already struggling to manage downward pressures and a weakening job market. Economists widely project that the economy is contracting in the first quarter, dragging projected 2020 GDP growth down to 4% or even lower. Based on 2018 and 2019 data, every 1 percentage point of GDP growth affects more than 2 million jobs.  China’s official unemployment rate jumped to a record 6.2% in February from 5.3% in January. During the first two months of 2020, 1.08 million new jobs were added in China’s urban areas, down 660,000 from the same period last year. The February surge in unemployment reflects massive business suspensions and workforce cuts, according to Zhang Yi, a senior official at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Industries including retail, catering, accommodations, transportation, logistics, and entertainment have experienced the biggest job losses, Zhang said. At two Cabinet meetings in March, Premier Li Keqiang repeatedly called for efforts to stabilize the job market. “As long as employment is stable this year, it will not be a big deal if the economic growth rate is higher or lower,” Li said. “It is likely a signal,” said Zhang Yu, chief macroeconomy analyst at Huachuang Securities. Compared with efforts to keep economic growth at a certain level amid external uncertainties, maintaining a stable job market is a more pragmatic way to benefit the economy in the long run, Zhang said. The pandemic brings thornier challenges and more lasting impacts to China’s labor market than the 2008 financial crisis, when factories laid off workers as business declined. Although early domestic measures to contain the disease hit the job market by halting production and restricting people’s mobility, the ensuing outbreak in the rest of the world is eroding external demand and weighing on the workshop of the world’s efforts to recover. The global supply chain is at risk.  Li Zhong, China’s vice minister of human resources and social security, said March 19 that while some companies are still struggling to hire enough workers, an increasing number of others are facing the threat of losing orders, forcing production lines to stay idle. Meanwhile, the services sector that has created the most new jobs in recent years is struggling to resume business amid lingering contagion risks and consumers’ increasing hesitation to spend. Compounding the challenge is that the structure of China’s job market has changed profoundly since the 2008 financial crisis. The number of migrant workers — who are mainly employed in construction and manufacturing — has declined sharply over the past 10 years as the older generation retired. In 2019, 2.4 million new migrant workers entered the job market, down from 10 million each year a decade ago.  In their place, new college graduates have become the major category of new entrants in the job market. In 2020, about 8.7 million students will graduate from colleges. Most of them will need a job and prefer occupations in industries other than construction or manufacturing. Consequently, policymakers can’t just flip a switch to spur hiring in labor-intensive sectors such as property and infrastructure as they could a dozen years ago. Leaders have turned to more sophisticated policy measures to address the evolution of the job market. On March 20, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, issued a set of guidelines to promote business resumption and job market recovery, outlining policies to support the return of migrant workers and create more occupations for them, increase state companies’ recruitment of new graduates, expand enrollment of postgraduate students, and draft more graduates for military service. More supportive packages will also be offered to help people who lost jobs and ensure their basic incomes. Those guidelines followed a series of measures by central and local governments since late January to help businesses stay afloat. The steps include policies to reduce employers’ social welfare contributions and lower business costs. The policies would save businesses more than 500 billion yuan ($70.5 billion) this year, officials said. In response to the job market challenges, the central government will step up policies to support companies, especially small- and mid-sized enterprises, to maintain stable business operations and employment, said Mao Shengyong, an NBS spokesman. Mao said he expects unemployment to decline in the second half as the economy revives.  Business on Pause The COVID-19 outbreak forced businesses across China to extend the normal weeklong Lunar New Year holiday through February as people stayed home to avoid contagion. In normal years, companies resume operations about a week after the holiday. Official data showed that just 60% of migrant workers who returned home for the holiday were back to work as of March 7. The rate rose to 80% by March 19. Many companies in labor-intensive industries had trouble filling factory floors until earlier this month as workers in virus-hit regions such as Hubei and Henan provinces were barred from traveling. Meanwhile, many employers that managed to round up enough workers have since cut hours because of slowing demand and concerns about lingering risks of infection. Overall working hours in February totaled 40.2 hours a week — 6.5 hours less than in the previous month, NBS data showed. In the first two months this year, China’s total electricity consumption declined 8.2% year-over-year while industrial contribution to domestic gross product fell 13.5%. The catering industry reported a 43% revenue drop in the first two months from a year ago. Accommodations and housekeeping industry revenue nosedived by more than 75% in February alone, official data showed.  The freezing-up of business quickly translated to the labor market. A survey by Ernst & Young in late February found that 25.5% of companies said they furloughed or laid off workers or cut wages. Companies also reduced recruitment during the outbreak, although February is traditionally the high season for job-hunting. A joint survey by Peking University and recruitment site Zhaopin.com found that new job listings in the first two months this year dropped 32.4% from a year ago. Entertainment, services, telecom, and internet were among the industries affected the most. As the outbreak wanes and travel restrictions ease nationwide, businesses since early March have accelerated the pace of resuming operations. Data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) showed that as of March 13, 95% of China’s industrial enterprises — excluding those in Hubei — resumed operation with an average 80% of their workers. But figures for the services sector were held down. As of March 26, the resumption rate for catering companies was 80%, for accommodations 60%, and for housekeeping businesses 40%, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Close personal contact, weakening consumer confidence, and reliance on a massive labor force are factors hindering the service sector’s recovery after the long pause, said Zhu Xiaoliang, a senior official at the ministry.  Travel’s Grim Outlook The grim outlook of the travel industry threatens the living of 100 million people. In 2019, the travel industry hired more than 28 million people, with nearly 80 million others working in related businesses. That involved almost 10% of China’s total employment. The industry contributed 10.9 trillion yuan to China’s GDP last year, or 11% of the total. As parks closed and flights were grounded, China’s travel industry is expected to lose 1.18 trillion yuan in revenue this year, a 20.6% drop from last year, according to Beijing-based China Tourism Academy. Although experts said tourism companies should keep their workforces ready for a resumption of business, many enterprises face pressures to stay afloat. Companies have been closed for too long and lost too much revenue, said a person from a large state-owned travel agency in the southwestern Yunnan province. The company has stopped paying employees and has let people go, he said.  “We have no choice but to lay people off in order to survive,” said another travel service provider in Beijing. The fallout of the travel industry freeze also affects hotel operators. American luxury hotel chain Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson said March 18 that the company’s business plunged 90% in China and the slump continued elsewhere around the world as the virus spread. According to Sorenson, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a larger financial impact on Marriott than 9/11 and the financial crisis combined. Restaurants also suffered and consider recovery far-off. Song Hongyang, a restaurant owner in southern city Shenzhen, made the hard decision to close his business and let go of more than 30 employees March 1. His restaurant, in an industrial area, has had almost no business since February but more than 400,000 yuan of monthly costs for rent, utilities, and salaries, he said. “Every day I kept it running, I lost money,” Song said. A survey by the China Hotel Association (CHA) in late February found that nearly half of the 309 catering companies surveyed had plans to close part of their outlets. Meanwhile, 56% of the companies said they would lay off some employees. A catering industry source in the southern Guangdong province said that although earlier supportive policies cut some costs for restaurant operators, the industry needs more incentives to bolster incomes. The CHA forecast that if the pandemic could be successfully controlled by the end of March, the losses to China’s catering industry would be around 1.3 trillion yuan this year. But the industry will revive as business resumes in the second quarter and starts a stronger rebound in following quarters.  Lingering Risks While most workers in the services sectors are still waiting to return to their jobs, those in factories face new troubles. “At first it was clients in Europe, Japan, and South Korea that cancelled their orders; now American clients also started cancellations,” said an executive of a Jiangsu textile company. The factory has experienced a 70% decline in orders from the same time last year, the executive said. As COVID-19 continues to rage across the globe, more countries have turned to drastic measures to suspend businesses and lock down cities. Overseas clients have been cancelling orders since early March, and the pace is increasing rapidly, said Huang Wei, vice president of the Shanghai branch of garment exporter Li & Fung Ltd.  A jewelry company manager in Yiwu, eastern Zhejiang province, said about 5% of the company’s orders have been dropped over the past two weeks. March is usually the busy season, but this year there are almost no new orders, said the manager, who said he expects a 30% to 40% drop in orders this year. As business cools, manufacturers are considering reductions in pay or workforce to save money. A survey by Zhaopin.com found that about one-third of companies said they have layoff plans. A dramatic decline in foreign demand amid the pandemic will pose great challenges to China’s export industry, threatening the jobs of nearly 60 million people, said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd. in Hong Kong. The COVID-19 outbreak is squeezing China’s job market from both the supply and the demand end, said Lu, who suggested greater policy support to stabilize the market. Policies should focus on easing the strains of small businesses to encourage resumption as well as measures to prevent company and household default, Lu said. Policymakers could consider using targeted quantitative easing to increase the money supply or special government bonds to support companies and households hit hard by the pandemic to counter the economic fallout and support a recovery of consumption, Lu said.

China Delays College Entrance Exam Due to COVID-19,Tuesday’s announcement marks the first time in over 40 years that the “gaokao” has been postponed nationwide.,2020-03-31,"China’s notoriously difficult college entrance exam, the gaokao, is being postponed for one month because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Education announced Tuesday. According to the announcement, this year’s administration of the gaokao — a nine-hour standardized test that evaluates students in Chinese, math, English, and either the sciences or liberal arts — will be held on July 7-8. Given the unique COVID-19 situations in different provinces, local governments in Hubei and Beijing are allowed to propose additional adjustments to their gaokao schedules, the ministry said. This is the first time the make-or-break test will be postponed nationwide since it was resumed in 1977 following the Cultural Revolution. In 2008, after the Wenchuan earthquake left more than 80,000 people dead or missing in China’s heartland, some 120,000 students from Sichuan and Gansu provinces had to take the test not in June, but a month later. Since the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, whether the gaokao will be postponed has been a hot topic for the country’s roughly 10 million high school seniors. During a press conference on Feb. 28, Weng Tiehui, China’s deputy education minister, said that a decision would be made after a comprehensive evaluation of the outbreak’s impact, the safety of students and teachers, and the precautionary measures that can be taken in examination rooms. The ministry said it arrived at its decision by following the principle of “being fair first.” Since the gates of most schools in China were closed because of the pandemic and students of all ages were shunted to online classes, those living in rural areas or disadvantaged homes have had an especially hard time coping with the new arrangement. “Given the different online study conditions across urban and rural areas, the impact on some students preparing for the exam in villages and poor areas has been much greater,” the ministry said in a detailed explanation Tuesday afternoon. Earlier this month, a ninth grader tried to kill herself after falling behind in her online classes because she did not have regular access to a computer or smartphone. This year’s high school seniors are sometimes described as the most “tragic” class since the gaokao was resumed. “Born in the year of the SARS outbreak and taking the gaokao in the year of COVID-19,” reads one popular online comment. As students in other grades continue to study from home, high school seniors in some provinces have already come back to campus to prepare for the gaokao. Tang Yi, the director of education at Zhenjiang No. 1 High School in the eastern Jiangsu province, told Sixth Tone that around 900 seniors at the school resumed classes on Monday, in accordance with the local government’s schedule. “We set different times for students to arrive on campus, and every student and teacher is required to wear a mask and ensure the greatest possible distance between desks during class,” Tang said, adding that staff disinfect the classrooms at the end of each school day. Following the announcement of the gaokao’s postponement, Tang convened a conference with his fellow teachers. Together, they drew up detailed plans for their students and discussed how teachers from other grades could motivate or otherwise help seniors during the extra month. “For the top students, they will be better prepared for top universities,” Tang said. “For the other students, they will have a higher chance of achieving an academic breakthrough and a shot at their dream schools.” However, the delayed gaokao may only add to the pressure felt by overstressed students. “For some students who are already burned out because of the gaokao, this is not good news,” a Shanghai student surnamed Lei told Sixth Tone. Yet he believes that having an extra month to study will make up for any edge lost during the past two months of distance learning. “For undisciplined students like me, the online classes aren’t as effective as real ones,” Lei said. Some teachers and parents, meanwhile, have expressed concerns about the gaokao being rescheduled during the hottest time of the year. “The gaokao was moved to June (in 2003) because the weather got to be too hot in July,” a veteran high school teacher surnamed Hong told Sixth Tone. “If it’s later in the summer, this may cause controversy between parents and students about whether they should study and take the exams in air-conditioned rooms. They might worry about the students catching cold, or not being able to focus because of the noise from the air conditioners.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005414
"Amid a Pandemic, a Sudden Farewell to Cambridge","As the world closes its borders, a Chinese international student ponders her next step.",2020-03-31,"This week, Sixth Tone will publish accounts from Chinese who were living, working, or traveling overseas when the pandemic hit, and their subsequent journeys in search of safe harbor. Part two will be published Wednesday. In just a few days’ time, the situation in the U.K. took a turn for the worse. As with every other academic vacation, I had been planning to fly to Canada to see my boyfriend after the winter term. I booked my March 28 flight all the way back in January, before COVID-19 even had a name, but as February turned to March, the dramatic escalation of the crisis in Europe forced me to rethink my plans. Roughly three weeks before I was set to depart, I emailed my academic supervisor for advice. He didn’t dissemble: “I think that you should rebook your ticket to leave as soon as possible,” he said. By the time I bought a new one, for March 17, the cost of an economy seat from London to Toronto had skyrocketed to approximately 1,000 pounds ($1,200) — more than four times the usual price. Ever since the fallout from the U.K. government’s ill-starred “herd immunity” plan, people’s nerves seemed to be on edge. Some of my friends started looking at tickets back to China, while others decided to stock up on food and ride the pandemic out in Cambridge. Almost no one wanted to upend their lives, and even those who chose to leave did so in the hope they’d be back in a few months’ time. I shared those hopes. But the reality of the situation suggests that we underestimated the pandemic. Within two days of booking my flight, the University of Cambridge began requiring domestic undergraduate students to clear out their dormitories and return home. International students like me, both undergraduate and graduate students alike, were encouraged to do the same. The wording grew stronger with each missive, as life began to feel like that episode of “Downtown Abbey” in which the estate was recommissioned as a sanatorium for soldiers. Things were also moving fast across the pond in Canada. On March 15, I got a text from my boyfriend saying that one of his roommates had told their landlord I was coming. Now the woman was demanding I quarantine myself for two weeks before I could stay there. I was furious — not about the quarantine but that my boyfriend’s roommate had reported us to their landlord rather than talk it over with us. Another of their housemates’ girlfriends had just flown in from Germany two weeks ago, and no one had said anything. Canada’s rules were less stringent at the time. People still weren’t paying close attention to the pandemic, nor did they realize how bad things had gotten in Europe. It was an abrupt lesson in what the famous scholar of Chinese literature Qian Liqun once referred to as the “sophisticated egoism” of certain social elites. It’s easy to ignore problems as long as they don’t affect us — but once that calculation changes, we become alert to anything, no matter how small, that could pose a threat. All I could do was stay calm and look for the silver lining: Perhaps my boyfriend and I would be more comfortable renting a place and living there by ourselves. But if nerves were running high, the world still seemed peaceful as I walked down the streets of Cambridge. On March 16, a day before my flight, I got a notice from Facebook reminding me that, on that same day two years ago, I had shared a photo of myself sitting outside. The weather was just as inviting then as now, with the cherry blossoms and daffodils in bloom, and I felt a deep reluctance to leave, like it might be a long time before I made it back. I decided to revisit all of my favorite places in the city: the piano room on campus, as well as my favorite café and bakery. Returning to my room, I had just started to cut into my cake when I saw the news: Canada was closing its borders, except to U.S. citizens and diplomatic passport holders. My heart started pounding. I threw myself in front of my computer to check the date of the border closure, and then checked it again: March 18 at noon. Theoretically, I would still be able to enter the country. My heart rate slowly returned to normal as I counted my blessings. My boyfriend and I video chatted, trying to boost each other’s spirits. As long as there were no more unexpected surprises, I would be with him soon.  On the morning of March 17, I set off for Gatwick Airport. Everything went smoothly. The sun was out, and there were only a few passengers there waiting for their flights. An airport employee kindly told me that Canada’s travel restrictions would go into effect the next day, adding: “You will be absolutely fine.” It took only five minutes for me to drop off my luggage and get through security. After boarding, I wiped down all possible contact areas with disinfectant; the older passenger sitting in front of me was even more meticulous. But the friendly staff member was wrong — I wouldn’t be absolutely fine. At customs in Toronto, I was grilled by the agent on duty: “Why did you come here? Why do you need to visit your boyfriend at this time?” she asked. I was confused. I had a long-term visa that allowed me to stay for six months. I had been careful throughout my entire journey, avoided all unnecessary contact, and changed my mask every four hours. The agent wasn’t even wearing one. I assured her that my insurance and savings met Canada’s entry requirements.  Finally, the agent pronounced her verdict: “You can stay in Canada for 14 days. After that, you’ll have to leave.” That made no sense, I told her. All it would do was create another nonessential trip in two weeks’ time. Her colleague asked if everything was OK, and the agent wrongly explained that I had only come to Canada to quarantine myself with my boyfriend. “Let her go back to her own country,” I heard her colleague reply. I walked out of customs in a daze. Right now, I’m quarantined in a rented house in Toronto. The weather here is as beautiful as the day I left the U.K. I contacted a friend of mine who is a lawyer and wrote a complaint to customs. I also applied to extend my visa on March 23, and I can stay while my request is being processed. Even though I still don’t know whether I will have to leave, I feel strangely calm. Perhaps it’s because my boyfriend is here. My parents occasionally send me messages on social media app WeChat about yet another direct flight to China they’ve found. They ask if I want to book a ticket back. My friends in Cambridge send messages of comfort and tell me that the U.K. has stepped up its coronavirus prevention measures. I’ll always have a place to stay if I return, they say. My friends in China send messages pleading with me to minimize my travels and figure out how to bunker down in Canada while keeping a return route to China open as a backup plan. Just a few weeks ago, I was stressing over my first-ever academic talk and worrying about all the papers on medieval semantics that I had yet to master. I miss Cambridge, the ability to knock on my supervisor’s office door and be greeted with the usual question: “Tea or coffee?”  Instead, I have witnessed the rise of unreasonable, nigh-xenophobic fear and criticism; the replacement of personal freedom with suspicion and antagonism; the weakness of relationships that had seemed strong; and the flawed reality of human nature. I don’t know when I will be able to return or what “returning” would even look like at this point. Before leaving campus, I met with my supervisor one last time. “Things will settle down soon,” he said, optimistically. “I hope we’ll be able to start again as normal next term and you can present your research in June.” “I hope so,” I replied. “Do take care of yourself.” “You too,” he said. “God bless you.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005384
Why It’s Time to Re-Roll the US-China Relationship,The COVID-19 pandemic reveals the folly of papering over the cracks instead of finding a long-term fix.,2020-03-30,"In recent weeks, Chinese social media has made much light of people in the U.S. and a number of other Western countries frantically buying and hoarding toilet paper. It isn’t the only thing people around the world have been panic-buying, but it has gotten the most press, partly because it makes for an amusing and absurd story. As many have pointed out, rice might be the most comparably sought-after product in China, but rice is a staple food. Why have so many Westerners apparently fixated on toilet paper? In truth, people have been panic-buying and hoarding more than these tissues, which weren’t even the first items to sell out in many places. Masks, hand sanitizer, and disposable gloves typically went first, followed by fresh meat, eggs, milk, and then frozen and canned goods. And yes, somewhere in the midst of all this, people bought a lot of toilet paper. There are likely a number contributing factors here. The first is cost. Toilet paper is cheap, it’s not going to spoil, and eventually, you’ll need it even if there isn't a shortage. It gives people an affordable sense of security when everything else, from their paychecks to their very health, seems so uncertain. Second, generally speaking, there is the underlying political philosophy in some Western countries — and the U.S. in particular — that the government can’t be trusted and self-reliance is vital. While people in China might have mixed feelings about their government, and especially local officials, reliance on government generally seems higher, and citizens have high expectations of it. This belief system stands in contrast to systems that privilege private property protections, divide government to limit its power, and count on civil society to pick up the slack. The economist Milton Friedman and his disciples waged a yearslong battle to convince politicians, economists, and the public that government is not the solution, it’s the problem. This tradition is particularly dear to the modern conservative movement, which dominates in the U.S., but can also be found to varying degrees in the U.K., France, and Germany. Judging by recent social media posts, some Chinese who still see Western civilization through rose-tinted glasses have attributed its apparent toilet paper fixation to the concerns of a “more civilized society.” That’s a bit silly, not to mention culturally insensitive toward societies that aren’t panic-buying toilet paper. A better theory is that the product is associated with better health and cleanliness, which many consider crucial during a pandemic. Of course, it’s hard to find anyone still wearing rose-tinted glasses these days. If Sino-U.S. relations were already in decline, the pandemic has only made things worse. But despite initial impressions that China had severely bungled things, there is a growing belief that its handling of the outbreak has been far superior to Western countries — offering it the opportunity to flip the script, so to speak. Originally — and to a significant extent, this is still the case — some Americans reacted to the initial outbreak in culturally insensitive and even openly racist ways. This impulse has been fueled in part by leaders and media figures who have variously blamed Chinese culture for creating the virus and the Chinese government for failing to stop its spread. Doing so allowed them to both distract people from failures closer to home, and to continue to undermine Sino-American relations, advancing the “decoupling” of the two countries. A Morning Consult poll conducted in mid-March found that 73% of U.S. adults believed China was “very” or “somewhat” responsible for the spread of COVID-19 — more than any other polled cause. The shift toward decoupling seems above all else to be a misguided response to two powerful but contradictory trends at work in the modern world. First, there is a competition of systems underway, on whether the Chinese or the American method is best. This competition stretches across domestic and international issues, politics, and economics. And regardless of whether either country is actually seeking to sustain or establish its hegemony, the perception has led to increased tensions and growing conflict. At the same time, however, the two countries are also converging, and have more in common now than ever before — sometimes in ways that are discomforting to those standing on either side. A few months ago, many considered the pandemic to be simply a Chinese problem. Even as China moved aggressively to contain and suppress the outbreak, some observers remained unconcerned that it might reach their countries. Even those who did sometimes held such a low opinion of Chinese abilities that they did not believe responding to it would require much work. Of course, when the virus did reach their shores, many of these same individuals were caught flat-footed. With a few notable exceptions, they have proven unable to respond internally or form an effective global response. Some in the West are starting to wonder whether the Chinese system has worked better, and if so, why. There is also an increasing lack of faith in America’s ability to lead the global response effort, with many prominent Western publications fretting over this development. This has been underscored by Trump’s “America First” approach, most gallingly on display in his refusal to relax sanctions on Iran, tariffs on China, and the incredible, though disputed, story of his attempt to buy a German pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine for COVID-19 — with the caveats that the U.S. would own the vaccine, control access, and provide it to Americans first. By contrast, the Chinese response has included calls for more effective global partnerships. And now that its outbreak is seemingly under control, its companies are shipping medical supplies to hot spots around the world. The U.S. itself is drawing on this supply chain; just this week it organized a medical supply airlift to source needed items from China. Yet few have drawn the obvious lessons — that there is much to be gained learning from and working with China, not only in suppressing this disease but also in other spheres. To pick one example among many: It is necessary for the two countries to coordinate their responses to global warming, which threatens everyone — and which, incidentally, contributes to the risk not only of environmental collapse, but may also spur more novel outbreaks like COVID-19, as environmental changes prompt new disease patterns among viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. The ongoing pandemic demonstrates our shared vulnerabilities, our interconnectedness, and the necessity of mutual understanding and working together, whatever our differences. Fundamentally, fighting with each other — or even merely decoupling — will only lead to more tragedy. And no amount of toilet paper or emergency medical supply airlifts will protect us from the mess that follows.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005385
"COVID-19 Patients Without Symptoms Just as Infectious, Study Suggests","Chinese disease control researchers analyzed infections among 2,147 close contacts of 191 patients and found no statistically significant difference in transmission rates between symptomatic and asymptomatic coronavirus carriers.",2020-03-30,"The close contacts of COVID-19 carriers without symptoms are just as likely to become infected as those of confirmed patients, according to a study published Saturday in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology. Researchers at the Ningbo Center for Disease Control and Prevention in eastern China’s Zhejiang province tracked 191 COVID-19 patients and 2,147 of their close contacts identified from Jan. 21 to Mar. 6. They found that 6.3% of people who came into close contact with symptomatic COVID-19 patients were later diagnosed with the disease, compared with 4.1% of people in close contact with asymptomatic cases. The team conducted an analysis of the two infection rates and found no statistically significant difference, suggesting the discrepancy could be due to chance. “Asymptomatic cases can be infectious, and thus we must try our best to discover and manage them,” Chen Yi, a co-author of the study, told Sixth Tone. According to China’s national guidelines for diagnosing and treating COVID-19, asymptomatic cases are patients who test positive for the virus but do not show clinical symptoms like fever or cough. A week ago, Sixth Tone reported on the risks these “silent carriers” — who aren’t counted as “confirmed cases” in China — could pose to healthy people. The same day, the city’s health authority reiterated the World Health Organization’s position from early February that asymptomatic cases are “likely not a major driver of transmission” of the COVID-19 virus. Saturday’s study also described a so-called super-spreader in Ningbo, among the first such patients to be identified in China after similar cases were reported in India and South Korea. The Ningbo super-spreader infected 32 out of her 97 close contacts, yielding an infection rate of nearly 33% — far higher than the average infection rate of just over 6%. Despite the statistically insignificant difference in symptomatic and asymptomatic infection rates, the Ningbo researchers aren’t ready to draw sweeping conclusions just yet.  “Ningbo is a small sample of all cases in China, so our result doesn’t fully represent what’s happening in the country,” Chen said. “We look forward to seeing more data from our peers.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005404
COVID-19 and the Case for Empowering China’s CDC,"Supposedly tasked with disease control and prevention, the China CDC has been hobbled by a lack of authority and funding. Here’s how to fix it.",2020-03-28,"By December of last year, warning signs of the current COVID-19 pandemic had already begun flashing in the central city of Wuhan. In the months since, as the outbreak evolved first into an epidemic, and then a global pandemic, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has been vehemently criticized for not detecting COVID-19 and communicating the risks it posed to the public in a timely manner. In particular, many observers have expressed frustration at the apparent failure of the center’s electronic infectious disease reporting system, which was established in 2004 to rectify the reporting issues revealed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2003. There’s no doubt that the current pandemic has uncovered some of the defects in China’s epidemic reporting. Yet we shouldn’t rush to pin all the blame on the China CDC, which is beset by challenges both internal and external. Unlike the U.S. Centers for Disease Control which inspired it, the China CDC is not a government agency per se. Rather, it is more akin to a government-affiliated technical consulting organization. As such, it does not have the authority to publish information on infectious diseases and — in a redux of one of the longest-running conundrums in Chinese governance — it must rely on local health officials that it cannot necessarily control. China first established a national network of epidemic prevention stations modeled along Soviet lines in 1953. By 1957, these covered more than two-thirds of the nation’s counties, and together they ran vaccination campaigns like the one that eradicated smallpox in the country by 1960. But this system, with its emphasis on infectious diseases, gradually fell out of step with Chinese society. As citizens’ habits changed, noncommunicable diseases like cancer and heart disease became the leading causes of death in the country. Taking the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a model, China developed the China CDC out of a research center under its then-Ministry of Health in 2002. Now operated under the auspices of the National Health Commission, the China CDC is tasked with helping meet these new threats by leading and coordinating disease prevention and control efforts and providing technical guidance and support for China’s public health community. Almost immediately after the China CDC’s creation, it was confronted with the deadly outbreak of SARS. The epidemic killed 813 people worldwide between November 2002 and July 2003. Although the China CDC played a critical role in containing the disease, its early missteps in pinpointing the pathogen contributed to the steep toll. China responded by ramping up investment in infectious disease control. To address the need for enhanced disease surveillance systems, China launched a nationwide online system for reporting infectious disease cases and emerging public health events in 2004. By 2013, the system consisted of over 70,000 reporting units, including local CDCs and most of the country’s medical providers. But unlike the U.S. CDC, which is part of the federal government and has both the legal authority to quarantine patients who may pose risks to the population’s health across national or state borders and the ability to disburse federal funding to local health authorities, the China CDC is more of an auxiliary organization. It does not have the authority to publish information about outbreaks or take legal action to control them. Instead, these powers lie with the National Health Commission. Rather than direct the response, the China CDC can only collaborate with the local health authorities, who are the main actors during an outbreak. For example, the China CDC will provide technical guidance to provincial, prefectural, or county-level CDCs. But these usually report to their local health commissions, which fund and staff them, and which are subject to the control of local governments, who may have differing priorities in a crisis. Without leverage or legal powers, the China CDC’s recommendations can be brushed off — or its requests for information ignored, as seems to have been the case during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even before the current pandemic, however, the China CDC was already in crisis. The center had just 2,120 full-time employees in 2016, the last year for which numbers have been reported. That’s far fewer than the 11,195 full-time employees at its American counterpart, which also has access to several thousand contractors. A 2005 regulation blocking the China CDC and its local counterparts from charging service fees for administering vaccines also cost the organization an important source of revenue. Poor funding in non-epidemic circumstances, low salaries, and a lack of access to the stipends given to civil servants at full government agencies have pushed many experienced and capable staff to look for work elsewhere, including the private sector. The current situation jeopardizes China’s public health system. To address it, there needs to be more training and collaboration between local CDCs and hospitals, especially in the protocols for infectious disease reporting and the prevention and control of health care-associated infections. A world-class direct reporting system is fantastic, but it can only function properly if frontline health care providers have been trained in how to use it and maintain a close working relationship with their counterparts in local and national CDCs. National and local CDCs also need to be able to recruit and retain qualified professionals. The current pay for CDC system employees does not match the qualifications required, fueling a recent exodus of talented workers. It is past time to examine the CDC system pay scale and assess alternative mechanisms of recruiting and retaining talented staff, including merit pay. The China CDC should also strengthen its leadership of China’s public health sector. Upgrading the bureaucratic status of the China CDC and its local analogues would help facilitate timely communication and decision-making by shortening the chain of command. It would also be useful to clarify the legal powers of the China CDC when it comes to disease surveillance, data collection and transparency, and quarantine. Last but not least, the China CDC should improve its risk communication capabilities. Health communication is a burgeoning, multidisciplinary field that involves everything from behavioral science, communications, and public health. Health communication capacity is critical, not just for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but also for chronic conditions as well. China has reaped the benefits of industrialization and globalization that come with its increasingly interconnected position in the world. But a more mobile population brings with it a higher risk of emerging infectious diseases, while also increasing the human and economic costs of outbreaks. Whatever the next threat is, a strong public health institute — one with support from society, business, and government — will be vital to its prevention and control.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005370
"All Stung Out: China’s Bee Industry Crisis, Explained","The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating, but the beekeeping industry has been abuzz with discontent for years.",2020-03-27,"China’s beekeeping industry unexpectedly made headlines at the height of the country’s COVID-19 epidemic in February. After cities imposed strict lockdowns to contain the virus, beekeepers found themselves unable to move their colonies to new food sources. Faced with starving colonies and a devastating loss of income, an apiarist in the southwestern Yunnan province killed himself. China is the world’s leading honey producer with around 200,000 to 300,000 commercial beekeepers, many of whom live itinerant lives moving their migratory honey bees across the country in search of nectar. The industry is crucial to the economy: Around one-third of the plants consumed depends on pollination by managed or wild bees, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  Many Chinese beekeepers are now back on the road, with the country gradually lifting travel bans as the number of domestic COVID-19 cases dwindles. But the pandemic is not the only danger the industry faces. In this video, Sixth Tone explores why Chinese apiculture is under threat — and what needs to be done to protect it.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005393
China Banned Eating Wild Animals Amid COVID-19. What Happens Now?,China’s vast wildlife trade involves millions of people — and tens of millions of animals. Authorities are still working out how to deal with them.,2020-03-27,"Zhang Bo doesn’t know what he should do with the 500,000 frogs in his barn. The farmer has been breeding Asia bullfrogs for years to sell to wet markets and restaurants near his home in South China’s Guangdong province, where the amphibian is a popular delicacy. But on Jan. 26, China announced a nationwide ban on trading wild animals in response to the coronavirus pandemic, cutting off his business overnight. One month later, China’s top legislative body went further, banning all eating and related trading of terrestrial wildlife — whether wild or bred in captivity — effective immediately, warning violators would be punished severely. Now, Zhang faces a dilemma. He can’t sell his frogs and has already racked up debts of over 200,000 yuan ($28,300) buying feed for them. But he also doesn’t want his animals to starve.  “I’m worried, as the feed is running out,” the 33-year-old tells Sixth Tone. “My whole family relies on the business for their livelihoods.” Zhang’s troubles highlight the daunting challenge facing Chinese authorities as they attempt to dismantle the country’s vast market for wild animals, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of yuan. Many of the roughly 14 million people involved in wildlife breeding are based in poor rural areas that were heavily reliant on the industry. If the market isn’t phased out smoothly, experts warn the ban could cause severe side effects as breeders go bankrupt or try to continue selling on the black market.  China’s leaders have signaled in recent weeks that they’re fully committed to enforcing the ban to reduce the risk of future pandemics. As with the 2003 SARS crisis, scientists believe the coronavirus originated in bats and was passed on to humans via an intermediate host: Bamboo rats, badgers, pangolins, minks, and turtles have all been posited as possible intermediaries. On Feb. 3, Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered officials to crack down on markets selling animals illegally and eliminate people’s “bad habit of overeating wildlife.”  In the days following Xi’s speech, officials launched a massive inspection campaign targeting wet markets and restaurants known for selling exotic wildlife. By Feb. 27, around 350,000 venues had been “rectified” and 39,000 animals seized, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. But authorities have yet to confirm how they’ll deal with China’s thousands of breeding and trading businesses — and the animals under their control. The issue has sparked debate among industry insiders, policymakers, and conservationists, with some worrying overly harsh policies could harm local economies and be difficult to implement. Before the ban, the government had enthusiastically promoted the artificial breeding of wild animals as a “special industry,” seeing it as a method for reducing poverty in rural communities. China’s national forestry bureau named wildlife breeding a pillar industry in its five-year plan for 2011-2015, while the central government included it in its 2018 rural revitalization strategy. The industry has flourished over the past decade, and more than 100 species of wild animals are now artificially bred in China, according to Zhang Li, professor of life sciences at Beijing Normal University, who has no relation to frog-breeder Zhang Bo. The animals are mainly killed for their meat and fur, while some are used in laboratories or to make traditional Chinese medicine.  Some breeders even became celebrities, aided by state TV programs that touted raising bamboo rats and palm civets as a way for farmers to get rich. The Huanong Brothers, a pair of rat breeders from East China’s Jiangxi province, won a huge online following by documenting their lives on social media. (Since the ban, the brothers have been posting videos of themselves eating vegetables, rather than chubby rodents.) The ban, however, has left some communities in a precarious situation. Rao Xiaojian is head of a rural collective that bred masked palm civets for restaurants across southern China. At its height, the business employed hundreds of local families, and the area in Jiangxi became known as “China’s civet village.” In 2014, Rao was named a “young rural entrepreneurial leader” by the Chinese government. But the ban has been a “sudden disaster” for the village, Rao tells Sixth Tone. He has 90,000 unsold civets on his farm, and his neighbors are pressuring him to buy up their animals, too. Local snake, pheasant, and rat breeders are in the same position, he says. “The government told us to change careers, but I don’t know how,” says Rao. “All my facilities are for breeding civets, not ducks and chickens … And I still have several million yuan of debt.”  Liu Yongfu, director of the poverty alleviation office for the State Council, China’s Cabinet, who has no relation to Liu Jinmei, has suggested that breeders will receive government aid to transition into a new industry. But local officials are still scrambling to draw up workable plans to make this happen. “The ban came too soon,” says Ran Jingcheng, head of the Wild Animal and Plant Protection Administration Station in Southwest China’s Guizhou province. “(It’s) a sharp turn that’s hard to adapt to.” Low-income regions like Guizhou will struggle to pay farmers sufficient compensation unless they receive help from the central government, says Ran. His department has estimated that payments to the province’s breeders could cost as much as 2 billion yuan.  “If counties with no money have to accomplish the mission (to shut down breeding businesses), they may resort to coercive measures, which will only lose us popular support,” says Ran. Another concern is what to do with all the companies’ animals. According to Ran, there are 1.1 million wild animals bred for commercial use in Guizhou alone. “It’s not humane to kill them, and it’s not possible to release them (for fear of causing genetic pollution and destabilizing local ecosystems),” he says. According to Ran, officials are considering using the animals in exhibitions, to make medicine, or as food for zoo animals. “If there’s a three-year buffer period, there might not be too many conflicts,” says Ran. Another complication is that the government hasn’t yet confirmed a whitelist of species that will be exempt from the ban. At the moment, the only species allowed to be sold commercially for food are common domesticated animals such as cows, chickens, and pigs; unprotected fish and seafood species; and American bullfrogs, Chinese softshell turtles, and Chinese pond turtles. “It (the whitelist) needs to be completed quickly,” says Ran. The list, however, is already the subject of much wrangling. Industry insiders — and also some officials concerned about the economic impact of a total ban — argue that the government should focus on ensuring breeders meet high safety standards, rather than stamping out the entire market. Ran suggests the artificial breeding of certain species, for which companies already use mature technologies, could be classed as “special farming” and supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture.  But conservationists view an expansion of the whitelist as the thin end of the wedge. Many remember the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when Chinese authorities introduced a ban on the trade of wild animals for use as food, but later relaxed the policy after intense industry lobbying. An initial whitelist allowed businesses to legally breed and sell 54 species of wild animals, enabling the industry to continue expanding rapidly. Liu Yidan, an animal welfare campaigner with no relation to Liu Jinmei or Liu Yongfu, tells Sixth Tone watering down the ban could create legal loopholes and public health risks. In the past, communities proved adept at exploiting gaps in regulation, she says. Licensed breeders, for example, often provided cover for illegal poachers trafficking wild animals. “(Breeding) licenses became shields for the illegal wildlife trade,” says Liu Yidan. “Farmers have chat groups — just like we volunteers do — connecting people in the same business across the country. If someone is caught selling poached wild animals without a license, they claim the animals are from a licensed farm. They cover for each other.” “As long as the seller has a license, law enforcement officers won’t say a word, even if the animals have broken legs or are bleeding — a clear sign they were caught in the wild,” Liu Yidan says.  For Zhang Li, eating wild animals in any form poses a public health risk, given the lack of specialized standards and facilities for wildlife quarantine inspections. Opponents of the wildlife trade argue the government should not only refuse to lengthen the whitelist, but tighten restrictions still further by strengthening China’s wildlife protection law and updating its protection list. According to Zhang Li, the professor, the current law has failed to prevent protected species like the yellow-breasted bunting from being hunted almost to extinction. “The provisions are relatively weak,” he says. China also needs to integrate ecological and public health concerns into any revised wildlife protection law, according to Liu Jinmei, general counsel at Friends of Nature, a Beijing-based environmental nonprofit. She points out that, because the law focuses on protecting endangered species, it hasn’t prevented people from eating or hunting bats — which are riddled with dozens of potentially fatal diseases.  “We don’t want to manage the bats, but we must restrict human interaction with bats,” says Liu Jinmei. Which side wins out — the conservationists or the breeding industry — remains to be seen. For Zhang Li, the government has less of an incentive to make concessions to the industry today than in the wake of SARS, because the country is much richer. “Game animals are no longer a necessary source of protein, but luxury items in many areas,” says Zhang. “It’s rooted in the minds of some consumers that wild is better.” Liu Jinmei agrees that things will probably turn out differently this time. Compared with 2003, there is stronger support for a ban among the public and the government, she suggests. In an online poll conducted by National Business Daily Jan. 26, the day after the wildlife trade ban was announced, 55% of 125,000 respondents said they supported the government’s decision, while 44% said they hoped the suspension wouldn’t be permanent. “The tension is still there,” says Liu Jinmei. “But previously, the (opposing) voices from the (government) system and industry were overwhelming. This time, it’s more balanced.”  Back in Guangdong, Zhang Bo still has slim hopes that he might be allowed to restart his Asia bullfrog business one day. But in the meantime, he’s focusing on securing compensation if he can’t. The local government in his home city of Zhaoqing has published draft plans stating that wildlife breeders should shut down or move into other businesses, such as American bullfrogs, and be compensated according to the law. But there’s a potential snag: Zhang Bo and 20 other local Asia bullfrog breeders were operating without licenses. “I heard the licenses were too difficult to obtain, so I haven’t applied for one,” he says. The farmers have sent a petition letter to the local government explaining their situation and asking for financial aid. They’re still waiting for a reply. “If the worst happens, I'll look for a job to make a living,” says Zhang.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005389
"Four Vaccine Types That Could Stop the Coronavirus, Explained",Over 40 COVID-19 vaccines are currently being developed. Two have been administered to humans subjects in the U.S. and China.,2020-03-27,"With the COVID-19 pandemic posing an ever greater global threat, scientists are ramping up efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. There are many ways to make a vaccine, but the general idea is the same. When the immune system is exposed to a previously unknown pathogen, it usually takes a few days to train and deploy its soldiers against the invasive germ. Vaccines act like a practice drill for the immune system by exposing it to a weak, broken, or fake virus — so that when an actual infection happens, the immune system’s already-trained defenders are ready for the fight. According to the World Health Organization, over 40 types of COVID-19 vaccines are being developed worldwide. Most fall into one of four categories: attenuated, subunit, recombinant vector, and nucleic acid-based. Attenuated: Live but Frail Attenuated vaccines are live viruses that have been weakened in a laboratory. Scientists might grow the virus but not give it enough nutrients, for example. As a result, the virus, despite being viable, is too weak to cause disease. Many common vaccines, including the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and smallpox vaccines, are made with this technique. Attenuated vaccines can closely mimic real infections and are thus capable of inducing strong and long-lasting immunity in humans. On the flip side, however, because they involve a live virus, they can potentially pose health risks to people with weaker immune systems. U.S. biotech company Codagenix is collaborating with the Serum Institute of India to develop an attenuated vaccine against COVID-19, according to the WHO. Subunit: The Bait Subunit vaccines involve recipients being inoculated with only the part of the virus that elicits an immune response. This viral component is called an antigen, and it’s what the immune system uses to identify an invader. The immune system has an excellent memory of which antigens it has encountered. So when it detects a potentially harmful virus with a familiar antigen, it knows just how to respond. In the case of the COVID-19 virus, its antigen is a spiky protein on the cell surface. British pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline is reportedly collaborating with Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a company based in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, to develop a subunit vaccine based on the aforementioned spiky proteins. Recombinant Vector: The Sheep in Wolf’s Clothing Recombinant vector vaccines are made through genetic engineering. Similar to subunit vaccines, recombinant vector vaccines aim to expose the immune system to viral antigens. But instead of injecting the antigens directly, scientists take a snippet of the virus’ genetic code for the antigen and combine it with that of a harmless virus. The engineered virus can then express the antigen needed to generate an immune response without causing an infection. China’s first experimental vaccine approved for human trials uses this technique, with the team of researchers from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences inoculating their first volunteers last week. The study is aiming to recruit 108 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60, and to run from March 16 to Dec. 31. Nucleic Acid-Based: The Instruction Manual Nucleic acid-based vaccines are the newest vaccine category. They work by injecting parts of the virus’ genetic material, such as DNA or RNA segments, directly into the human body. For these vaccines, scientists tend to favor antigen genes, which are essentially encyclopedias containing all the information needed to recreate antigens once they’re inside human cells. This technique has only been explored for the last 20 years or so, and thus no DNA or RNA vaccines have yet been approved for human use. But nucleic acid-based vaccines are time savers, as researchers don’t have to grow viral components on a massive scale in the lab. Instead, this process takes place directly within human hosts. Cutting production time is crucial for vaccine development during a pandemic. For this reason, dozens of pharmaceutical companies are eyeing a nucleic acid-based COVID-19 vaccine. The first U.S.-developed experimental COVID-19 vaccine given to humans is an RNA vaccine made by the Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. In China, meanwhile, Fudan University is collaborating with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and RNACure Biopharma, a local biotech firm, to develop an RNA vaccine, though human trials are still pending. Vaccine development is a time-consuming process. Most of the projects that have been announced are still in the early stages, such as testing on animal models. Despite the global effort, only two COVID-19 vaccines have entered early-stage human trials.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005398
"COVID-19 Leaves Scars on the Spirit, Too",A recovered COVID-19 patient reflects on his time in the ICU.,2020-03-27,"On Wednesday, authorities in the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the country’s COVID-19 epidemic started, began rolling back transportation restrictions designed to check the spread of the coronavirus. The announcement, which will extend to the 11 million-strong city of Wuhan from April 8, suggests Chinese officials are growing increasingly confident that they have successfully brought the outbreak under control. In Wuhan, which had recorded around 50,000 infections and more than 2,500 COVID-19-related deaths as of Friday, many recovered patients have returned home after spending weeks in hospitals and quarantine stations. Although they crave a return to normalcy, some of them continue to experience the scars of disease and ostracism from their communities. One of those is Li, a 70-year-old retiree who requested his full name not be published to avoid further discrimination. His interview with financial outlet Caixin has been edited for length, and has been republished here with permission. The Onset On Jan. 18, I went to a crowded exhibition at a Wuhan bookstore. I started feeling sick that night: I had a low fever, felt listless, and had sore muscles. The following day, I went to the hospital. Doctors told me that many patients had fevers like mine and that I should stay home, rest, and take the medicine they gave me. Within a few days, my fever was joined by an upset stomach and wheezing. On Jan. 22, I went back to the hospital. It was completely crammed: I waited from the late afternoon until midnight before I finally saw a doctor, who immediately told me there were no beds. As I got home that night, the authorities implemented a citywide lockdown of Wuhan. By Jan. 26, I was feeling terrible. There were no cars available, so I walked slowly back to the hospital, where a CT scan showed I had an infection in both lungs with white patches that looked like ground-up glass — one of the hallmarks of COVID-19. That’s when I realized I had the disease, but again I was informed that the hospital was already full. Knowing I might never recover without immediate hospitalization, I frantically called anyone I knew with medical connections. A friend told me that another hospital was about to open a new ward to deal with the surge in patients. I rushed over there and was lucky enough to get a bed in the intensive care unit. The ward was completely full, and the facilities were extremely basic. Within a few days of being admitted into the ICU, I watched the elderly man in the bed next to mine die. In the early hours of Jan. 29, I suddenly smelled something foul and turned to see him lying rigid and shuddering. He was fighting so hard to breathe that he had lost continence. Although I rang the bell for a doctor, nobody came. I could only hold his hand and speak to him as he slipped away. He must have been so lonely without his family beside him. I stayed in the ICU for eight days. During that time, I think eight patients there died.  A Brush With Death By my second day in the ICU, I was running a fever of 38 degrees Celsius, had a terrible stomach, and, worst of all, felt constantly winded. I got along well with the ward’s medical staff. I enjoyed chatting with the doctors about my condition and kept thanking them and telling them how well they were doing. Nobody knows exactly how to treat this emerging disease, so I felt it was important to praise the doctors and nurses and raise their confidence. I didn’t have much of an appetite for the first few days, but I forced myself to eat, knowing it was important for my recovery. In fact, my overeating and lack of exercise created a different problem. Before the pandemic, I had been told I have an impaired sugar tolerance — my doctors say it’s an early sign of diabetes. One night, I suddenly felt fiercely itchy all over. I scratched and scratched until I drew blood but couldn’t subdue the itch. After about an hour, I fell back exhausted. I was cold, especially in my chest, which felt like ice. My whole body felt empty, as if I was floating away. The sensation was one of total absolution as death drew near. After a period of confusion, I suddenly wondered if what I was experiencing was something called ketoacidosis, which can occur in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes when your insulin levels drop and your body starts burning fat as fuel. Two things happen: Your blood sugar levels spike, and acidic substances are released into your blood. I forced myself upright and downed a cup of water. With no doctors around, I staggered to where they kept some supplies and tested my blood sugar. The reading was 28.9. My normal level is about 6. Knowing I had to rapidly bring down my blood sugar level, I injected myself with several doses of insulin from the supply station. Then I drank some more water and returned to bed. Gradually, I began to feel better. In the morning, when a doctor next came to the ward, I told him what had happened and asked him to measure my blood sugar again: 8.9. The doctor said I’d probably saved my own life. After eight days in the ICU, my pneumonia symptoms subsided and my nucleic acid test (NAT) came back negative. I was finally transferred to the isolation ward. A few of my friends weren’t so lucky. As far as I know, at least five people in my amateur photography group have died since the outbreak started.  A Long Road to Recovery After returning four more negative NATs in the isolation ward, I finally left the hospital on Feb. 14. I was looking forward to getting back to normal; I didn’t think I’d end up feeling even more alone. One of the many things we don’t know about COVID-19 is whether it leaves people with lifelong ailments. I’m now about 18 kilograms lighter than when I went into the hospital, can’t breathe as freely as before, and often feel as though my windpipe and throat are blocked. We also don’t know if people who have recovered from the disease can catch it again. After leaving the hospital, I spent 14 days quarantining at a hotel. I had to be very careful about coming home. I didn’t want to infect my wife, who has long-standing respiratory problems. Since I returned, we’ve confined ourselves to separate rooms and worn masks around the house. This disease tests your spirit as much as your body, because it forces you to stay apart from others. I particularly miss my dear little sister, who would often call round at our house. Since the outbreak started, I haven’t seen or spoken to her once. Perhaps she thinks it would be unlucky to contact me now. People outside the family shun recovered patients like me as well. Before I got sick, I was enjoying a full and happy retirement. On the social messaging app WeChat, I was a keen member of group chats for photography, swimming, cycling, and outdoor climbing. Now, those chats are silent. All of this makes me very sad. The people I’m fondest of have effectively isolated me, leaving me with nobody to speak to. When I do communicate with others, I can see by their words and actions that they don’t want to be there. Everyone seems to think I pose a risk to their health, so in that sense, my recovery has only been temporary. In the month since I got out of the hospital, I’ve briefly left the house four times — to charge my electric scooter, get a health code, collect some food, and collect medicine from the hospital. Each time, the people I’ve dealt with — neighbors, community volunteers, hospital staff — have recoiled from me or barked at me to stand farther away from them. I feel like a plague victim. All my life, I’ve loved being around other people. Since retiring, my life has been rich in group activities. But until society is ready to accept me again, I won’t be attending events with lots of people. I don’t want to make them feel uneasy. I’m looking forward to going back out with my camera after Wuhan lifts its lockdown. But I’ll be doing it alone. Contributions: Xiao Hui and Matthew Walsh.

Li Jiaqi Hosts Charity Livestream for Hubei Products,"After weeks of struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic, Hubei businesses are getting a little help from China’s star streamer.",2020-03-27,"“This is really yummy — it’s so good!” Li Jiaqi says, wiping his mouth with a napkin after taking a big bite of “hot and dry noodles,” a Wuhanese delicacy. The 27-year-old commercial livestreamer checks the product’s remaining stock and frowns. “Oh, is it already sold out? Let’s ask them to add more.” The two-and-a-half-hour livestream, titled “Hubei Charity Special Live Broadcast,” garnered more than 13 million views on Thursday. Li “the lipstick prince” Jiaqi is one of the most famous commercial livestreamers in China, and lately he’s been using his star power to promote several Hubei brands including beverages, snacks, and other foods, as well as cosmetics and skin care products. Exclusive gifts are promised to customers ordering from Hubei, the central province where China’s coronavirus cases are most concentrated. At one point, Li notes that he and his team are not accepting profits from the special broadcast. “During the pandemic, Hubei companies — especially those in Wuhan — are having a hard time, and we are still fighting to save ourselves,” said a spokesperson for the hot and dry noodles brand. She told Sixth Tone that Li’s broadcast was a source of “positive support” but declined to elaborate on sales, saying only that the company “really appreciated it.” During a previous livestream Wednesday night, Li had hinted to his viewers about Thursday’s special steam. “We hope to cheer Hubei up,” he said. Then in a post Thursday afternoon on microblogging platform Weibo, Li let the cat out of the bag. “The special live broadcast for Hubei has finally arrived,” he said. “We hope to help Hubei businesses that have resumed production sell some products and walk away from the impact of the pandemic as soon as possible.”  A Wuhan resident surnamed Wu was among the viewers of Thursday’s livestream. She was excited after learning about the special broadcast, as delivery services to the province have been affected by the pandemic over the past two months. After Wuhan went under lockdown Jan. 23, delivery services to the province were gradually suspended, dramatically limiting the range of products local residents could purchase online. Wu is a fan of Li’s livestreams and claims to watch his broadcasts every night. “I always like everything Li Jiaqi recommends,” she told Sixth Tone. Many of the products Li has been promoting come with extra gifts for customers ordering from Hubei, Wu said, adding that she had bought some loose makeup powder featured on one of Li’s streams. Though Wu ordered the product in February, it didn’t arrive until weeks later — but when it did, the package also contained alcohol wipes, hand sanitizer, and a letter of encouragement as extra gifts from the merchant. “I was very touched,” she said. “I felt like they had really put their heart into it.” For customers, it’s the products’ prices as much as the way Li promotes them that grabs their attention. “It’s super cost-effective to buy things from his live broadcast, which gives a lot of gifts,” Wu said. “The products are always high-quality and cheaper.” The reason for this comes down to commercial livestreamers and their agencies having leverage over merchants when negotiating prices and extra gifts to be included especially for the livestream, said Chen Tao, a senior e-commerce industry analyst at consulting firm Analysys. According to Chen, the online format is a good platform for connecting merchants with customers. “Livestreaming’s impact on stimulating the overall economy may not be significant, as offline sales are still the driving force,” Chen told Sixth Tone. “But livestreaming on e-commerce platforms brings efficient interaction between consumers and merchants.” Internet promotions also provide a window for consumers to learn more about the merchants, which could have a positive impact on their short-term sales, Chen said. Online retail accounts for around 20% of all commercial sales in China, according to Chen. However, the pandemic may accelerate changing consumption habits in the long run, with people becoming more accustomed to online shopping during this temporary period and therefore more inclined to shop online after the crisis blows over. For Li’s part, he hopes his broadcasts can restore consumer confidence in Hubei brands and support them as they resume business. “We hope today’s livestreaming can make people feel warm,” Li says toward the end of the livestream. “The spring has come and the flowers are in bloom, and everything will definitely get better.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005392
Foreigners Collateral Damage as China Curbs Imported Infections,"Despite Chinese nationals accounting for the vast majority of COVID-19 cases arriving from abroad, foreigners are being singled out as infection risks.",2020-03-27,"Late Thursday, China’s foreign ministry announced that the country would temporarily bar most foreign nationals from entry. The policy — which affects nonlocals with valid visas or residence permits but not diplomats or emergency humanitarian personnel — was taken “in light of the outbreak situation and the practices of other countries,” according to the official notice. With COVID-19 spreading rapidly abroad and the U.S. now reporting the most infections of any country worldwide, China has taken increasingly stringent measures to limit imported infections. As these measures have taken effect, however, foreigners in the country have reported being barred from entering hotels, banks, office buildings, gyms, spas, restaurants, and shops, regardless of their travel history. One widely shared photo of a printed sign in a Beijing shop window reads: “We do not accept foreign friends and people whose temperature is above 37.3 (degrees Celsius) temporarily.”  ""We do not accept foreign friends...""Just learned this sign is posted in a shop in our Beijing apartment complex. Pass that place every day but have never gone inside. Guess I never will! pic.twitter.com/P371mVQedj  A South African teacher who has lived in China for three years told Sixth Tone that when she tried to book a sugar wax at a hotel over the weekend, she was told the business wasn’t accepting foreigners. “I was mad! I’ve been in Shanghai this whole time — I have the green QR code!” she said, referring to a government health-monitoring system accessible within Alipay and WeChat, China’s two dominant all-purpose apps. Like most of the foreigners Sixth Tone interviewed for this story, the teacher would only speak on condition of anonymity. A French national who works in the food and beverage industry and has lived in China for over 16 years told Sixth Tone by phone that he had recently hoped to return to his house in the island province of Hainan, where he likes to surf. But when he contacted property management over WeChat, they told him he shouldn’t come because he is a foreigner, without inquiring about his recent travel history. “To me, that’s pretty racist. I was obviously shocked, because it’s my place – it’s not like I rent it,” said the man, who holds permanent residence in China. “I was pretty upset about it because my family’s Chinese, my wife is Chinese. I’ve got two kids, they’re mixed. I’ve been here a long time. I’m one of the old crew when it comes to foreigners.” He said he believes such incidents during the coronavirus pandemic are rooted in fear, and that this can manifest as irrational decision-making. Although China’s foreign ministry says foreigners have accounted for just 11% of all imported COVID-19 cases, some countries’ belated, ineffective, and even head-scratching responses to the virus, along with spikes in infections abroad, have contributed to rising xenophobia in China. “People don’t think straight when things are like this,” said the food and beverage professional.  Zinta, a Latvian national, recounted a recent meal she had to eat on the street outside a restaurant in the southwestern city of Chengdu while her Chinese husband and daughter dined inside because a scannable QR code granting entry at the door required that users input a Chinese ID number. Zinta told Sixth Tone the restaurant staff gave her a stool and chair: one to sit on, one to use as a table. “My husband was passing the food through the window to me,” she said. Sixth Tone also received several reports of foreigners being barred from their reopening gyms. A teacher from Manchester in the U.K. showed Sixth Tone a text message from his Shanghai gym where he’s been a member for three years. “Right now, the government has expressly requested that we don’t allow foreigners to enter,” the message said. “We need to follow regulations; otherwise, they won’t allow us to operate. As compensation, foreigners are being given an extra month of membership.” After some negotiating — sending staff his green health code over WeChat and explaining that another gym nearby was allowing foreigners — the teacher was told he could come back. A personal trainer at Will’s, a popular gym chain in China, told Sixth Tone she had not heard of such exclusionary policies.  Sixth Tone called 10 hotels in central Shanghai and asked whether a British national who hasn’t been abroad this year would be allowed to make a booking. Six said yes — provided the guest’s passport corroborated their travel history, or lack thereof — while three said not at this time. The last hotel said it was only accepting foreigners for two-week bookings — the standard quarantine period — with no leaving the room allowed during that time. One hotel staff member said police were only permitting foreigners to stay in around 20 designated hotels. When Sixth Tone called Shanghai’s immigration authorities and a local police office, people who answered the phone said they weren’t clear on the current policies regarding foreigners. The Shanghai Call Center, a hotline providing assistance to residents in a dozen languages, told Sixth Tone that there is no citywide policy for where foreigners are and aren’t allowed, and that each residential community sets its own regulations. The receptionist added that foreigners should not encounter problems booking accommodation at hotels that are licensed to accept foreigners, provided they can show green health-tracker codes.  Nevertheless, some foreigners feel they’re being treated like disease-carriers. A British head of technical at a clothing company in Shanghai told Sixth Tone that she was initially not allowed into a branch of one of China’s largest banks on Saturday because of confusion over the entry and exit stamps in her and her husband’s passports. After the branch manager finally allowed them in, she said staff tried to direct them to a separate space because they were Westerners, and therefore might alarm the other customers. When she refused, they were served alongside everyone else. “I felt like a leper, actually,” said the woman. “It was all a bit ridiculous.” Several foreigners told Sixth Tone they had witnessed locals immediately exit an elevator after they walked in. The British woman said she was refused by three drivers she booked using the popular ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, and had noticed many people moving far away from her on the subway. Her company advised her not to mingle with other foreigners, the woman said, and is considering requiring all staff to disclose, on a weekly basis, the names and nationalities of the people they interact with outside of the office. “I’ve been here 10 years and never had a single issue,” she said. “I’ve never felt uncomfortable until recently.”  Since the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, xenophobia and discrimination have been on the rise globally, with ethnic Chinese and Asian people more broadly bearing the brunt. Cases of racism, verbal abuse, passive-aggressive behaviors, and physical violence and intimidation against groups such as Chinese students have shot up. Last week, police in the English city of Southampton arrested three boys aged 11 to 13 in connection with a racially motivated attack on a group of young Chinese people who had been wearing face masks. By comparison, incidents of malicious discrimination against foreigners in China are far less common. In researching this article, Sixth Tone was proactively contacted by several foreigners living in China who said they have not experienced discrimination during the pandemic. Some told anecdotes of acts of kindness by their Chinese neighbors, such as being brought food and medicine during their home quarantines. “This is a time when everyone should be working together. Foreigners, Chinese — it doesn’t matter. If there are rules, we follow them,” said Zinta, the woman from Latvia. “I hope people will not be afraid of each other, because we all are humans. We need to be kind to one another.”  helps explain outbreak control policies to other foreigners living in a residential community in Shanghai, March 18, 2020.

Notes on COVID-19 and the Abrupt Digitization of Learning,The coronavirus has closed classrooms and forced education online. A professor reflects on what’s been lost in the transition.,2020-03-26,"I have been an associate professor at China’s Zhejiang University for over a decade, but the current semester — only a month old — has presented even an experienced teacher such as myself with plenty of novel challenges. On the very first day of class, I was sitting in front of my computer, trying to focus on the screen in front of me, when out of the corner of my eye I saw my elementary school-aged daughter sneak into my room and strut around. In that moment, it was like my brain short-circuited: I suddenly knew exactly how “BBC Dad” Robert Kelly must have felt during his famous interview. With schools across China temporarily unable to open their doors because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Education in late January unveiled what it termed its “suspending school, not learning” policy. Among other proposals, the policy called for a massive expansion of online teaching at all levels. By the time my university started online classes on Feb. 24, I was already familiar with some of the different platforms available: Primary schools in Zhejiang had started about a week prior, and I had sat in on some of my daughter’s virtual lessons while she got accustomed to the new system. So instead of worrying about the technical side of things, I was more concerned with how I was supposed to squeeze a makeshift recording studio into my family’s tiny living quarters. I already felt like I was living in a miniature internet café: My daughter had to take classes online; my wife was telecommuting and participating in frequent conference calls; and now I was expected to be a livestreamer. But after spending three afternoons a week lecturing into the empty air of my bedroom, I do think I have a better understanding of what the digitalized future of teaching the humanities may look like. The first thing I noticed was that online teaching lacks the usual sense of ritual and focus of the classroom. I was struck by how a seemingly simple spatial shift — moving from one’s home or dormitory to a classroom, for example — could help solidify a corresponding shift in social roles from civilian to student or teacher. You lose this feeling when classes are held online. For teachers, the journey becomes a walk from your bedroom to your living room or study, or vice-versa, in my case; for students, perhaps from their bed to their couch or desk. (Though I did notice some students opting to partake in class directly from the comfort of their mattresses.) Online teaching also has a way of removing the most basic human and emotional exchanges from the classroom atmosphere. Although I don’t consider myself a controlling classroom manager, I miss the silent communication of the lecture hall. I’m not sure if this is a cultural thing or not, but in China, at least, most teachers and students seem to tacitly agree that audio streams are sufficient. But because teachers now can’t see anything — or have a very limited and grainy view of their students — the content and pace of the class cannot be adjusted based on student expressions or body language.  The pauses I used to leave in my lectures seem abrupt once transferred online, and my attempts to liven the atmosphere with an occasional joke come off as awkward. No matter how hard I try, it’s impossible to break through the wall of silence in front of my screen. Students’ feedback is essentially restricted to “likes” or comments. Finally, online teaching models tend to infringe on student and teacher autonomy and comfort due to technological surveillance. Online teaching platforms objectively require more work than their analog counterparts. Such platforms often provide predetermined modules for teachers to fill in, such as “coursework,” “discussion,” and “reference.” Although not specifically required by schools, the design of the platform exerts a silent pressure on teachers to fill these spaces. While this may result in a more disciplined and standardized teaching plan, it comes at the cost of flexibility and autonomy. Meanwhile, we must record entire classes for students to watch or listen to at their convenience. Data on student playback is naturally also recorded. This information can help teachers understand how and when students are learning, but it also creates a virtual panopticon that is not exactly conducive to feelings of comfort or security. I keep checking myself mid-lecture as I consider who might one day see or hear the thing I am about to say. Ultimately, livestreaming technology may be better suited to courses that require a lot of writing on the blackboard or laboratory demonstrations. For the humanities, however, I tend to see them as a stopgap measure at best and not something that can replace classroom instruction. On a conceptual level, the humanities focuses on inquiries into the relationship between the self and the world, society and nature. In place of the experiments found in the natural sciences, or the empirical evidence and fieldwork of the social sciences, it encourages solitary reading and contemplation. So perhaps we should be looking at other ideas. The current quarantine offers a perfect opportunity for students to free themselves from their usual hectic university lives and engage in quality reading and reflection on the issues raised by the pandemic. The literature department of Sun Yat-sen University in the southern city of Guangzhou offers an example of what this might look like. Instead of online classes, it recommended a list of over 100 books to students and encouraged them to read and write at home. The idea is, quite frankly, impressive. But it also makes intuitive sense: Reading, thinking, and writing can be carried out independently, so why not allow students to study on their own and hone their independent reading and thinking skills? Unlike most classes — the lessons of which students may forget as soon as they’re out the classroom door — the impressions they form at this critical time will likely be with them for life. The pandemic offers us a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of matters like the fragility of human life, the relationship between fate and social systems, and freedom of speech. If the questions posed by literature can sometimes feel abstract or theoretical, experiences such as these bring them home and can effectively shape how we understand and respond to them. For now, my students and I are eagerly awaiting the end of the pandemic and a return to our beautiful campus: to a world where people can face each other, not perfectly or even efficiently, perhaps, but with emotion and spontaneity.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005369
"China’s Medics Were Paid Less During the Pandemic, Survey Says",Over 80% of medical workers say their incomes have declined since the country’s battle against COVID-19 began.,2020-03-25,"China’s medical workers have had to cope with a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic, from brutal hours to the constant fear of infection. Now, many are also having to deal with an unexpected pay cut. Over 80% of medics have seen their incomes drop due to a reduction in their basic salaries or bonuses since the coronavirus outbreak began in January, according to a survey of 742 medical workers published Sunday by DXY.cn, a leading health care provider and online community for physicians. In some cases, doctors’ wages have been impacted by hospitals’ decisions to cancel nonessential procedures. A surgeon at a top-tier hospital in Shanghai — which is not one of the city’s two designated facilities for treating COVID-19 patients — told Sixth Tone his employer had canceled his “attendance bonus” for this reason. “As Shanghai’s hospitals greatly reduced the number of surgeries during the special period of COVID-19 out of fear of cross infections inside hospitals, I’ve been scheduled to work fewer days during the past month,” said the doctor, who agreed to an interview on condition of anonymity. “But it was a decision made by the hospital management — it wasn’t our intention to work less.” Another doctor surnamed Huang, who works at a district-level hospital in Shanghai, said the decrease in the number of patients at her outpatient cardiology department had impacted the department’s overall revenues. “As a result, the bonuses for regular doctors in our department have dropped, even though our basic salaries have remained the same,” Huang told Sixth Tone. State-supported financial subsidies and performance-based bonuses have become increasingly important to doctors’ incomes in recent years, as China tries to find ways to boost medics’ notoriously low wages. The starting salary for a junior doctor in China is only around 4,860 yuan ($680) per month — significantly lower than Shanghai’s average graduate starting salary of 6,000 yuan. The Chinese government has promised to grant special subsidies to frontline doctors and nurses. In February, officials announced that each frontline medical worker would receive 200-300 yuan for each day they were in contact with infected patients. Many medical workers complained to DXY.cn, however, that they hadn’t received the money as of March 10. A doctor working at a rural health center in Jinzhai County in the eastern Anhui province told Sixth Tone that none of the doctors at the hospital have received the subsidies. “I have been in contact with two confirmed (COVID-19) patients and still haven’t seen a penny,” said the doctor, who asked not to be identified. According to a March notice issued by the central government, frontline medics are defined as those who have had “direct contact” with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases, and should be prioritized when disbursing allowances and subsidies. “To my knowledge, only doctors working at our hospital’s fever clinic have received certain subsidies,” said Huang. The definition of “frontline doctors” has left some doctors feeling bitter. Several have pointed out that even medics who haven’t had direct contact with infected patients have been working around-the-clock during the pandemic. “In some towns, even though there are no confirmed cases, the doctors there are just as busy as us,” said the Jinzhai doctor, who has been living in the hospital and hasn’t returned home once since the virus reached his township in January.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005378
China’s Virus-Stricken Clothing Industry Struggles to Mend,"As domestic apparel and textile businesses slowly recover, the sector must now cope with global fallout.",2020-03-25,"Before China’s vast clothing industry had the chance to recover from the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many firms have been forced to cope with uncertainties from abroad as the intensifying pandemic impacts global supply chains. In southern China’s Guangdong province, a major clothing and textile hub, over 60% of export-oriented firms said their overseas orders have declined, according to a survey by the Guangdong Clothing and Apparel Industry Association in early March. Amid the still-recovering domestic supply chain, businesses — especially the more vulnerable smaller firms — are facing issues with stockpiling, tight cash flow, and reduced staff, according to the industry trade group. From brands to wholesalers, reduced trade and delayed manufacturing for both upstream and downstream factories continue to cloud the market. Lu Jianxin, a logistics executive of a Shanghai-based clothing label, told Sixth Tone that his company has been relying on e-commerce platforms to unload overstock, as brick-and-mortar stores have not yet rebounded from their stagnation. Most of the brand’s overseas stores have also been closed, Lu said. “We’ve lost the spring and summer seasons; now we’ll look to the fall and winter,” said Lu. “It’s best if the fall and winter seasons can be salvaged, but to be honest, there is too much pressure.”  Things have taken a sharp turn for many other businesses, too. As China grappled with its escalating coronavirus outbreak, road restrictions and strict approval systems to resume work posed difficulties for firms aiming to deliver overseas orders. Companies are now scrambling to restore normalcy, but many are stuck as partners abroad cancel orders amid reduced consumer confidence and citywide lockdowns. Various international trade sectors in China have been met with dwindling orders from European and U.S. markets, according to financial news outlet Caixin. The Shanghai branch of Li & Fung, a global consumer goods supply chain manager, told the outlet that since earlier this month, many of its orders have been canceled or delayed. The company expects the trend to continue as the pandemic intensifies worldwide. According to brokerage firm Everbright Securities, China’s clothing and textile industries are closely tied to Italy and Japan, which are now battling COVID-19 themselves. One down-garment maker told domestic media outlet Caijing that it has become difficult to send samples and materials to Italy, and he worries that the mounting pressure could affect the status of his current and future orders. Among the most anxious are the many firms doing subcontract work for international brands. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, trade friction between China and the United States had cast a shadow over the clothing industry, as many businesses rely on international subcontracting. Zhu Guohui, who owns a knitwear supplier in the southern megacity of Shenzhen, told Sixth Tone that his firm works with brands in New York City, but business has been suffering since 2018 due to increased customs taxes and fewer orders. Amid mounting pressure, Zhu eventually closed his factory last year and is now waiting for the chance to take his business online. “Except for the internet, I think that other traditional business models (in the clothing industry) are all difficult to manage,” said Zhu. Growing pressure accelerated by the pandemic could threaten the survival of many small- and medium-sized firms, according to experts. “Changes in some foreign industries will have a great impact on our domestic clothing industry,” said Hu Xiaohui, an economist at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics. However, Hu remains optimistic about the industry’s long-term prospects. With many clothing brands having already shifted their manufacturing bases from China to Southeast Asia, the pandemic might serve as a wake-up call for Chinese firms to tap into the domestic market and adapt to new trends, according to Hu. “A small boat is easy to turn around. They will eventually find a way,” Hu said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005376
"Inside Wuhan’s Quarantine Centers, People Wait, Hope, and Wait","For COVID-19 patients, the road to recovery ends with two weeks under observation.",2020-03-25,"Ten days into her quarantine, Zhang Meng laid on her bed in a university dorm room and stared at the ceiling light in disbelief. Her transfer from the hospital to this makeshift quarantine center should have meant she was just two weeks away from going home. But her test for the virus that causes COVID-19 had just returned positive, and so her return date was pushed back even further. Zhang’s temporary home, at Hubei University in Wuhan, the city in central China’s Hubei province where the COVID-19 epidemic began late last year, is the largest of more than 300 such sites around the city. Of them, many universities and vocational colleges, whose dormitories — as well as empty hotels — have become quarantine sites to deal with the large number of infected and potentially infected people in the city.  As the pace of the virus’ spread within China has slowed, the country is still processing the thousands of people who are recovering from COVID-19. These patients, as well as the people they potentially infected, need to go through a mandatory two-week observation period to make sure they are virus-free. Quarantine sites in Wuhan currently still house some 20,000 people. They are discharged after they are symptom-free and test negative for the coronavirus in two consecutive exams administered 24 hours apart. After Zhang and her husband were first diagnosed with COVID-19, they were admitted to a so-called shelter hospital, another part of Wuhan’s temporary health care system set up to deal with the rapid increase in infections. (Zhang, like all patients in this story, requested the use of a pseudonym out of privacy concerns). People with mild COVID-19 symptoms are treated in these makeshift medical facilities so as to leave hospital beds for the more seriously ill.  When their symptoms subsided, Zhang and her husband became two of 1,300 patients housed in the Hubei University dormitories, each with their own separate room to prevent more infections. The couple lived on the same floor and could see each other only when they left their room — face masks on — to receive meals, or when they collected hot water. Sometimes, they could chat in the corridor for a few minutes. It has been an emotional time for Zhang, whose parents were also infected. Her mother has since died from COVID-19, while her father remains hospitalized with severe symptoms. Liu Aifen, 67, was one of hundreds of people undergoing quarantine in the student dormitories of Wuhan Vocational College of Software and Engineering. Before she arrived, staff had prepared daily necessities: toothpaste, toothbrush, slippers, washbasin, soap.  Liu has kept it hidden from friends and family that she, her husband, son, and daughter-in-law all contracted the new coronavirus. She doesn’t want to worry them, but she’s also afraid of how people would react. Once at the quarantine center, Liu talked with a man who hadn’t himself tested positive, but was being observed because he had been close to an infected person. After Liu told him she’d gotten infected, he immediately changed his attitude and left in a hurry. It made Liu decide that, after she was discharged and returned home, she wouldn’t meet any friends and relatives for the remainder of the year. On March 17, the government announced that, for the first time since the outbreak began, the total number of suspected infections in Hubei province had reached zero. Though there are still fears of transmissions by “silent carriers” — people infected with the coronavirus who aren’t showing any symptoms — a return to normality for the hard-hit region seems close. On Tuesday, the government announced that the two-months-long lockdowns of Wuhan and other cities in the province would begin to loosen on April 8 and March 25, respectively. In the end, Zhang spent 22 days at the center before she was cleared to leave. She is now back home, but she’s still far from being physically — or emotionally — recovered and needs to go through a final quarantine period. “Even though I’m back home, I can’t go out,” Zhang says. “It’s still not the same.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005381
"500 Cinemas Reopen in China, Earn $10,000 in First Weekend","Despite numerous measures to help domestic movie theaters stay afloat, managers expect trying times for the foreseeable future.",2020-03-25,"China’s cities are creaking back to life as businesses resume normal or near-normal operations. For the country’s movie theaters, however, there’s little light at the end of the tunnel. More than 500 movie theaters in China have resumed business, but total domestic box office revenue last weekend was just 72,400 yuan ($10,000), according to online ticketing platform Maoyan. With local film bureaus and audiences taking a cautious tack, theater chains are also coping with strict reopening requirements and facing mounting, unprecedented challenges. Financial news outlet Securities Daily reported that, for the week beginning March 16, just 4.8% of domestic theaters resumed operations, taking in a combined 118,200 yuan at the box office from 3,810 tickets. Movie theaters in the northwestern Xinjiang region were the first in the country to resume business earlier this month, followed by theaters in other provincial-level regions including Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Henan, and Fujian, according to China News Service. Meanwhile, local authorities in cities like Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, and Changchun have also issued notices allowing movie theatres to reopen. A Xinjiang-based movie theater manager surnamed Dong told China News Service that his theater had received fewer than 100 daily visits since reopening, and that its daily box office earnings were between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan. Only a few rooms were opened for screenings, Dong said, and only for half a day from 2 p.m. The theater has also followed strict outbreak control policies such as checking customers’ body temperature and recording their personal information, according to Dong. A movie theater manager surnamed Wang in the city of Hulunbuir in Inner Mongolia told Sixth Tone that his theater opened on March 20 and began screening the December 2019 release “Sheep Without a Shepherd,” which had its theatrical run extended. However, the theater — which has seven screening rooms and 948 seats — has only received 40 visits per day on average, Wang said. “We follow the instructions (from local film bureaus), selling nonadjacent seats in every other row. We also disinfect (the screening rooms) every two hours,” Wang said. “In general, the disinfection and management aren’t too difficult: The main problem is that we have too few customers.” Some previously released movies including sci-fi blockbuster “The Wandering Earth” and Lebanese drama “Capernaum” have been rereleased domestically, with all box office revenue going directly to the theaters to support their recovery. Wang says he’s hoping for some new movies to be released soon, as the old titles don’t exactly have audiences chomping at the bit to visit. However, film production companies and distributors may be loath to release new films, given the current climate, Zhang Yi, a senior analyst at online consulting firm iiMedia Research Group, told Sixth Tone. According to Zhang, movie theaters in China’s megacities are reluctant to reopen, too, given their relatively higher risk of imported infections. “Although the (outbreak) situation in other regions has been improved and the risk is low, distributors would not just release new films there, where consumption capacity is relatively low,” he said. “Also, once a movie is released, the resource is exposed: If it’s not consistent nationwide, it will be hard to earn enough to cover costs.” Meanwhile, China’s film industry is also struggling to churn out new creative content, with production halted nationwide since early February. In recent years, movie production companies, in conjunction with distributors, have followed exhaustive long-term schedules for setting release dates and meeting filming deadlines; however, the pandemic has thrown an enormous wrench into these plans. A screenwriter and producer who prefers to be identified with her pen name, Yidie, told Sixth Tone that her production team isn’t expecting to resume work on a new film project until late April. “The pandemic interrupted our original plan — we postponed a casting call event and press conferences, and the new dates can’t be set yet,” she said. “For cinematic releases, the most important issue is securing funds from investors. We have to first sort out the investment and shooting plan, then talk to the distributors about the release.” Eyeing the long run, Zhang, the analyst, suggests that movie theaters could consider selling monthslong memberships for the second half of the year and beyond. He also expects many movies to forgo the theaters altogether in favor of online releases. Some theaters have started offering ticket packages that include snacks and vouchers, hoping to bring in business, according to domestic media. Many provincial-level regions including Beijing, Guangdong, and Sichuan have also introduced policies to help movie theaters stay afloat. In early March, the Shanghai Film Group Corporation announced it would provide financial assistance to theaters in the Yangtze River Delta region — a major contributor to the domestic box office, with around 2,500 total theaters — in a bid to limit losses.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005377
China’s Positive Test Results in ‘Recovered’ COVID-19 Patients Explained,"Experts say that although the reason for recurring positives remains unknown, current evidence suggests there’s no need to worry about the risk of reinfection.",2020-03-25,"Months into the battle against COVID-19, scientists are still struggling to understand the new virus that has sickened over 422,000 people worldwide as of Wednesday morning. In particular, numerous reports of recovered patients testing positive for the virus again have raised more questions about how this pathogen behaves, and who is at risk. In early March, a patient in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where COVID-19 was first detected, died of the virus five days after he was deemed recovered and discharged from the hospital. Meanwhile, 5-10% of discharged COVID-19 patients in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, tested positive in later checkups, according to preliminary data from several quarantine facilities. Other provinces including Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hainan, and Guangdong have reported similar cases of reinfection. Health authorities in southern China’s Guangdong province said in late February that 14% of recovered patients evaluated tested positive again after being discharged. Around the world, recovered patients in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan have also tested positive again days to weeks after being discharged. It remains unclear why patients would test positive again, but experts say inaccurate tests could lead to patients being discharged before fully recovering. Who is greenlighted to leave the hospital? According to the COVID-19 treatment guidelines set by China’s national health authority, patients can be discharged from the hospital if they have two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, as well as improvements in clinical symptoms such as fever and cough. However, many factors may affect the accuracy of a test, such as the reliability of its manufacturer and how, where, and when the sample is collected. “We don’t even know whether this (nucleic acid) test is the best way to detect infections,” Shen Yinzhong, an infectious disease expert at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, tells Sixth Tone. “All laboratory tests have limitations, so we (as doctors) wouldn’t rely solely on test results when making a diagnosis. Instead, we consider patients’ medical histories and clinical symptoms in addition to those tests for a comprehensive evaluation.” Experts further say that a negative test does not necessarily mean the patient is virus-free, nor does a positive test mean the patient is still sick. “The RT-PCR test (nucleic acid test) is not a test of cure,” Philip Tierno Jr., a pathologist at New York University, tells Sixth Tone. “It will be positive to any of the viral RNA remnant that remains at the site, even though that viral matter is dead.” Are people who test positive after recovering still infectious? To date, there are no known cases of discharged patients infecting others, but it’s too early to say categorically that they aren’t contagious. “It could be that there’s no live virus, or it could be that they were no longer infectious,” Shen says. “It’s also possible that these patients followed our suggestions to rest at home and thus did not spread the virus.” China’s health authority has recommended that all COVID-19 patients quarantine themselves at home for an additional two weeks after being discharged. Can a fully recovered person be reinfected? Although there is no evidence to date that might completely rule out this possibility, experts suggest reinfection is unlikely, especially over the short term after recovery. The human body can develop long-lasting immunity against some pathogens like the chickenpox virus, but immunity against other viruses can be short-lived, lasting only a few months. “From the preliminary data, our immunity against the coronavirus is likely to be short-term,” Shen says. “But for how short, we don’t know.” Shen added that in theory, a patient could also become reinfected if the immunity they develop is too weak to offer full protection. But as the outbreak subsides in China, the infection risk for healthy people who don’t have immunity against the virus is relatively low. Therefore, it’s unlikely that patients who are discharged after appearing healthy will contract the virus again, Shen says. Could antibody tests be a better discharge criterion? Following reports of positive tests among cleared patients, some hospitals and quarantine sites in China have adopted antibody tests as an additional discharge requirement. These tests detect specific defenses generated by the immune system when staving off infection. A hospital staff member told The Paper, Sixth Tone’s sister publication, that the additional test is intended to “ensure 100% recovery of the patients.” But Shen says the antibody test may not be absolutely necessary, although it could be used to supplement other evidence. “Individuals produce antibodies at different rates,” he says, adding that he considers patients’ symptoms and general feelings to be more important criteria. “We are still in the early stages of understanding the virus, but that’s OK,” Shen says. “There is no need to panic. When we find a problem, we look for a solution scientifically, calmly, and rationally.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005374
Doubts and Decoctions: TCM on the Coronavirus Front Line,Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners say an ancient remedy has proven highly effective as a treatment for COVID-19-induced pneumonia. But some patients remain wary.,2020-03-24,"Since being sent to the front lines of China’s battle against COVID-19, Dr. Yan Fang has handled many difficult cases. But the loss of one patient in particular still fills him with regret. The woman, a COVID-19 patient in her 70s, had arrived at Yan’s hospital ward in the central Chinese city of Wuhan with severe pneumonia. The doctor prescribed an herbal remedy that had proven effective in many similar cases, but the patient’s family — skeptical of the merits of traditional Chinese medicine — didn’t give her the treatment. Within days, the patient was dead, and Yan says he’s convinced that, had she taken the medicine, she would have had a better chance of survival. “Until her death, her son never gave her a single drop of the traditional medication I prescribed,” Yan told Sixth Tone. “Patients in the same ward were all recovering with a combination of TCM and Western treatments. I can’t describe how depressed I was at that moment.”  Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have faced numerous challenges of the like in recent weeks after authorities handed TCM a central role in the country’s efforts to combat the coronavirus. As the number of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei skyrocketed through January and February, 4,900 TCM specialists were dispatched to hospitals in the region, and over 74,000 Chinese COVID-19 patients have received some form of TCM treatment, according to government estimates. But physicians have sometimes struggled to convince patients to place their faith in non-Western treatments, despite their insistence that certain traditional remedies are effective against a coronavirus-induced pneumonia. China included TCM treatments in its national diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 as early as late January. The sixth version of the guidelines, released Feb. 18, detailed which TCM formulas should be used to treat different symptoms of the disease. According to TCM experts, one popular traditional medicine — an herbal formula named “lung-cleansing and detoxifying decoction” — appears to be particularly useful as an anti-COVID-19 treatment. The decoction, a concentrated liquid prepared by boiling ingredients including orange peel, cassia twig, and Chinese licorice for several hours, is said to alleviate pneumonia symptoms.  Tong Xiaolin, a leading researcher at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, said his team recently concluded a study of the decoction’s effectiveness on COVID-19 patients in 10 Chinese provinces. “As of March 13, 1,102 of the 1,261 COVID-19 patients … who used the decoction had recovered,” Tong told Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper. “Another 71 said their condition had improved.” Smaller-scale comparison studies testing the formula’s efficacy have also taken place in Beijing and Wuhan in recent weeks. Zhang Boli, president of the Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the study of 102 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan found clear evidence that patients treated with both the decoction and Western medication recovered more quickly than those taking Western medicine alone. “It took 1.5 days on average for the fevers of those taking TCM to dissipate, but three days for those who didn’t (take the decoction),” Zhang told reporters in a press briefing March 13. The Beijing-based study, meanwhile, found the decoction helped patients’ lung conditions improve within eight days on average, rather than just over 10 days for those treated exclusively with Western drugs.  A large section of the Chinese public, however, doubts the usefulness of TCM, especially when used to treat acute conditions. While two-thirds of respondents to a 2015 survey by China Youth Daily agreed that TCM therapies produce few side effects and can help regulate one’s health, only 23% said they’d choose to be treated using TCM if they came down with a common disease. Nearly 46% of respondents, by contrast, said they’d prefer to be treated with Western medicine. Yan, the TCM doctor, says he was taken aback by the resistance he encountered when he was sent to work at Wuhan Hankou Hospital in early February. Before his arrival, the hospital’s 300 COVID-19 inpatients were all being treated using Western medicine, and many of them didn’t want the TCM practitioner’s help. Though traditional medicine is widely used in Yan’s home province of Guangdong, where he has practiced for 20 years, this is not the case in Hubei.  “The first day we arrived at the hospital, we realized many Wuhanese don’t trust TCM,” said Yan. “We were rejected by some patients, especially young men.” In the case Yan singled out as the most frustrating, the 70-something patient was accompanied by her son, a man in his 30s. (At the time, patients’ loved ones were still allowed to stay with them in the hospital.) The man had appeared to agree with Yan’s course of treatment, and it was only later the doctor found out he hadn’t given his mother any of the decoction he’d prescribed. “This was the only case (like this),” said Yan. “We were heartbroken by her loss, because she could have survived with our help.” Over time, however, Yan says many of his patients have changed their attitudes toward TCM. Of the 200 COVID-19 patients still hospitalized in Hankou, 150 are taking the lung-cleansing decoction, he told Sixth Tone March 14. “Very few patients agreed to take TCM in the early days,” says Yan. “The first batch of herbal ingredients arrived at the hospital from (the southwestern province of) Sichuan on Feb. 12. After just one day, five patients who’d taken the decoction told us they’d felt improvements — better sleep and bowel movements … Honestly, we didn’t expect they’d improve so quickly.”  Tian Lihua is among the TCM converts. The 63-year-old Wuhan resident had rarely used traditional medicine before being hospitalized with COVID-19 on Feb. 4, and she initially rejected all non-Western medication, telling her doctors she was too weak to heat up the decoction. “As I understood it then, TCM might help address non-urgent chronic conditions, but not acute infectious diseases like COVID-19,” said Tian. Tian relented after two weeks at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, during which her condition continued to deteriorate. “She was breathing with difficulty even when lying in bed,” recalled Liu Cao, a TCM doctor who was dispatched to the hospital from his home province of Sichuan in late January. Liu eventually convinced Tian to accept his help Feb. 19. In addition to the decoction, the doctor gave her a therapeutic massage to ease her breathing. “I was amazed by the effects from the massage — my breathing became much easier right afterward and my sleep that night also improved,” said Tian. “My condition is much better than a month ago, when I felt like I was dying … But I can’t tell which has helped me more — Western medicine or TCM — because I’ve been using both.”  Of the three other people on Tian’s ward that received TCM treatment, two recovered and were discharged in mid-March, said Liu. The remaining COVID-19 patients at the Red Cross Hospital — including Tian — have been transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital, a temporary facility built in response to the pandemic. Huoshenshan doesn’t have TCM doctors staffed, and Tian has been lobbying the hospital to provide her with traditional therapies. Her recovery has stalled since she was moved March 14, she said. “I feel like my legs have weakened,” said Tian. “I can’t catch my breath after getting out of bed and walking a few steps.” Because most viral infections are self-limiting, Yan stressed it’s hard to prove to what extent TCM has been responsible for patients’ recoveries in Wuhan. “But overemphasizing the self-limiting nature of the virus might result in a higher mortality rate,” warned the doctor. “Intervention measures are important, as you can’t guarantee everyone’s immune system can combat the virus.”  The experience on the pandemic front lines has given Yan renewed confidence in TCM’s future, though he admitted some young patients at Hankou were still refusing his help in mid-March, when his assignment at the hospital came to an end. “There’s a long way to go before TCM can win wider recognition at home and abroad,” said Yan. “We can prove we’re not only effective, but also fast.” There are signs some health professionals overseas are taking an interest in TCM therapies as the pandemic worsens, though this is currently small-scale. The coronavirus had infected nearly 300,000 and killed over 13,000 outside China as of Monday.  In the March 13 press briefing, Zhang of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine said he had recently been in touch with a health association in Switzerland interested in how to incorporate TCM into COVID-19 treatment plans, while some TCM therapies had been sent to the United States. “But the quantity of TCM drugs sent was small, and these were just some individual clinics,” Zhang added. “In Japan and Thailand, authorities are also paying close attention to our experience in applying TCM.” Yan said he was unsure how effective TCM would be when used in different geographies and on patients of differing ethnic backgrounds. “But in China, patients from across the country have had many similarities,” he said. “I’m confident enough to say the participation of TCM in the fight against COVID-19 in any country will only help ease the situation.” According to Liu, TCM is only truly effective when patients believe it can help them. That’s why his team has invested significant effort into convincing patients in Wuhan to accept their methods, he said. “We can’t force people to use our therapies,” Liu told Sixth Tone. “The theory of qi (vital energy) is very important in TCM. Only if a patient trusts TCM, will their qi be smooth enough to accept the herbal essence into their bodies.” Yan, however, is convinced TCM has enhanced its reputation in China over the past two months. “TCM appeared much earlier in this fight against COVID-19 compared with the previous one against SARS in 2003, and many more TCM professionals have engaged in it,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005368
Wuhan Grapples With ‘Silent Carriers’ Absent From Official Data,"As doctors and nurses head home from the province at the center of China’s coronavirus outbreak, disease control officials are being asked to stick around to help with a final — and potentially formidable — challenge.",2020-03-23,"Update: In response to concerns about silent carriers of the COVID-19 virus, Wuhan health authorities said Monday night that all asymptomatic cases are quarantined for 14 days and given further tests. “A few silent carriers will develop into confirmed patients, but most can recover on their own,” the authority said. The statement added that while silent carriers can be infectious, the World Health Organization has suggested that, based on the existing data, most people who contract the virus get it from COVID-19 patients with symptoms. Less than a week after medical teams from all over China began heading home from the central Hubei province, where COVID-19 is most concentrated, some disease control officials are being asked to stay and help resolve the lingering threat of “silent carriers,” according to domestic news outlet Caixin. As of Sunday, Hubei had reported no newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 for four days straight, after 67,800 people in the province became infected and over 3,000 died. By Friday, some 12,000 medical workers dispatched to Hubei to assist with treatment and containment efforts had left the province. However, a source from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Caixin that Hubei’s epidemic control headquarters had requested that a team of officials from disease control and prevention centers across the country remain for the time being, citing “worries over the conditions in Wuhan (Hubei’s provincial capital) and Hubei.” Among these worries are the so-called silent carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. “Every day, a couple to over 10 cases of covert infections of the virus are being detected,” Caixin’s report, published Monday, quoted the China CDC staff member as saying. “It’s hard to judge now whether the spread of the virus in Wuhan has been thoroughly cut off.” A silent carrier — a term referring to a person who has been infected with the COVID-19 virus but does not show symptoms — is different from a “confirmed patient” or “suspected patient” under China’s national guidelines for diagnosing and treating the disease. The fifth version of the guideline, issued Feb. 4, stated for the first time that silent carriers could potentially infect others. An article published Friday by the scientific journal Nature underscored experts’ concerns about covert coronavirus infections. “Many scientists have suspected that there is an undetected pool of covert cases showing limited to no symptoms because an increasing number of infected people cannot be linked to known COVID-19 cases or travel to epidemic hotspots,” the article said. Over the weekend, the Wuhan government tried to assuage the public’s fears by clarifying the difference between “silent carriers” and “confirmed cases,” after a photo of a notice warning households in a Wuhan residential compound of a newly confirmed case among them was widely circulated online. The case — an apparent contradiction of the city’s official data, which claimed there had been no new infections that day — sparked an online outcry. According to the state-owned Xinhua News Agency, the new case — a patient surnamed Zhang who had a body normal temperature and showed none of the usual symptoms — tested positive for the coronavirus. “According to our investigation, the resident Zhang is a silent carrier,” the Wuhan government said in a statement Sunday morning. “(Zhang) is not a confirmed case,” it added, citing the national guideline. Despite not being counted among confirmed cases, silent carriers of the coronavirus must be treated or quarantined. “There are different quarantine sites for such people, including hospitals,” Yan Fang, a doctor from the southern Guangdong province who was sent to Wuhan’s Hankou Hospital to treat severe COVID-19 patients, told Sixth Tone. “They’re given anti-viral treatments similar to the therapies offered to patients with mild symptoms,” another doctor, Liu Cao, who traveled to Wuhan from the southwestern Sichuan province and worked in the local Red Cross hospital, told Sixth Tone. “We have received such carriers transferred from shelter hospitals — they were detected after their close family members were diagnosed.” A local resident from the housing compound where Zhang lives told Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity that the complex has been completely sealed-off from the surrounding city. “The gate of the compound has remained closed. We continue to purchase our daily necessities online, and they’re delivered inside the neighborhood,” said the Wuhan native, who runs a small business. “After the incident (of the silent carrier), we stopped getting updates about infections within the neighborhood,” the resident said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005367
"Post-Coronavirus, China Must Come to the Aid of Its Domestic Workers","Domestic helpers perform valuable, underappreciated services in our society. Now that they’ve been economically devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s our turn to help them.",2020-03-23,"On Jan. 23, two days before the Lunar New Year, China locked down almost the entire province of Hubei. The goal was to keep that centrally located region’s novel coronavirus outbreak from riding the wave of the country’s annual pre-holiday travel rush, but by that point, millions of residents had already left. Soon, lockdowns of varying degrees were being imposed nationwide, as provincial authorities, especially those in areas with highly mobile populations, restricted traffic, prohibited large gatherings, shuttered workplaces, and imposed partial or complete quarantines on suspected or potential carriers. Although they were largely successful in finally limiting the disease’s spread, these “hardcore” preventative measures have put serious strain on certain industries — especially those reliant on migrants, like domestic work. Experts estimate there are approximately 35 million domestic workers in China. Together they provide cleaning, cooking, and childrearing services to tens of millions of households throughout the country, as well as look after pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals who are frail or who have a disability. Due to the tenuous nature of their work, however, they are among the most vulnerable to the economic and psychological aftershocks of the pandemic. Outbreak-linked restrictions on road traffic and interpersonal communication have and will continue to prevent domestic workers from finding and holding down jobs, while the ensuing economic uncertainty may impact urban households’ ability to hire domestic help or offer them reasonable wages. According to a 2017 study, only about 10% of China’s domestic workers are formal employees with legitimate labor contracts. The vast majority are contractors, hired through outlets like middlemen companies. They are not covered by the country’s labor laws, and so the pandemic has exposed the precarity of their employment. Although it varies by region, based on interviews with companies, middlemen, and support organizations around the country, it seems that new contracts have declined by 85% compared with the same period last year. One manager of a middleman organization based in southern megacity Guangzhou said salaries had also fallen. Complicating matters, almost all domestic workers in China are women, the majority of whom are older and from rural areas with low education levels. Outside of their hometowns, this group lacks the social resources and support networks that would help them protect their rights and interests. In order to better understand the impact of the pandemic on domestic workers, in early February the Beijing Hongyan Social Work Service Center carried out a limited online survey of Beijing-based domestic workers. We received 90 responses, all of them from women. The results confirmed our concerns: The pandemic has left domestic workers under tremendous professional, financial, and psychological strain. Beijing’s domestic workers hail from all over the country, forming part of what experts refer to as the country’s “floating population” of migrant workers. According to our survey, roughly two-thirds of respondents returned home for the holiday. The government’s strict preventative measures — such as quarantines, roadblocks, and the complete closure of many villages — forced almost three-quarters of this group to postpone their return to Beijing. For the third who never left — or who eventually made it back to the city — mandatory or voluntary quarantine periods and a lack of basic protective supplies such as masks have made it hard to get around and do their jobs. Roadblocks and reduced public transit are making daily commutes longer and more expensive, and if their employer’s residential community is quarantined, domestic workers can face problems reaching their place of employment. As a result, many domestic workers have experienced severe difficulties looking for and keeping jobs. More than half of the domestic workers active on the job market reported that finding work has become extremely difficult. Those who had lined up work for after the holiday, only to find themselves trapped in their hometowns indefinitely, are now worried about losing their positions. Adding insult to injury, various communities in Beijing have tightened restrictions on migrant populations, including blocking them from returning to their rental apartments. This has left members of the city’s floating population no choice but to find — and pay for — temporary accommodations wherever they can. These additional expenses, coupled with rising commuting costs, have further increased the financial strain on domestic workers. Psychologically, the pandemic is pushing many domestic workers to the brink. Among respondents, nearly 90% expressed concerns about the impact of the pandemic, and close to 60% of those described themselves “extremely worried.” Virtually all respondents said they wanted additional help. Their most commonly cited need was for more protective materials like masks, which they require to do their jobs. Roughly 34% requested help identifying job opportunities, and 32% said they needed financial assistance. A quarter of the domestic workers surveyed said they could use help finding or paying for housing. The anxiety of domestic workers who stayed in Beijing over the holiday has also been exacerbated by employers’ increasingly stringent demands regarding hygiene, which require them to spend more time cleaning each day. Of this group, approximately 40% said their employers had started demanding more from them. A number complained they were working longer hours, or that their bosses wouldn’t let them leave the house, even just to go outside, out of fear of contagion. The needs of domestic workers will likely continue to evolve as the pandemic runs its course. China is gradually relaxing its prevention policies, allowing migrant domestic workers to return to cities and resume work, but many will have no income during their imposed quarantine periods. Officials and nongovernmental organizations must lend a hand in reducing the strain on domestic workers by helping them identify job opportunities and manage agency fees and other costs. Over the past two months, the Hongyan center has set up a hotline for domestic workers, helped them find new work opportunities — at one point even assisting a woman in resolving a wage dispute. We also provide an online platform for domestic workers to share their problems, both as a way for them to let off steam and find solutions to their problems, and as a means of documenting this chapter of history. However, as a charitable organization, we’re all too aware of our funding and resource limitations. In light of this, last month we issued an open letter calling on domestic companies and employers to provide shelters and wages throughout the quarantine period. We hope businesses and other social actors will do their part to improve the living conditions of domestic workers — one of China’s most valuable and vulnerable groups.

A Visual Diary From the Heart of the Pandemic,Photographer and Wuhan native Zhang Xizhi recorded his life under lockdown.,2020-03-23,"HUBEI, Central China — In our little family of three, we are all Wuhanese, born and raised. Though we have not been infected during the COVID-19 pandemic, our two-month imprisonment in our home has been a roller coaster of emotions.  I received the news of Wuhan’s complete shutdown in the early morning of Jan. 23, two days before the Lunar New Year. Initially it didn’t shock me, because I had been following the news of a mysterious new type of pneumonia since the end of last year. However, when I saw a video of subway stations shutting their gates in the middle of the day, I was dumbfounded.  Early Days of the Shutdown  Our family’s groceries list suddenly expanded from food to celebrate the New Year to supplies to survive the city’s shutdown. My father felt uneasy about letting me go out and insisted on doing it himself. All I could do was urge him to wear a mask, hat, and gloves, and to keep away from crowds.   When my father returned from the store, he said our residential compound was completely empty; the small gaggle of elderly people who could usually be found exercising in the courtyard had disappeared without a trace. The groceries had cost 50% more than usual. At the pharmacy, masks, rubbing alcohol, and other protective supplies were already sold out.  On the second day of the shutdown, I decided to drive around the city — before an announced ban on private vehicles went into effect — just to see how drastically Wuhan had changed in the last 24 hours. My father volunteered to drive so it would be easier for me to focus on taking photos. My mother declared us both to be out of our minds.  When we reached the city center, we saw that once-bustling streets had emptied overnight, almost like Wuhan had suddenly gone to sleep. The usual crowds at landmarks like Tortoise Mountain TV Tower, Yellow Crane Tower, and Jiefang Avenue had disappeared. I wanted to use my lens to immortalize this unusual transformation. The people standing and staring from the overpass epitomized our sense of hopelessness and confusion at the beginning of this outbreak. The hawkers and homeless people who were still on the sidewalk even though all the stores were shuttered — what were they going to do? How were they going to survive?   A Nontraditional Spring Festival  On Jan. 24, Lunar New Year’s Eve, my mother woke up at her usual early hour and saw in our family group chat that the airline where my cousin works had just suspended all flights. She replied with a feigned sense of calm: “Hon, this could be a good chance for you to take some needed time off.”  My father has smoked for years, suffers from chronic bronchitis, and is always coughing. When the news of the citywide shutdown broke, my mother teased him: “If you even so much as think of leaving, they’ll arrest you on the spot.” As she tried to make light of the situation, I could sense how frightened she really was on the inside. She’s almost 60 years old and has battled lung cancer for more than five years. The novel coronavirus is as much of a threat to her as it is to my dad. She said the shutdown was the biggest event she had ever witnessed in her life.   The extended family’s traditional reunion dinner was also cancelled due to the outbreak; instead, the three of us stayed in for the New Year. For New Year’s dinner this year, my father made Huangpi Sanxian, a Wuhanese dish with fishballs, meatballs, and a type of meatloaf. Our family sat at the table in front of this dish, which carried auspicious and joyful connotations, and wished each other a happy Year of the Rat.  With his persistent smoker’s cough and regular trips outside, my father was constantly afraid he’d been infected. After the New Year dinner, he returned to his room, leaving my mother to watch the Spring Festival Gala alone in the living room. She had been feeling down because of the outbreak, but the Gala’s “Parents’ Love” skit at least gave her some comic relief. She enjoys the atmosphere of big family gatherings: “I feel like the Gala was still able to comfort us Wuhanese, alleviating our feelings of being wounded, abandoned, and misunderstood.”  Not once did we consider leaving. As my mom said: “Fleeing is not a wise choice. The only thing we can do to protect ourselves and others is to shut ourselves indoors.”   Darkest Hour  From the 25th to the 27th, we received a stream of bad news as the number of confirmed cases continued to skyrocket. My cousin told us her classmate’s cousin had just died in the hospital; all my mother could reply at first was “That’s terrifying.” After almost an hour of silence, she sent another message: “Out of the whole family, I’m the most at risk with my background of lung disease. If I get it, I’m a goner,” followed by two crying emojis.  My mother had a bad toothache about a week into the shutdown, so I went out to buy medicine for her. The only open pharmacy in the vicinity of our small residential compound had a table set up out front where I gave my order to the clerk, who then went inside to retrieve what I needed. They carried the medicine out and placed it on the small table in front of me so that at no point during the transaction would we make any physical contact. Upon returning home, I found my mother sobbing to herself in her room. She had just learned that one of her relatives had contracted the virus, and she was calling all of her contacts for help. I was heartbroken to hear my mother’s cries of panic and despair as she spoke on the phone.  Because my father is a public servant who needed to leave the house to carry out epidemic prevention and control work in the community, we relied on him to buy our essentials. However, my seriously ill mother could no longer obtain her medications for cancer and rheumatism because of the shutdown, so her only choice was to decrease the amount of medication she took on a daily basis.  I have lived in Wuhan for 29 years. For me, this city is full of friends, relatives, and acquaintances. But all of a sudden, I had to relinquish some of these ties forever. The streets outside my window were utterly silent, save for the rumble of a single truck spraying disinfectant. This may well have been Wuhan’s darkest hour.   Numb  After Feb. 2, the city of Wuhan gradually ramped up its preventative measures. First, the expressway out of the city was blocked; then the inner city’s main thoroughfares; and now, even the gate to our residential community is barred shut. In this prison-like existence, I’ve gradually lost all sense of time. Forbidden from leaving the house, all I seem to do these days is sleep and eat, and yet I’ve lost 3 kilograms — my mother says it’s because of “worrying for the country and the people.” When I asked her how she was coping so far, she told me she felt numb: “I don’t know when all this will come to an end. I just want to go downstairs and walk around, but I’m afraid of being infected. Being cramped up like this for so long is driving me crazy.” However, when she stepped out of the house for the first time since the outbreak on the afternoon of March 14, my mom was seized by panic the moment she saw other people walking toward her on the street, especially those wearing hazmat suits.  At times, I haven’t been able to resist venting to my friends outside Wuhan, who invariably try to comfort me by saying: “Isn’t everything getting better?” Yes, it is getting better, but I can’t ignore the wails of those who are still in trouble.  Poet Feng Zhi wrote in 1948:  Human suffering is like a tree that stands upright in winter, swaying in the wind and snow, with nowhere to hide. Only sin shows off in a beautiful coat — frauds hide their hypocrisy through empty slogans, while a true survivor faces the truth head-on. Even if his words are as unpleasant to hear as a cough in the middle of the night, they move and enlighten the people who hear them, because they represent the sound of survival.  It is this sound of survival that reminds us that everyone who has died is tied to us. The pandemic will pass, the city will recover, but the dead will not come back. What we need to do is not forget — we must erect monuments to them in our hearts.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005363
"Dispatches From Hubei: Out of Sight, a Blind Massage Parlor Quietly Struggles","On Jan. 18, Zhang Lei paid 50,000 yuan to take over a massage parlor in Wuhan. Five days later, the city went into lockdown.",2020-03-22,"I was sitting alone in my shop in the central city of Wuhan one day in late January when I suddenly heard a voice blare out from the darkness: “The city is now under lockdown!” I had no idea what it meant. I didn’t lose my sight until I was 4 years old, but as far as I’m concerned, I’ve always been living in the dark. When someone says something is red or blue, I don’t know what they mean: Colors are just words to me. I’ve completely forgotten what they look like. I left my hometown, a small city about 150 kilometers from Wuhan, 10 years ago to study massage therapy at a school run by the provincial Disabled Persons’ Federation. Now 36, I’ve spent the past decade working in massage parlors around the country. On Jan. 18, however, I paid 50,000 yuan ($7,300) to take over a parlor of my own in Wuhan. Over 80 square meters in size, it has seven massage beds and four pedicure chairs. The rent is 5,200 yuan per month. Although it’s a little run-down — running my fingers over the wallpaper, I can tell it’s peeling — I was really happy. I finally had my own business. I could start making money, I remember thinking, and maybe even find a girlfriend, too. Five days later, the city was put under quarantine.  In the Dark There weren’t many customers in the two days my massage parlor was open for business. On Jan. 20, my workers went home for the Lunar New Year, and because I couldn’t take care of the place on my own, I closed up shop. I planned to reopen on Feb. 1 — shortly after the holiday was originally set to end. When I first heard about the lockdown, on Jan. 23, I figured it would probably last half a month at most, so I didn’t pay it much heed. A friend told me to get face masks as soon as possible. When I replied that I had disposable massage masks, he told me those wouldn’t cut it. I should buy surgical masks, he said. I remained skeptical. How serious could things be? Eventually, I left the compound and tried a couple of drugstores nearby. In the third one I visited, the shop assistant said they had two packs of masks, but he could only sell me one. I was surprised, but I bought it without saying anything. The next day, a friend who works in the hard-hit area of Hankou told me he’d seen a man walking along the street suddenly drop to the ground and not get up. I got really scared when I heard that. Only then did I realize this was really a serious disease. From then on, I didn’t dare step outside. I spent every day inside the massage parlor, on my own, with the door firmly locked. The outbreak caught me off guard. I didn’t know what to do or what was going on outside. At first, I called the mayor’s hotline, but they told me to contact the Disabled Persons’ Federation. I called them repeatedly, but no one picked up. Finally, I tried calling the local community office. They said I should stay indoors and that I could buy food through them. Most of the good stuff had been snatched up early, but I paid 58 yuan for a vegetable medley package. It had cabbage, peppers, and tomatoes, among other things, though they weren’t particularly fresh. In the past, when I’d worked for others, the other employees and I used to live together as a group, so this was the first time I’d lived on my own. Early on, the delivery drivers would call to say that the compound’s gate was sealed off because of the lockdown, and they weren’t allowed in. I had to ask them to tell the community worker manning the gate that I can’t see and to let the driver bring the groceries to my door. On Feb. 28, 37 days after the lockdown began, I was cooking lunch at home when I heard a “puff” from the direction of my electric hot plate. I was scared to death: I thought it might be a spark. I found the hot plate had short-circuited, and the circuit breaker for my home had tripped too. I didn’t know what to do, so I called the community office. The staff there said that the electrician wasn’t at work and told me to try calling the next day. I was alone in the shop, unable to see or fix anything. I couldn’t cook rice or vegetables, but I knew I couldn’t just not eat. There was nothing to do but call a friend, who helped me post a message asking for help online. Soon, I was receiving phone calls with offers of help from all over the country. At 11 p.m., two volunteers arrived. They helped me get the electricity back on and even brought me some noodles. Two days later, the metal grate protecting my shop suddenly stopped working. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with the volunteers again. They brought me a new electric hot plate, a bag of rice, some vegetables, and helped me close the shutters. I really appreciate what they did for me. I’ve decided that after the pandemic is over, I’m going to give them free massages. I’m starting to lose track of time, however, and I don’t know how much longer that will be. I’m often too anxious to sleep, so at night, I take out my cellphone and listen to the news, massage tutorials, or martial arts novels. When I’m in a good mood, I sing. Frequently, I can’t get to sleep until 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning.  Investing in the Future When I was 4 years old, I caught the measles and developed a high fever. I was taken to the hospital and was given penicillin shots, but I didn’t get better. My parents told me my mother had used a folk remedy made with rat tails, which had caused my eyeballs to bulge out. They only went back in after I was given medicine and received injections. Afterward, however, I couldn’t see anything at all. At the time, the cost to cure a single eye at the hospital was between 50,000 and 60,000 yuan. Our family didn’t have that much money, so my parents stopped taking me after a few visits. Growing up, both my parents were busy working, and my two elder sisters had school, so I was brought up in the mountains by my maternal grandparents. I had a lonely childhood: I didn’t have any friends and I never went to school. When my parents retired, I decided I wanted to be independent. Choosing to leave my hometown 10 years ago was big for me. At first, my parents didn’t approve, but they couldn’t talk me out of it. I wanted to venture out into the world and learn more. I came alone to Wuhan and began studying massage therapy. There aren’t any other choices for blind people. I’m 36 years old. Over the past 10 years, I’ve earned 2,000 to 3,000 yuan a month — less than half the Wuhan average in 2018 — though my food and rent were covered by my employers. I broke up with my then-girlfriend five years ago and have been single ever since. Working in a massage parlor doesn’t pay well, so it’s hard to find a match. I’m also getting older now, so I made the decision that I couldn’t just keep on working for other people. That’s why I wanted to open my own massage parlor. Last summer, a friend told me that his boss was looking to sell his massage business. I’d been there before and spoken with the boss. I thought the business seemed good — the only sticking point being that the decor was a little past its prime. So, on Jan. 18, after raising 50,000 yuan, I took it over. I used to think that by saving up money and buying this place, my life would change for the better. I never expected this.  Living Costs I’m in a group chat for visually impaired massage professionals in Wuhan. Before the city was put under lockdown, most of the 200 members had already returned to their hometowns. I’d chosen to stay: I had just taken over the massage parlor and my parents would bug me about getting married if I went home. I really regret my decision, but who could have predicted what would happen? I wash my hands at least once every 10 minutes throughout the day. I also mop the floor with disinfectant three to five times a day and drink three to five bottles of boiled water. Before going to bed, I bathe and soak my feet in white vinegar for half an hour, which softens the blood vessels and kills bacteria. The day the city went into lockdown, my parents called and told me to stay indoors. I always wear a mask when I take out the trash or go to collect things, so I’m not too concerned about myself. But my parents are old. Even though their hometown hasn’t been as seriously affected as Wuhan, I still worry about them. I call them every day and remind them to stay indoors, wash their hands, and drink lots of water. The price of vegetables and meat is much higher than usual. Because I can’t open the parlor, I don’t have any money coming in. I don’t dare buy meat. On Lunar New Year’s Eve, I spent a dozen yuan to buy some fish balls and meatballs. I cooked and ate them alone in the shop to celebrate. But I’ve been as vegetarian as a Buddhist monk ever since. I currently only have a few dozen yuan left and can only wait for my mom to transfer me a little money to get by. I only just bought this parlor and I already don’t know if I can hold onto it. I don’t have any savings left and still have to pay rent and utilities. To be honest, I’ve considered selling it. But I can’t bear to give it up. After all, it’s taken so much work to finally get my very own parlor. I don’t want to go back to working for other people. I want to keep going, even if that means moving to a place where I can make a bit more money for a while, like Shanghai or the eastern city of Suzhou. If I can earn enough to pay the bills, then I can keep holding on to this place. A while back, I asked the landlord if I could get a month’s free rent, but he never replied.

"As China’s Economic Slowdown Bites, Workers Are Feeling the Pain",Employers are cutting staff and slashing salaries and benefits amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And workers locked down in Hubei province are the most vulnerable.,2020-03-21,"When Cheng Wei returned to Central China in early January, he thought he’d only be staying a few weeks. The 29-year-old would marry his fiancée in his ancestral hometown later that month, before going back to work in southern tech hub Shenzhen. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has torn the young technician’s plans to shreds. Over two months later, he’s still stuck in the central Hubei province, which remains partly under lockdown after suffering over 60,000 infections and 3,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus. And Cheng is paying a heavy price for his enforced absence from work. On Feb. 28, Cheng’s employer, display panel manufacturer China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), informed staff at its Shenzhen plant that they would have to make up for any lost workdays by working unpaid overtime or taking personal leave.  For CSOT’s roughly 200 Hubei-based employees, it’s a bitter pill to swallow. Many have already missed over 30 workdays, meaning they’ll need to work hundreds of unpaid hours or accept a salary deduction of over 6,000 yuan ($850). Like many Chinese migrants, Cheng normally works extra-long shifts and weekends to supplement his income. If he isn’t paid for this overtime, he estimates his monthly wages will drop from around 6,000 yuan to just 2,700 yuan. “This rule is inhumane,” said Cheng, who insisted on using a pseudonym due to the sensitivity of the issue. “Once you’ve deducted social security payments, I’d have at least half a year on only 2,000 yuan (per month). It’s hard to live on that.”  Chinese authorities have taken multiple steps to protect workers during the pandemic, asking employers to avoid layoffs and introducing regulations requiring companies to grant short-term paid leave and refrain from unilateral wage cuts. But some firms are circumventing or simply ignoring such policies amid a sharp economic slowdown triggered by the pandemic, with some analysts predicting China’s gross domestic product will contract by 9% in the first quarter. China’s official unemployment rate rose to 6.2% in February, indicating that roughly 5 million people lost their jobs that month. In a recent survey by Fujinfu, a financial subsidiary of manufacturing giant Foxconn, half of blue-collar workers said their income could decline by up to 50% compared with before the pandemic. Fang Yan, a lawyer based in the northwestern Shaanxi province and a National People’s Congress representative, told domestic media in early February that the pandemic may cause a large number of legal disputes. In a written message to Sixth Tone in March, Fang said she had indeed seen a large number of labor disputes since the pandemic began, especially cases related to wages and work-related injuries. She added that people from Hubei province are among the most vulnerable to mistreatment, as they’ve been highly impacted by quarantine and virus-prevention measures.  “Many Hubei employees are unable to return to work due to virus control (policies),” said Fang. “However, one-sided dismissals or salary reductions due to late work resumption are currently rare.” The economic turbulence is giving companies incentives to pass on the costs of the slowdown to workers, said Yang Bohua, a lawyer with the South China-based Guangdong Guolong Law Firm. “We think manufacturing businesses are more prone to disputes as they hire many people,” said Yang. “To survive, some companies may play tricks, which incur labor conflicts.” And despite the government’s efforts to protect labor rights, regulations are often difficult to enforce in practice, especially in sectors like manufacturing with relatively lax supervision, Liu Jiwei, a partner at Beijing-based Weiheng Law Firm, told Sixth Tone.  Employees at CSOT are confronting this reality. According to Cheng, Hubei-based staff members at the company have made several calls to their local labor and social security bureau trying to report the issue, but the calls have gone unanswered. Some of the workers are now seeking legal advice, while others are refusing to return to Shenzhen, Cheng said. He contacted a lawyer he found through the Chinese super app Alipay, but later decided it wasn’t worth spending more time and money on a legal case. “An arm can’t wrestle down a leg,” said Cheng, referring to the apparent power imbalance in his relationship with the company. Another locked-down employee at CSOT’s Shenzhen plant surnamed Chen told Sixth Tone he felt he had no choice but to agree to the company’s new policy. “I don’t have much money, and I don’t want to wrangle,” said Chen, adding that any labor arbitration process would be time-consuming due to the large number of disputes during the pandemic. For most people stuck in Hubei, the top priority is simply getting back to work as quickly as possible. Under a hashtag on China’s Twitter-like Weibo that translates as “WhenCanHubeiGetUnlocked,” many user posts express anxiety over when they’ll be able to return to their jobs. The hashtag had been viewed over 29 million times as of March 20. Liu, a quality inspector at an artificial intelligence company in Shenzhen who has been locked down in her hometown of Xianning, Hubei province, fears that the longer she’s away from work, the more likely she’ll be fired as her company’s financial situation worsens.  “My company has been planning to lay people off,” said Liu, who declined to give her full name due to privacy concerns. “Because we’re in Hubei and haven’t been able to go back to work on-site for a long time, they (the company) will treat us more ruthlessly.” A few days ago, Liu’s colleague secretly sent her a list of employees her company was planning to fire. Her name was on it. As she still hasn’t been formally notified of the company’s decision, however, Liu believes her best method for keeping her job is to get back to Shenzhen as soon as possible. China is now taking steps to gradually open up Hubei as the number of new COVID-19 cases in the province dwindles. On Wednesday, the city of Wuhan — the heart of the initial outbreak — reported no new infections for the first time in months. On March 11, Hubei’s pandemic control command center announced cities would be classified as low, medium, or high-risk, with those deemed safer encouraged to resume work “safely and in an orderly manner.” The center also encouraged local governments to charter vehicles to ferry workers back to their workplaces in other provinces. Authorities remain cautious, however. Those wishing to leave Hubei have to complete an approval process, and some have found it impossible to meet the requirements.  According to Liu, each worker first has to provide their residential committee with an official certificate from their employer, proving the company is willing to “take in” the worker. Then, workers need to present proof that they’re healthy through a certificate or a specially developed health app. Liu says she’s almost completed these steps and plans to book a ticket on a government-arranged bus to Shenzhen. But Cheng and Chen, the CSOT employees, say they’re still not able to travel, because their company has refused to sign a “take-in” certificate. In a screen grab of a group message sent via the social app WeChat seen by Sixth Tone, a manager at CSOT tells workers that the company can’t issue “take-in” certificates, as the Shenzhen government has ordered it not to do so.  There is some evidence to suggest this is the case. In a February announcement, Bao’an District, where CSOT’s Shenzhen plant is located, said companies found to be asking workers from Hubei to return would be punished. The district has also agreed to pay companies a subsidy of 1,000 yuan for every employee stuck in Hubei. During a phone call with Sixth Tone, Chen Jing, a public relations executive at CSOT’s Shenzhen facility, said the company had acted according to Chinese laws and regulations and encouraged employees to use paid leave to make up for any lost workdays. The company is struggling to cope with ongoing disruptions to supply chains as a result of the pandemic, she said. “The industry has already gone downhill over the past two years — the survival of the enterprise should also be taken into consideration,” said Chen. Later, Chen added via WeChat message that CSOT had negotiated any changes in salary and benefits with employees. Cheng disputed the company’s account, describing the new rules as a coercive measure introduced without any form of negotiation. But he told Sixth Tone he just wanted to get on with his life. “Every day I spend at home now, I’m wasting money,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005345
"As COVID-19 Spreads Globally, China Steps Up Border Checks","Worried that imported cases will fuel a resurgence of the disease, the country is strengthening screening protocols.",2020-03-20,"China’s international travel hubs are screening arrivals from overseas and expanding mandatory quarantine policies to handle an expected influx of imported COVID-19 cases, according to a raft of official statements made this week. The stringent measures come as the country shifts its focus from identifying and treating domestic COVID-19 transmission to preventing a surge in infections from abroad. In Shanghai, local officials announced Thursday that Chinese nationals and non-Chinese arriving in the city from any of 24 “key” countries must submit to a 14-day quarantine either at home or a designated hotel — the latter at the traveler’s own expense. That’s up from 16 countries on Tuesday, with new additions Australia, Malaysia, and Greece joining pandemic hot spots South Korea, Italy, Iran, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the list. The same day, the city said it had set up 23 quarantine sites near its main international airport capable of accommodating around 12,000 individuals in total. Beijing has been requiring all arrivals from abroad to submit to a 14-day quarantine period in city-designated observation sites since Monday. After images of logjams at Beijing Capital Airport’s international arrivals terminal circulated widely online, the national government declared Thursday that some international flights from Moscow, Paris, Tokyo, and Toronto would be rerouted to smaller cities. Passengers would then be required to deplane and complete the necessary customs, immigration, and initial medical checks before the flight could continue to the capital. The city also announced it was reopening Xiaotangshan hospital — a temporary facility built in 2003 to respond to the SARS outbreak — to treat imported COVID-19 cases. As of March 20, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has sickened over 246,000 people worldwide, including 81,000 in Chinese mainland. But the number of confirmed cases of domestic transmission has fallen to record lows in recent days, and many experts and policymakers have begun to voice concern that imported cases now pose the bigger threat. On Wednesday, prominent epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan warned that the country had to “be on guard” against imported cases and do full screenings of all arrivals from hard-hit areas, so as not to miss asymptomatic cases. All 39 COVID-19 cases confirmed in China on Thursday were identified as originating abroad, according to national health authorities. “The number of confirmed cases outside China is spiking rapidly,” Wang Fenglong, an associate professor of political geography at East China Normal University, told Sixth Tone. “After getting the domestic outbreak under control, China is gradually trying to loosen restrictions and boost its economy, so the pressure (on the government) to control imported cases is high.” Arrivals from some countries have been subject to screenings for weeks. Longtime Shanghai resident Kang Naim returned to the city from Seoul in late February, just as offices and workplaces were beginning to reopen. The 28-year-old South Korean national told Sixth Tone that everyone on her flight was made to wait for an hour on the tarmac before staff in protective suits boarded and checked everyone for signs of fever. Some passengers were then taken away for further screening. “It was frightening,” Kang said. After arriving at her Shanghai residence, community workers told her to stay inside and report her body temperature via a WeChat group every day for 14 days. They also left her some disinfectant, she said. In an attempt to reassure non-Chinese nationals under quarantine, the Shanghai People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries is making visits and sending gifts to individuals quarantined in designated hotels, according to Huang Pinfang, the head of the organization’s administrative office. Not everyone is feeling the love, however. Online, some netizens had little sympathy for the wave of students returning from overseas, partly out of fear that they could bring the virus back with them. On Wednesday, Beijing’s health authority asked students studying overseas not to return “unless absolutely necessary.” Others have expressed concern that quarantining arrivals at home may result in people ignoring the rules. In one high-profile case, a woman who returned to Beijing from Australia was fired by her employer this week after being filmed breaking her two-week quarantine order to go for a run. The academic, Wang, said China’s international quarantine policies are hampered by unclear procedures. “Questions remain over management authority, information tracking, and who should bear responsibility for the cost of treatment (for foreigners),” he said, adding that the country had yet to resort to hard limits on entries from abroad. “For international arrivals who do not comply with local quarantine policies or regularly report their health information, what department has the right to make them?” Wang said. “What coercive measures can be taken? These issues are still controversial.” On Friday afternoon, Shanghai officials announced plans to implement a so-called Four Hundreds policy, aimed at ensuring 100% of all arriving passengers undergo a health screening, receive a temperature check, have their health information cards reviewed, and are included in a customs epidemiological survey. Anyone exhibiting potential COVID-19 symptoms such as fever or a cough will be taken by ambulance to a designated medical institution, officials said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005341
On ‘Herd Immunity’ and Playing Politics in a Pandemic,The British government’s initial COVID-19 response plan has come in for heavy criticism over the past week. So why did so many of China’s public intellectuals insist on defending it?,2020-03-20,"When the British government declared last Thursday that its plan for dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic leaned on mitigating the fallout from the disease, rather than going all-out to suppress it, the response from experts around the world ranged from bewilderment to horror. By the government’s own estimate, achieving “herd immunity” would potentially require about 60% of the British population to become infected with the disease. Within days, almost 300 U.K.-based academics had signed an open letter warning that the tactic would risk “many more lives than necessary.” In China, which is only just emerging from a monthslong battle to suppress the virus predicated on harsh, sometimes draconian quarantine and lockdown policies, the reaction to the U.K.’s plan was no less confused. But British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might be touched to learn that at least one group had his back: A number of prominent Chinese intellectuals went out of their way to defend his government’s strategy. On March 14, two days after the plan was unveiled, the respected financial news outlet Caixin published a column by economics professor Yu Xiaohua which explored the underlying principles of the “herd immunity” idea, while stressing that critics shouldn’t rush to judgment. The epidemic prevention models adopted by countries like the U.K., Germany, and China would necessarily be different, Yu wrote, and it was impossible to know how they would play out. Sanlian Life Week, another prominent Chinese news magazine, ran an even more supportive take the following day. “The British epidemic prevention model is not personally decided by Boris Johnson,” the magazine’s chief writer, Yuan Yue, wrote. “It is a scientific adjustment based on (experts’) current understanding of virology.” Yuan went on to suggest letting every government act in its own way, to give scientists more “control groups” to study in the future. “This,” he wrote, “is higher-level humanism.” Of course, it doesn’t take much understanding of virology to recognize the plan was a debacle, marred by poor communication, bad science, and a lack of transparency. One non-peer reviewed study by a respected research team warned that attempts to mitigate, rather than suppress, the novel coronavirus could result in 250,000 deaths in the country. Even before Caixin and Sanlian ran their pieces, the Johnson government had already begun to change course, banning mass gatherings less than 24 hours after saying such methods would be of little use. Why did so many Chinese intellectuals — the above-mentioned authors are just two among many — nevertheless defend the plan? Their stance may come as a surprise to non-Chinese, given the relative success so far of the country’s “hardcore” epidemic prevention methods and the bitter lessons gleaned from its initially sluggish response. But anyone familiar with post-reform era Chinese intellectualism can probably recognize the pattern: For many Chinese liberals, the West has been a life raft in choppy seas, and some would rather go down with the ship than admit their longtime haven is taking on water. The advent of China’s “reform and opening-up” policy in 1979 saw a reemergence of liberal thought in the country, not just among academics and activists, but professionals, journalists, and others. In theory, they are advocates of thinking objectively and critically and bear the burden of calling out the egregious fault lines in our present system. In practice, however, too many reduce “the West” to a beacon, talisman, and occasional bludgeon, using it as a model and ideological weapon in their battles with China’s authorities while exempting its flaws from their critical analyses. In this context, Britain’s “herd immunity” strategy was just another way to cast doubt on the necessity of the strict measures used by the Chinese government to combat the novel coronavirus, including province-wide lockdowns, strict household quarantines, and tight travel restrictions. Despite the apparent success of these methods, many had been fumbling for a fundamentally different, and ideally more successful, Western model that they could point to and say, “See? There’s a better way.” However valid some of their critiques may be, this time I think they’re making a mistake. In a pandemic, a government has a duty to do its utmost to prevent the largest number of people from getting sick and delay the spread of infection. That, and not politics, is the standard we have to use. Many defenders of the plan also seem to have confused the Western political theories they adore with the reality of who is now in charge of these countries. They still believe the Western political system could never go awry. But personally, I’d argue that a few leaders in today’s Western world have shown themselves to be entirely irresponsible, even evil. In fairness, Chinese liberal intellectuals are in an extremely difficult position politically. In 2017, I wrote about how they had become popular targets for online abuse. The situation has only deteriorated since then, as netizens have been swept up by a rising tide of digital nationalism. Today, the country’s liberal literati are constantly mocked for their pro-West and anti-China stances with tags like “American dogs” or “bootlickers.” Under tremendous pressure, some public-facing liberals have lost their sobriety and neutrality. Responding to extremism in kind, they have become more and more like their vitriolic attackers. It’s a shame, but the optimism once fostered by the internet — that it would enhance mutual understanding and open minds — has been dashed. The digital world has become just another ideological battleground. There is another problem, however. Many of them are too convinced of their own intellectual abilities. They are the elites, they believe, and as such, know more than the country’s hoi polloi. They are confident they understand the West and Western culture and see themselves as candles illuminating China’s darkness. This air of superiority comes through in the articles they write. “Listen to me, you idiots,” they seem to say, though never quite in so many words. But how much are any of us really qualified to interpret the West? I can speak some English and have spent a few years living in Europe and the U.S. But while I once fancied myself something of an old hand when it came to the West, the past few years — even just the past few weeks — have done much to disabuse me of that notion. I couldn’t even begin to explain why people in the West seem so opposed to wearing face masks, for example, much less their policy choices. Of course, arrogance isn’t a disease limited to Chinese liberal intellectuals. If local officials in the central city of Wuhan had not been so confident they could control the situation three months ago, the novel coronavirus might never have become a nationwide epidemic. And if Western leaders had swallowed their pride, learned from China’s experiences, and applied tough preventive measures a month ago, that epidemic might never have morphed into a global pandemic. To borrow a line from Liu Cixin’s sci-fi epic “Three-Body” trilogy: “Weakness and ignorance aren’t barriers to survival, but arrogance is.” If there’s one lesson from China’s experience over the past three months, it’s that the novel coronavirus is a real threat. No one can anticipate what consequences it’ll bring, and we shouldn’t assume we can handle whatever it throws at us. Trying to score political points at a time like this, whether by supporting ineffective strategies just because they originated in the West, or stoking xenophobia by playing the blame game, is useless. The only way forward is to set aside our pride, be on guard against potential danger, and fight with everything we’ve got.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005351
Life After the Test Comes Back Negative,Thousands of COVID-19 patients have been given the all clear in China. But many feel the trauma is far from over.,2020-03-20,"On March 12, after Lin Qing met a long list of requirements to prove she was free of the virus that causes COVID-19, she was released from quarantine and could finally return home. But despite the good news, it was difficult to feel relieved. While Lin devoted herself to returning her suburban home to a livable state, her husband of more than 40 years was still battling the disease in an intensive care unit elsewhere in the city. Over the past six weeks of treatment and recovery, Lin has often thought back to the days before the couple received their diagnoses. She blames local officials who initially downplayed the risks, but also herself for not picking up on clues that her husband was infected — he’d complained of feeling tired and cold. She can’t help but think that, if she had connected the dots earlier, he could have been back home by now. “It’s really my fault — I ignored all of those signs,” the 64-year-old tells Sixth Tone. Lin is one of a growing number of people across China who have recovered from the novel coronavirus that began spreading late last year in her hometown Wuhan, in central China’s Hubei province. Though 3,248 people in China have died from COVID-19 as of Thursday, the number of people who have recovered, currently 71,150, is quickly catching up to the total figure of infections, at 80,967. But like Lin, many survivors are dealing with guilt, shame, and fears the disease might return. Those brave enough to resume their normal lives feel ostracized.  In 2004 after the SARS epidemic — which was caused by a similar virus but was smaller in scale — a survey of around 280 recovered SARS patients found that 16.4% felt depressed and 10% felt anxious three months after being discharged from the hospital. One in 10 was diagnosed with PTSD. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic is seemingly winding down in China, psychological experts are preparing for the mental health effects that are sure to follow. Before January, Lin, and her husband enjoyed a simple but comfortable life in retirement. They tended their garden, raised their dog, and helped their granddaughter with her homework. When she prepared meals, he would play the piano. Then, in the afternoon of Jan. 25, Lin’s husband fainted in the kitchen. “I was on the living room sofa reading messages about the outbreak of the ‘new pneumonia’ when suddenly I heard him saying ‘oh, no!’” says Lin, who, like all survivors in this story, requested the use of a pseudonym out of privacy concerns.  Both Lin and her husband tested positive for the novel coronavirus and were transferred to different hospitals. “Since Dec. 9, 1978, the day we got married, we always stayed together,” Lin says. “It’s not just that it was the first time for us to be separated for such a long time — to be apart under such circumstances, it’s been really hard for me to bear.” With just mild symptoms — a cough and a low fever — Lin gradually got better, and less than a month later tested negative for the virus in two successive exams and could soon move to a quarantine facility. There, she often spoke with other women, who told stories of how their husbands suddenly died. She worried about her own husband, whose condition had quickly deteriorated after being admitted to the hospital. Doctors sent Lin and her daughter only a few messages each day, rarely with good news. They haven’t dared ask for more, knowing how doctors were overworked during the epidemic in China, resorting instead to scouring the news in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Lin’s husband during a TV report about ICUs. “So far, no news is perhaps the best news,” Lin says, adding that this is how she comforts herself every day. Lin feels the women who have lost their husbands are somehow better off. The constant uncertainty can be debilitating, and from time to time all the news about COVID-19 overwhelms her. In those moments, she says, “I just want to forget everything about the pandemic.” Afraid of overtaxing her daughter, she doesn’t know who to turn to with her emotions. She’s resorted to sending messages to her husband’s phone, knowing he cannot hear them in his current state. “I put all my anxieties and worries into those voice messages. I hope that one day, when he’s recovered, he’ll know how we made it through this tough time.”  “From falling sick, to being hospitalized, to getting discharged, only one phrase could describe that whole process — a living hell,” Du Mingjun, a psychological counselor at Hubei Psychological Consultant Association, says, recalling how a patient described his feelings to her. Since mid-February, Du has been receiving more phone calls from recovered patients. They fear the virus might reoccur, following reports of discharged patients testing positive again. At the same time, they are struggling with being accepted back into society. For people who survived COVID-19 in places with relatively few cases, resuming their everyday lives is especially tough. “In a small city like the one I live in, one confirmed case will become the talk of the town,” Zeng Fan, from Shantou in the southern province Guangdong, tells Sixth Tone. The 33-year-old was one of 25 COVID-19 patients in the city of 5 million. Soon after his diagnosis, Zeng found out his name and address were circulating online.  Something similar happened to 20-year-old Xiao Ranran, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, along with her parents. When neighbors learned about the three cases in their residential compound, Xiao received abusive messages full of curses and threats. “They exposed our personal information online, and they monitored our apartment,” Xiao tells Sixth Tone. “No matter how I tried to explain, they would still swear at us.” Xiao, a college student, came under such psychological pressure that she was diagnosed with depression and underwent counseling. Apart from the bullying and worries about her parents, she received setback after setback when CT scans showed that her lungs had recovered, but 14 successive nucleic acid tests were still showing positive results for the virus. While more and more patients were discharged from the hospital, Xiao, who was the first confirmed patient admitted to the hospital, remained stuck in the ward. “I felt mentally broken down. I couldn’t accept those test results, and I felt like a total mess in my mind,” Xiao recalls. “I cried a lot, and I lost interest in everything. I became sleepless and slow, and I’ve had strong headaches and nightmares.” She doesn’t want to think about how her neighbors will react if she and her parents move back home. Zeng, the patient from Shantou, already experienced how the people around him responded to his return. He was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 12, and, after 14 days of quarantine, went back to the office. He immediately felt like an unwelcome guest. Some colleagues greeted Zeng with subtle suggestions that he’d better rest up at home. Others were blunt: “If there’s any chance you’re still in trouble, we’d all be in trouble,” he remembers them saying.  People tense up whenever Zeng coughs in the office — a result of the damage COVID-19 did to his lungs that can still result in occasional shortness of breath. “Everyone is avoiding going near my desk. They’d rather walk in a big ‘S’ than in a straight line,” he says. “Maybe their actions are unintentional, but they really hurt.” His neighbors are avoiding him as well. Zeng has become suspicious of himself too, and recently called local health care providers to see whether it would be possible to get tested again. Whenever his son or a colleague coughs, he reflexively thinks he must have infected them, that it’s his fault.  “This kind of emotion — shame — is very unfair,” says Du, the counselor. “Society imposed that feeling on them.” In Wuhan, local authorities seal the front door of recovered patients with paper strips as a way of enforcing another quarantine period, she says. “It’s a standard work process that isn’t wrong in itself, but it will put a stigma on the infected patients and their families.” When her quarantine was coming to an end, Lin, the Wuhan retiree, had a fight with her daughter on where she should go after being discharged. “My daughter asked me to live with them, but how can I do that?” Lin says. “My grandchild is only 11 years old, and maybe there’s still an infectious virus in my body.” Luckily, she has been welcomed back by her neighbors, and the company of her dog Echo — who had been taken care of by a nearby pet store — lends her some relief. “Echo makes the home vibrant again. But it is still incomplete without my husband,” she says. After staying in an ICU for 50 days, Lin’s husband is still experiencing high fevers and cannot breathe on his own. Though he opened his eyes for a few seconds several days earlier, a doctor told Lin that, even if he recovers, his brain is so damaged, he might end up in a vegetative state. “I disinfected his piano the day I came home, but I guess there isn’t a chance he could ever play it again,” Lin says. “But as long as he can come home, I will spend the rest of my life taking care of him.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005344
Chinese Fear COVID-19 Rebound as Overseas Students Rush Home,High-profile cases of people traveling while infected with the coronavirus and flouting mandatory quarantine orders upon arrival have not improved the Chinese public’s perception of returnees.,2020-03-20,"Chinese students abroad hoping to escape the escalating COVID-19 pandemic and be reunited with their families are encountering an unforeseen obstacle: compatriots who would rather they stayed away. Li is a sophomore at a university in New York City with a one-way ticket home to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. After her school moved all its classes online earlier this month for the remainder of the term, she started planning her trip home. Despite massive flight cancellations between the U.S. and China, Li managed to secure a seat on a direct flight from New York in the coming days. But the 15-hour flight cost her well over 15,000 yuan ($2,110). “Last year at this time, we could probably get return tickets for less than 5,000 yuan if we booked in advance,” Li told Sixth Tone. “But if I don’t go back now, I don’t know when I’d get the chance.”  Li said the main reason she wanted to come back is because she’s worried China might impose its own travel bans, or completely suspend incoming flights. She even booked a second ticket for a later date, just in case her first flight gets canceled at the last minute, which has been known to happen during the pandemic, she said. With the COVID-19 outbreak subsiding in China, which now reports just 7,300 active cases, the total number of infections in other parts of the world has surpassed 163,000 as of Friday. Meanwhile, several of China’s most internationally connected cities, such as Shanghai and Beijing, have been seeing more imported cases than domestic ones recently. On Wednesday, China reported no new domestic cases for the first time since the outbreak began, while 34 new imported infections were identified. To date, there have been 189 imported infections detected in China, according to the country’s National Health Commission. As a result, many people view returnees from overseas as harbingers of infection. On Wednesday, Beijing’s health authority said during a press conference that “students abroad should suspend their trips coming back to the country unless absolutely necessary,” citing the risk of becoming infected while traveling. In a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19, many provincial-level governments including Beijing and Shanghai have imposed strict quarantine measures on all travelers — locals and foreigners — arriving from overseas. Incoming passengers are required to self-quarantine for two weeks either at a designated hotel or at home, depending on local regulations. However, not everyone is following the rules, according to a few viral videos that have sparked outrage online. For example, many people demanded that a Chinese-Australian woman who flouted her mandatory quarantine to go jogging in Beijing be expelled from the country — a wish that was granted Thursday. In the following days, a short video of a domestic broadcaster condemning such violations went viral on Chinese social media. “When we were building our homeland, you were nowhere to be found. Now you come rushing back from a thousand miles away, spreading the virus all around,” the anchor says in the video. The clip has been shared over 45,000 times and received nearly 560,000 likes on microblogging platform Weibo.  “Now that the situation is worse here (abroad), I can understand why they’re concerned about us coming back,” Li said. “I’m not offended, but I think we also deserve to be understood if we choose to go home for whatever reasons.” But not all Chinese students abroad are as eager to go home. Xu Xiaofei, a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, plans to remain in the U.S. “It’s not like we’re running out of food anytime soon in New York,” Xu told Sixth Tone. Compared with crowded airports, he said he feels safer staying in the city. Xu admits there have been precedents of infected people returning to China knowing they might be sick. Earlier this month, a Chinese woman in the U.S. who thought she might have the coronavirus flew back to China, where she tested positive and, in doing so, prompted a police investigation. “That’s why people panic over returnees — the chaos we are seeing is what’s freaking people out,” Xu said. “Once the authorities figure out the best system to track and regulate returnees and make that information transparent, the situation will get better.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005340
Wuhan Police Apologize for Punishing Coronavirus Whistleblower,The move came hours after investigators announced that local authorities who had punished Dr. Li Wenliang for “spreading rumors” should correct their error.,2020-03-19,"Police in the central Chinese city of Wuhan issued an apology Thursday and announced the retraction of a letter of criticism against martyred coronavirus whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang. The apology came hours after the National Supervisory Commission, China’s top anti-corruption agency, released a report on an investigation into Li’s death and the events preceding it. The report had urged Wuhan’s public security officials to withdraw the letter and “hold the relevant people responsible.” “The letter of criticism issued by the Zhongnan Road police station was inappropriate, and the law enforcement process was nonstandard,” the commission concluded. Investigators found that the two signatures on the letter chastising Li for “spreading rumors” — officers surnamed Hu and Xu — were both signed by Hu. “Actually, Xu didn’t participate in their conversation,” the report said. The commission therefore determined that the local authorities should correct their error, withdraw the letter of criticism, hold the relevant individuals accountable, and inform the public of the action taken. “The Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to withdraw the letter of criticism and solemnly apologize to Li’s family,” the police wrote on microblogging platform Weibo. They also announced that Hu — the officer who forged a signature on the letter — and the police station’s deputy chief had been given a warning and a demerit, respectively. The investigation team was dispatched to Wuhan within hours of Li’s death, which triggered an enormous public outcry online. Li had become a household name in China because of two posts on social media: one in which he gave a timeline of his attempt to alert colleagues about a mysterious viral pneumonia and subsequent punishment by the authorities, and a later post in which he announced he had been diagnosed with COVID-19. The report gave a clearer timeline of the early stages of the outbreak. It said that in December, several hospitals in Wuhan began receiving patients with pneumonia of an unknown etiology. On Dec. 27, Zhang Jixian, a doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, reported three such pneumonia patients to her supervisor, which led to a report being filed to the local disease control center. Two days later, four more cases were detected in Zhang’s hospital. On Dec. 30, Wuhan’s health commission published two urgent documents about the mystery illness. Around the same time, local doctors were trying to alert their friends and colleagues, but some including Li were punished by their employers and the authorities. Now more than a month after Li’s death, hundreds of internet users are still leaving comments under his old Weibo posts ever day. Some simply wish him good morning or good night, while others have turned his account into a “tree hollow” where they can whisper their fears or shout their frustrations. “We know you can’t hear us anymore, but we still came here to tell you: There’s finally an apology — even though it’s too late,” one Weibo user commented on the doctor’s page. Correction: A previous headline for this story suggested the Wuhan police apologized for Li’s death. They apologized for a letter of criticism against Li for allegedly “spreading rumors.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005349
"To Learn About Pandemic Abroad, Chinese Sift Through Fake News",WeChat and Weibo are littered with “copy-and-paste” articles about foreign governments’ supposed responses to the coronavirus threat.,2020-03-19,"While COVID-19 has largely been brought under control in China, fake news about the coronavirus ravaging foreign countries is spreading online at an alarming rate. People who spend a lot of time on Chinese social media may recognize the following headline template: “(Country) under coronavirus: shops shut down, difficult to return home, it’s so hard to stay in (country)!!” Depending on which articles they’ve come across, they may recall Algeria, Indonesia, Egypt, or some other country as the subject of the article, though the content for each is largely the same. As COVID-19 infections fall in China but rise abroad, social messaging app WeChat has been flooded with fake news about the supposedly chaotic pandemic situations in foreign countries. An analysis published Wednesday by Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper said that, out of more than three dozen public accounts found to be spreading fake news, many were publishing nearly identical articles, with the only differences being the country’s name and a few minor details. The Paper’s analysis cited articles published by two public accounts called “Ethiopia Information for Chinese” and “Hungary Information for Chinese.” Both articles described how businesses in the respective countries had been severely affected by the pandemic, as told through the eyes of a Chinese person living there — a Mr. Xu in the Ethiopia story and a Ms. Liu in the Hungary story. Both articles said that although Xu (or Liu) was worried about the virus, he (or she) had resolved to remain abroad rather than return to China.  The analysis also traced the nearly identical articles to three companies in Fuqing, in the eastern Fujian province — a city that, like Wenzhou to the north, is known for its large number of emigrants abroad. Together, the three companies manage at least 68 different WeChat accounts that claim to share news from Europe, Africa, South America, and elsewhere in Asia. According to Shanghai Observer, another domestic outlet, the companies are controlled by three people in the same family: Guo Hong, Xue Yuming, and Guo Shiqiang. Guo Shiqiang bluntly told the outlet that the articles were fabricated in order to capitalize on people’s interest in the pandemic. Since there are lots of people from Fuqing working overseas, he had decided to share articles about the COVID-19 situation abroad in hopes of getting their attention, according to Shanghai Observer. Most of the trio’s spurious stories have been deleted by WeChat, and they are currently under investigation by local police. But such copy-and-paste content about how overseas countries are being overwhelmed by the coronavirus is still spreading among Chinese users on Twitter, with some posting about how “countless people have died in their homes,” or how there are “no test kits” in the U.S, Australia, France, and Japan, among other places. Fake news about the outside world isn’t a new phenomenon in China. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, many domestic companies were knowingly dealing in disinformation, relying on sensational and patriotic content to attract views, likes, and shares. They would translate news from unreliable sources or deliberately misrepresent information from credible ones. As COVID-19 went global, however, the fake news generators shifted into high gear. In early March, a hashtag translating to “U.S. CDC stops disclosing states’ confirmed infection data” went viral on microblogging platform Weibo, garnering over 500 million views. Because the vast majority of the accompanying posts neglected to mention that each state is now responsible for publicizing its own COVID-19 numbers, many in China assumed the U.S. was trying to conceal its outbreak data. “To think that U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said ‘I wish every country would share its coronavirus information openly and transparently, especially China,’” one Weibo user commented below a related media post. The preponderance of disinformation has led many in China to believe that foreign countries’ COVID-19 control and prevention measures are ineffective, if not outright stupid. This sentiment has culminated in the emergence of the social media buzzword “copy homework” — suggesting that other countries should follow China’s example and adopt more stringent containment policies. Meanwhile, on another front, fake news has cast the source of the novel coronavirus — once widely agreed to be the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan — into doubt. Since Chinese netizens and media misinterpreted, or deliberately misrepresented, a televised CNN headline reading “CDC confirms first coronavirus case of ‘unknown’ origin in U.S.,” a Weibo hashtag translating to “novel coronavirus originated in U.S.” has been viewed over 31 million times.  The spread of disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic may boil down to the Chinese authorities’ tolerance for nationalist discourse, according to Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s School of Journalism and Communication. “People are influenced by their existing beliefs and prejudices, and this affects how they receive information,” he told Sixth Tone. “Because of biases, people may not be willing to further fact-check the information they receive.” According to Fang, the spread of disinformation not only affects people’s understanding of the pandemic situation overseas, but also contributes to a self-satisfied mentality that inhibits people from learning from the crisis. “Disinformation has given people an excuse not to reflect on their own problems,” Fang said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005339
"Children Less Severely Affected by COVID-19, Scientists Find",Experts have suggested that fully functional thymus glands in children may be the key to their superior resistance to the coronavirus.,2020-03-19,"Are kids immune to the COVID-19 virus? The answer is no, but most infected children experience relatively mild symptoms that differ from those observed in adults, scientists say. Several studies show that children tend to have longer incubation and virus-shedding periods than adults. Family cluster infection is the major cause of cases in children, which can trigger community outbreaks if not identified in time, researchers warn. Wuhan Children’s Hospital is the only designated hospital for children confirmed with or suspected of COVID-19 infection. As of March 8, the hospital had treated 683 children, including confirmed and suspected cases. Of them, 419 were discharged. Staff at the hospital told Caixin that 32 newborns with COVID-19 made full recoveries, and four infants in critical conditions now no longer need ventilators. Most infected children and infants have mild symptoms, and severe cases account for only about 5% of those confirmed, according to Lu Xiaoxia, director of the respiratory department at the children’s hospital. Unlike adult patients, some children or newborn patients tend to have atypical symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, several studies on children’s clinical data show. This may make it even harder to identify infected kids. A study published March 13 by Nature Medicine assessed 10 children with COVID-19 at Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center. Researchers found that none of them experienced symptoms common in adult patients, such as difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, and nausea. The study found that seven children had fever, but no higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and one showed no symptoms at all. All 10 children were tested for the virus because they had been in close contact with diagnosed patients. Chest X-rays of the children were either normal or showed only coarse lung markings without unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. Few cases had leukopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, or elevated transaminase, which are frequently seen in adult patients, the study found. Another preprint paper published by The Lancet medical journal of 50 children reported similar findings. Forty-six patients, or more than 90%, had mild or very minor symptoms, and two had no symptoms at all, according to the authors, a team at Wuhan Children’s Hospital and Wuhan Tongji Hospital. The study showed that percentages of symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue were all lower than in adults, but slightly more children had diarrhea than adults. The underlying mechanism for less-severe symptoms in children is unknow, but scientists speculate it may be because of a fully functional thymus in children. The thymus gland aids in the production of T cells, which are crucial for the immune system. It is largest and most active in children, and begins to shrink and fade away in adolescence. Another phenomenon of concern in children with coronavirus is a longer intestinal detoxification cycle. As some child patients have diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms, special attention should be paid to avoid infection through feces and urine, researchers warn. One of the studies found that eight of 10 child patients had rectal swabs that tested positive, suggesting potential fecal viral excretion. Moreover, eight of 10 children demonstrated persistently positive tests of rectal swabs after their nasopharyngeal testing turned negative. The findings suggest that rectal swab-testing may be more useful than nasopharyngeal swab-testing in judging the effectiveness of treatment and determining the timing of termination of quarantine, researchers said.

"Chinese Shocked, Awed by UK’s ‘Darwinian’ Coronavirus Strategy","Some are impressed by the cold pragmatism of letting natural selection take its course, while others see it as an insult to the Chinese medical workers who lost their lives fighting on the front lines.",2020-03-18,"On Friday, the U.K.’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told a BBC Radio show that the British government would aim to limit — but not halt — the spread of COVID-19, on the grounds that it would be futile to try and stop the virus completely. Vallance told Sky News later that day that the government would aim to achieve “herd immunity” in Britain, saying that once around 60% of the population — some 40 million people — contract the coronavirus, the resulting pool of natural immunity will limit its impact. The day before, during an emergency committee meeting, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had bluntly admitted that “many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” and defended the U.K.’s comparatively limited actions taken against COVID-19.  Vallance’s and Johnson’s comments have spread like wildfire on social media in China, where extreme measures such as extended holidays, compulsory quarantines, and citywide lockdowns have been in place for close to two months. While they’ve succeeded in curtailing the spread of the virus, they’ve also crippled small businesses, entire industries, and the overall economy. On China’s dominant social app WeChat, articles and opinion pieces with headlines such as “UK officially admits: To achieve herd immunity, tens of millions must be infected” have been widely shared. A massive thread discussing Britain’s position on Q&A site Zhihu has received close to 10,000 answers — some filled with statistics and detailed mathematical formulas — and over 35 million views. Netizens are both shocked and amused by what they see as a brave yet foolish strategy for tackling the coronavirus, particularly in contrast with China’s heavy-handed but largely effective approach. “After successfully leaving Europe, they now want to leave the world,” read one widely shared quip. Others have described the strategy as an example of social Darwinism, or “survival of the fittest,” in action — fitting, given that the famed naturalist and father of evolution was British. “This shows just how scientifically astute developed nations’ approaches to virus prevention are,” read one tongue-in-cheek response in the Zhihu thread that received 87,000 upvotes. “Combatting the virus by employing the Darwinian model of natural selection highlights the unique appeal of modern science.”  On microblogging site Weibo, the state-run Global Times tabloid joked that Britain’s “herd immunity” strategy was the embodiment of “Keep Calm and Carry On,” the country’s unofficial slogan. Myriad imaginative theories — some more serious than others — about how the U.K. government arrived at their approach abound on the Chinese internet. Some wonder whether it is a premature admission of defeat, while others speculate that it could be intended as a means of population control. One recurring line of thinking argues that the cold pragmatism of herd immunity, combined with official inaction, are part of a clever ploy by Johnson’s government to incite a public panic that might ultimately lead to the freedom-loving people of Britain accepting harsh quarantine measures later down the road. “If they had just shut cities down, the British people definitely wouldn’t have agreed — they’d have said the government was limiting their freedom,” one WeChat user commented under a related article. “Better to just bluntly say that nothing is being done about the virus… This will rouse the people’s fury, and everyone will come out and petition for decisive action — then the prime minister will be within his rights to shut down cities.”  Alongside the jokes and sarcasm, however, many in China are outraged at the callousness of the herd immunity approach, which appears to accept the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives as collateral damage. The passive policy has even been viewed as an insult to the frontline medical staff who died fighting the coronavirus in Wuhan, and to the other countries that have sacrificed short-term economic growth in order to contain it. One popular response in the Zhihu thread said the strategy points to the inherent dangers of modern capitalism, under which economic priorities trump humanitarian considerations. Several related videos from the U.K. have gone viral in China. A clip of a heated Channel 4 debate between a defender of herd immunity and an opponent — who covers his face and waves his arms in despair at the prospect of imminent mass death — was widely shared on WeChat and Weibo. Videos of thousands of people attending a Stereophonics concert in Cardiff and a half marathon event in Liverpool, both over the weekend, have garnered millions of views in China. Meanwhile, online media outlet Pear Video has shared interviews with Chinese students currently studying in the U.K. who are worried about their health and safety.  Some Chinese outlets have since reported on the U.K. government’s clarification that herd immunity is not an official policy, but rather an inevitable byproduct of the virus — and that many media had got hung up on eye-catching headlines from Sky News, the Financial Times, and others. Chinese media have also reported about stricter containment measures in the U.K., such as enforcing a 14-day quarantine period for entire households if any family member shows flu-like symptoms. “New virus control measures introduced an urgent U-turn — has the UK abandoned the path of ‘herd immunity’?” read the headline of an article published Monday by the Chinese outlet Jiemian. “Being of two minds, swinging like a pendulum — how very British,” a WeChat user commented below it.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005329
"Change Your Chopstick Habits To Curb COVID-19, Cities Say",Local authorities are urging diners to stop dipping their utensils into communal dishes during the pandemic.,2020-03-17,"A new front has opened up in China’s “people’s war” against the novel coronavirus: the nation’s dinner tables. In recent days, local authorities across the country have been promoting the use of serving chopsticks and spoons, or gongkuai gongshao in Chinese, to prevent residents from unwittingly passing on the virus when they share dishes. Communal eating habits have been a part of Chinese culture for centuries, with groups typically sharing several dishes laid out in the center of a table. Officials are concerned, however, that diners may spread infections by dipping their own chopsticks and spoons into shared bowls of food. In a statement Sunday, the northwestern Qinghai province announced that all restaurants in the region would be allowed to reopen, but added that “providing serving chopsticks and spoons for each table would be encouraged to prevent cross-infection.” The next day, 10 provincial-level government agencies in the eastern Zhejiang province jointly issued a letter asking catering firms to provide serving utensils and encouraging local residents to use them both in restaurants and at home. In Beijing and Shanghai, local authorities have been promoting the use of serving utensils via posters and leaflets since late February. A day after the Shanghai government’s campaign began, 100 restaurants in the city announced they would provide serving implements with every dish, or provide each diner with individual dishes. On March 8, the eastern city of Taizhou issued detailed guidelines on serving utensils, requiring restaurants to clearly label and color-code communal chopsticks and spoons. A district in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu has also issued similar guidelines, local media reported Monday. The initiatives have generally been well-received by the public, though many have complained that it’s difficult to change their eating habits. A Beijing resident surnamed Zhan told local media outlet Beijing Daily that while her family had started using serving utensils, it had been difficult to convince her mother-in-law to observe the new rule, because the woman felt the use of serving chopsticks was cold and antisocial. “In the first few days, the elderly (family member) found it hard to get used to, and felt that it was creating distance between us,” said Zhan. “After a week or so, she gradually got used to it.” State media have also been encouraging the public to adopt the new habit. “There are many emotions expressed via the dinner table,” read a commentary in state-run outlet Guangming Daily. “If the idea that using serving chopsticks and spoons deliberately creates distance between people isn’t changed, it will be difficult to promote their use.” “Dinner table hygiene is an important part of public health, and civilized dining habits reflect a civilized society,” the article continued. “With the catering industry resuming business, healthy eating habits and maintaining good order while dining have become real issues for us. It’s related to people’s health and safety, and it’s also a personal responsibility during the pandemic.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005328
24 Hours in Post-Lockdown Shanghai,"Businesses have reopened. Traffic chokes the streets. But for many families, the COVID-19 crisis feels far from over.",2020-03-17,"SHANGHAI — Normality appears to be returning to China’s eastern metropolis. The roads are gridlocked. Metro stations are crowded once again with commuters. Over the past week, only 13 new COVID-19 cases have been confirmed citywide — all of them imported. But for many Shanghainese, the crisis feels far from over. The pandemic continues to shape their lives in myriad — and sometimes distressing — ways. To document the reality of life in a city struggling to emerge from lockdown, Sixth Tone asked three local residents to share their experiences over one 24-hour period: March 3. This is their story.  7:20 a.m.: The Daughter Bao Wei has a full day of work ahead of her as a human resources manager. But first, the 37-year-old stops at the Shanghai Cancer Center in downtown Xuhui District. She’s there to try — again — to secure an operation for her mother, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer this past October. China’s health care system has been disrupted by COVID-19 — which had infected over 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000 nationwide by March 3 — and scheduling nonessential procedures has become difficult. For Bao’s mother, the situation is even more complex, because the 64-year-old isn’t a registered Shanghai resident. She’s originally from the northeastern Heilongjiang province and only moved to the city four years ago to assist Bao with child care after she gave birth.  Only patients with a Shanghai ID are able to make appointments at the cancer center, but Bao feels she has no choice but to try anyway. Since her diagnosis, her mother’s cancer has already spread from her thyroid to the surrounding lymph glands. “My family can’t deal with the risks that a further delay of the surgery might bring,” says Bao. At the front door, security guards perform temperature checks on visitors using infrared scanners. Then, there’s another round of checks at the outpatient department: a second temperature test, a form detailing each person’s health conditions and travel history, and a check of each visitor’s health QR code — a new surveillance tool used by cities to track whether users have come into close contact with virus carriers. Bao insisted on coming alone to the cancer center, ordering her mother to stay at home. A large number of COVID-19 infections have taken place inside health care facilities in Wuhan, the heart of the initial virus outbreak, due to the large crowds of patients. After her first visit in mid-February — when the epidemic in China was at its peak — Bao isolated herself in a rented apartment for two days, terrified of endangering her 3-year-old daughter. After completing the security checks, Bao heads to the nurses’ station outside the doctor’s office. She explains her situation. Luckily, the nurses are sympathetic and assure her she’ll get a chance to talk to the doctor, who only has three appointments booked this morning. At 8:15 a.m., the doctor calls Bao into his office. But as soon as the doctor hears Bao’s mother is not a Shanghai resident, he rejects her request for an appointment.  Bao pleads with the doctor, explaining the urgency of her mother’s situation. The doctor relents slightly and suggests a possible workaround. He tells Bao to meet him at the cancer center’s Pudong site, on the other side of town, in the afternoon. Nonlocal patients can register there. But he advises Bao to bring documents proving her mother hasn’t left Shanghai during the past two weeks. Bao leaves the cancer center and heads back to her apartment, to search for the proof she’ll need.  8:30 a.m.: The Working Mom A few blocks away, Shen Dongmei is rushing to get ready for work. The 31-year-old is a teacher at a primary school in central Huangpu District, and today is the second day of classes since teaching resumed on March 2. For the time being, Shanghai’s schools are conducting all classes online, and this is putting working mothers like Shen under additional pressure. She has to take care of her students while also supervising her 4-year-old daughter. Shen was up early to make sure her daughter was washed, dressed, and fed by 8:30 a.m. Now, she gets the child settled in her bedroom with a radio app playing a story, so she can prepare for her first class of the day.  “I told her to listen to the stories and play with her toys on her own and not make any noise because Mom will be working,” Shen tells Sixth Tone. In Shanghai, each online class is split into two parts. First, a prerecorded 20-minute lesson is broadcast on TV to all students in town, from grade one to grade 12. Then, class teachers like Shen answer students’ questions about the lesson’s contents and help them complete the assigned homework. At 9:00 a.m., the first lesson begins. Today, it’s Chinese — the subject Shen teaches to a class of 31 fourth graders. After the video is over, Shen asks the students to record voice messages of themselves reciting the poems they’ve just learned and send them to her via voice messages. “I corrected their mispronunciations and incorrect pauses or emphasis,” says Shen. “For primary school students, we require them to be able to recite poems fluently and understand their basic meaning.” According to Shen, the students are mostly participating actively in the online classes, which take place using a special video and messaging app called Xiaoheiban. But four of her 31 students didn’t attend the class. “Later, I learned from their parents that these students had had their cell phones confiscated and couldn’t use the app,” says Shen.  Shanghai’s education authorities have forbidden teachers from forcing students to submit their homework online every day, to avoid overstressing the children during the pandemic. Shen, however, says she feels obligated to check up on absentees. “In my class, the kids come from very different family backgrounds — some parents are divorced, and others are simply too occupied with their businesses,” says Shen. “If their parents don’t care much about their (the students’) studies, I could be the only one who can push them forward.” When the students begin the day’s second video lesson at 10 a.m., Shen hops on a conference call with the other grade four Chinese teachers to discuss the day’s homework. These meetings can be time-consuming, but are unavoidable during the pandemic. “Students in Shanghai have been given textbooks, but there are no answers provided,” says Shen. “We haven’t been given the answers, either. That’s why we need to discuss them every day.”  10:10 a.m.: The Daughter Across town, Bao has arrived back at her residential compound in eastern Pudong New Area. She heads straight to the office of her local neighborhood committee, and asks the committee members to provide her with some kind of certificate to help her mother get treatment. The workers, however, are unmoved by Bao’s entreaties. “They asked me, ‘How can we tell your mom didn’t leave Shanghai during the past 14 days?’” says Bao. Bao tries a different approach. She texts her mother’s mobile carrier, China Mobile, which sends back a message confirming the cell phone’s owner has been in Shanghai for the past two weeks.  Armed with the SMS, Bao returns to the office and tries again to convince the committee to give her a certificate. Eventually, the workers give her a stamped letter stating that Bao’s mother is a resident in their compound, where no COVID-19 cases have been confirmed to date. It’s not exactly what she needed, but Bao hopes it’ll be enough. At 11 a.m., she finally returns to her apartment, opens her laptop, and starts work.  11:30 a.m.: The Father Nearby in Pudong New Area, another parent arrives at the gates of the local education bureau. The man, surnamed Li, has come to petition the bureau to allow his daughter to enroll in a local primary school. Competition for places at Shanghai’s top schools is fierce, and families often invest huge sums to secure a property located in a good school district. In 2018, Li — a marketing executive at a multinational firm — did just that, purchasing a 4 million yuan (then $620,000) apartment to give his daughter the chance to attend a nearby primary school. Construction on the new building was due to be completed in February, just in time for Li’s daughter to enroll in April. But COVID-19 has thrown the plan into chaos.  “Because of the pandemic, all construction sites in the city were shut down, including the one where my new home will be,” says Li, who declined to reveal his full name due to the sensitivity of the matter. In mid-February, Li and the other property owners received a letter from the developer, confirming the project would not be completed on time. The news puts Li’s daughter’s spot in the school at risk, as well as those of 30 other kids whose families invested in the new complex for the same reason. Several of the affected parents have agreed to meet at the education bureau. The plan is to lobby officials to make an exception to the normal enrollment procedures if the project is delayed beyond April. “We understand the severity of the pandemic and why the government has introduced control measures,” says Li. “But it shouldn’t be us — families with school-age children — who pay the price.” Li, however, got stuck on a long conference call at work, and the other parents have already left. He tries to get a meeting with the officials, but no one from the bureau is willing to see him, citing the pandemic. A security guard at the gate says the other parents submitted a petition letter for the authorities’ consideration.  12 p.m.: The Working Mom Shen has finished her morning lessons and is now busy preparing lunch. As she cooks, she teaches her daughter some new Chinese characters and reads her a few stories. “I feel like I’m a superwoman, making full use of every minute,” says Shen. The mother is relieved when 1 p.m. arrives and she can tuck her daughter in for a nap. While her child sleeps, she writes up a report for the school on the day’s lessons. Teaching online is proving to be much more time-consuming than classroom-based lessons, she says. “I have to repeat the same answer to different students as they message me questions individually,” says Shen. “Before, we would solve the problems together as a class.”  1:30 p.m.: The Daughter While the teacher composes her report, Bao waits anxiously outside the doctor’s office at the Shanghai Cancer Center’s Pudong site. She arrived half an hour before he was due to start receiving patients, but there are still 12 people ahead of her in line. At 3 p.m., it’s finally Bao’s turn. To her relief, the doctor tells her he’s already talked to the hospital about her mother’s urgent need for surgery. Before the hospital accepts her into the inpatient department, however, Bao has to sign a form stating that she and her mother do not have any COVID-19 symptoms and haven’t left Shanghai or had contact with anyone infected with the virus in recent weeks.  “The doctor stressed that anyone making a false statement would bear legal consequences — not just to me, but to other patients as well,” says Bao. “I completely understand the difficulties from the hospital’s side … Honestly, I’m deeply concerned about possible cross-infections inside the hospital as well.” By 3:20 p.m., Bao has managed to secure her mother an operation in two weeks’ time. Despite the difficulties she’s endured, she wonders whether the pandemic has actually made it easier for her mother to get treatment quickly. “Most patients who don’t need live-saving surgery have chosen to postpone their operations,” says Bao. “But for cancer patients whose conditions are quickly deteriorating, COVID-19 isn’t nearly as horrible as cancer. And hospitals are prioritizing treatment for them.”  4 p.m.: The Father Li returned to the office after his failed visit to the education bureau, but in the afternoon he decides to visit the construction site. He’s in a chat group with around 400 of the other property owners through messaging app WeChat, and many of them have been very active in petitioning their cases, calling government hotlines and emailing local authorities to complain. Their persistence has inspired Li to make further efforts. To his disappointment, however, the complex looks exactly as it did in mid-January. “The construction waste is still laying there. No workers can be seen. No staff with the property developer can be reached, even though they have an office there,” says Li.  4:30 p.m.: The Working Mom Afternoon lessons are finally over in Shanghai. The final class of the day was ethics, asking students to share their thoughts about “learning to show respect.” “I asked them to combine the topic with the ongoing pandemic,” says Shen. Normally, Shen would leave the office shortly after classes finished at 4 p.m. Today, however, it feels like she’s about to start another shift. She prepares some snacks for her daughter, turns the storytelling app back on, and tells her not to interrupt her mother for a few hours.  “I gave her some peas — she’ll often stay quiet peeling peas for as long as an hour,” Shen laughs. By 4:30 p.m., Shen has collected all the day’s homework from the other subject teachers, combined them into one document, and sent it to her class via Xiaoheiban. The students are supposed to complete the homework before 6 p.m., when the teachers will announce the correct answers. Then, the children should correct any errors before sending back photos of the completed assignments on Xiaoheiban. In reality, though, the teacher spends most of the 90 minutes replying to questions from her students. “Whenever your Xiaoheiban app rings, you have to check the incoming message,” says Shen. “If the students have made a mistake, you have to message them to explain what’s wrong and why.” Shen is relieved when her husband arrives home from work at 6 p.m. and can take over child care and cooking duties. “I’m busiest between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., when most of the homework comes in,” says Shen. “But the latest assignment arrived at 9:30 p.m.”  10:30 p.m.: The Father and The Daughter Li doesn’t finish replying to work-related emails until well after 10 p.m., as he was out of the office so long during the day. He tells Sixth Tone he’ll probably need to take some time off work to continue petitioning the education bureau over the following days. “Families in Shanghai are investing all they have to get their children into a desirable school — mine is no exception,” says Li. “I have only one child. We’ll make all efforts possible to get her enrolled.”  Bao also stays awake late into the night. Her working hours are flexible, and so her job isn’t a source of stress, she says. But she’s deeply worried about her mother’s health. In recent days, the retiree has been running a low fever. “Some cancer patients have this issue,” says Bao. “But what if she runs a fever on the day we receive the hospital admission notice? That could be problematic.”  Postscript Over the following days, Sixth Tone reached out again to the three interviewees for an update on their situations. Li says the property developer had promised to complete the new homes by late April, which might make it possible to enroll Li’s daughter on time. Teacher Shen is still working from home. She has sent her daughter to live with her grandparents in suburban Shanghai for the time being, to make it easier for Shen to cope with her increased work pressure. Bao’s mother finally had an operation at Shanghai Cancer Center on March 12. The procedure was successful, and she is recovering well.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005324
It’s Time to Stop Tokenizing Female Medical Staff,"Mainstream media outlets keep trying to turn female medical workers into stereotypical, self-sacrificing heroes. Audiences want to see their human side.",2020-03-16,"There are currently more than 100,000 female medical professionals working in the central province of Hubei, the heart of the country’s COVID-19 epidemic. Together, they account for more than half of the province’s health care workers and 90% of its nurses. In other words, women have made huge contributions to the battle against COVID-19, which has sickened 81,000 and killed 3,200 in the country as of March 16, including dozens of medical workers. Unsurprisingly, their heart-wrenching stories have been covered widely in domestic media, often powerfully. Yet several efforts to valorize female medical workers by the country’s “mainstream” media — a constellation of largely state-backed outlets uniquely well-positioned to set the public agenda — have fallen flat, arousing public ire for their reliance on outdated tropes like female suffering or extreme collectivist self-sacrifice.  In one widely criticized example, female hospital workers in the northwestern province of Gansu were filmed crying as they had their heads shaved. In other cases, outlets came under fire after publishing profiles of women who stayed at their posts despite being eight or even nine months pregnant, or who returned to work less than two weeks after a  miscarriage. Taken together, they suggest a growing gap between the values of some hidebound mainstream outlets and the audiences they purport to reach.  China isn’t the only country where heroism is repackaged into patriotic content. In times of crisis or difficulty, these stories bring people together, steady popular sentiment, and drum up feelings of national pride or unity. Well-known examples in China range from socialist oiler Wang Jinxi in the 1960s to teachers who died protecting their students during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. This time, the narrative appears to have misfired. While the above-mentioned reports ostensibly shower women with praise, critics have expressed frustration, even anger, with the way they appropriate the female body and repackage women’s sacrifices into overarching narratives of national glory — even as hospital leaders, local institutions, and others ignore or minimize women’s everyday needs.  This shift in public attitudes can partly be traced to a growing awareness among Chinese, and especially young Chinese, of gender issues. Many quickly realized that mainstream reports were blind to the intelligence and skills of the women they profiled while appropriating their bodies to rouse audiences into compassion and action. Although women have made great strides in modern China, both inside and outside the home, many continue to struggle with stereotypical portrayals of their bodies in media, as well as with their status as the “second sex.” Some outlets in particular fall into the trap of focusing on what makes women different from the male “default” — their physical appearances, their reproductive organs, their roles as mothers — instead of treating them as fully formed individuals. Just because women’s bodies are celebrated doesn’t always mean they’re appreciated. Female frontline workers have seen many of their needs go unmet. Feminine hygiene products, for example, have been treated as less of a priority, even overlooked altogether, by those in charge of collecting and allocating material aid. Even when some charities expressed a willingness to donate menstrual pads, they were flat-out rejected by male hospital managers. And in a country where “menstruation” is still considered a dirty word, even paeans to female sacrifice generally steer clear of the subject: In an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television, a nurse at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, near the center of the outbreak, spoke at length about the physical toll of caring for patients. In the process, she mentioned she was on her period.  “I’m on my period, and I’m having abdominal pains,” she noted. When the segment was later rebroadcast, that particular remark had been edited out. It’s not all bad news. A number of civilian volunteers and feminine product companies began organizing donation drives since early February, and more regions, including Shanghai and the southwestern province of Guizhou, have begun providing hygiene products to female medical staff. Yet in a still male-dominated society, it’s all too easy for the men making the decisions — the above-mentioned hospital leaders, for example — to mistake their perspectives as universal, while neglecting the legitimate needs of others. It’s also important to remember that the decision to make a sacrifice should be voluntary, not mandatory. True sacrifice requires an individual to deeply understand the value of their life and the potential risks involved in their actions, and to nevertheless willingly choose to take the risk in question.  That means they cannot have been pressured into doing so. At least until the 1990s, the ideal of collectivist self-sacrifice — unconditionally giving one’s life for the greater good — dominated Chinese mainstream discourse. Now, however, we are more likely to question whether the people involved truly had a choice and whether their rational interests were protected. The nine-months-pregnant nurse; mothers being forced to give up breastfeeding their kids; a woman who returned to work 10 days after her miscarriage — whereas older generations might have unquestioningly accepted these as instances of heroism, young Chinese see individual lives being trivialized. Their selfless contributions and efforts are meant to save people — but why must one life be sacrificed for another? The irony is, there’s no need for the media to fabricate drama about women being forced to choose between their lives, families, or bodies and their sense of duty. All frontline workers — men and women alike — have done more than enough to earn our respect and gratitude. People are already rooting for them to return home safely. Some seem to grasp this better than others. Much of the media’s coverage has been professional, even extraordinary. Last month, the market-oriented Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper was widely praised for its series of close-up portraits of frontline doctors and nurses. By not limiting their focus to men or women, the paper’s photographers were free to concentrate on the struggles and scars shared by all frontline health care workers: the bags under their eyes and the deep lines left by days of wearing surgical masks. It felt human rather than inflammatory, but was inspiring all the same. I’m not suggesting we don’t honor or report on people who are saving lives. Every country creates its own heroes. At this critical moment, however, frontline medical staff need reinforcements and material support, not exaggerated flattery. Instead of trying to canonize them or turn them into comic book superheroes, we should start by improving their working conditions and guaranteeing their basic rights and needs. Over the past two months, Chinese audiences have repeatedly shown they care for and respect the individual will and authentic humanity of the people they choose to lionize. That’s a remarkable development, and I believe it heralds a bright future for society.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005289
Study Finds No Evidence of Maternal-Fetal Transmission of COVID-19,"Of the four newborns of mothers infected with the coronavirus, none showed symptoms, and the three that were tested returned negative results.",2020-03-16,"Doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhan have found no evidence that mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus to their children during pregnancy. The results of their study were published Monday in the scientific journal Frontiers in Pediatrics. While the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has mostly spared young children, whether infected mothers can pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy has remained unclear. Experts raised concerns over “possible vertical transmission from mother to infant” after a case in Wuhan of an infected woman’s infant testing positive for the virus 30 hours after birth. To investigate the issue further, doctors at Wuhan Children’s Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital studied four pregnant women with COVID-19. All were diagnosed during their final trimester of pregnancy, and each gave birth to a full-term baby. All of the newborns were isolated from their mothers immediately after birth and fed with formula. Doctors ran nucleic acid tests for three of the babies, while the fourth baby’s guardians refused the test. The three tests were negative for the coronavirus, and none of the babies, including the untested one, exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever or cough — though one experienced some difficulty breathing after birth. That baby had tested negative, and a chest radiograph showed different features from COVID-19. He was diagnosed with transient tachypnea of the newborn — a temporary and not-uncommon condition potentially caused by the delayed clearing of fetal lung fluid. The infant had recovered by day four. The results of Monday’s study are consistent with retrospective reports from two research teams published in the journals Translational Pediatrics on Feb. 10 and The Lancet on Feb. 12. Each team studied nine mothers and their newborns in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and found no evidence that the virus could cross the placenta and infect babies during pregnancy. The Lancet study also tested infected mothers’ amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and breast milk, in addition to administering nucleic acid tests for the newborns, all of which came back negative. The most recent study did not conduct this full spectrum of tests. The authors of Monday’s study acknowledged that nucleic acid tests are not always reliable in diagnosing COVID-19. Current data suggests that the test is accurate in 70% of cases, the team said in their paper. “Therefore, the reliability of diagnostic test should be further evaluated especially for children,” they wrote. “So far, the literature does not suggest a role for mother-to-newborn transmission during pregnancy or delivery,” Megan Freeman, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine, told Sixth Tone. “Some newborns have acquired COVID-19 after being born... but that is most likely through respiratory droplets or close contact with infected family members.” Experts say that because there are so few cases of infants born to mothers with COVID-19, it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions for now. “This is not a situation where we can design an experiment and control sample size,” Freeman said. “We must learn from the instances that exist as best we can.” The placenta can keep many viruses, including HIV, from contacting the unborn baby, but it’s not an ironclad system: Some pathogens such as the rubella virus can pass through and infect the fetus. “There is still much to learn about what allows some pathogens in and keeps other pathogens out,” Freeman said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005316
Woman Denied COVID-19 Test in US Confirmed Positive in Beijing,"Some overseas Chinese are returning home due to the coronavirus pandemic, while others who’ve decided to remain abroad are becoming increasingly concerned.",2020-03-15,"Update: Beijing police announced Monday that the woman who returned to the capital after allegedly being denied COVID-19 tests in the U.S. is under investigation for lying to the flight crew, and that she could face charges of impeding outbreak control efforts. A woman who tested positive for COVID-19 Friday in Beijing had been denied coronavirus tests three times in the United States, according to the Chinese capital’s disease control authority. “From her first visit to a Massachusetts hospital on March 3 to her fourth visit on March 11, when a CT scan showed infections in her lungs, the woman — who was running a high fever — was denied a coronavirus test three times,” Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a press conference Saturday. The woman had arrived in Beijing Thursday afternoon with her husband and son, who are being treated as suspected cases. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are three groups of people who should be tested for COVID-19: hospitalized patients showing symptoms of the disease; other symptomatic individuals who may be at greater risk, such as older adults or those with chronic medical conditions; and people who were in close contact with a suspected or confirmed patient, or who recently traveled to an affected area. People who are sick and suspect they may be infected are advised to call their doctors and stay home. As of noon Sunday, over 75,000 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed outside China, with Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, France, and the U.S. recording the most infections. Worldwide, the virus has infected some 156,400 people, more than 5,800 of which have died. To prevent the coronavirus from spreading in Shanghai, Pudong New Area, where the city’s major international airport is located, had by Friday morning set up 18 quarantine sites to accommodate around 5,000 at-risk returnees. While people returning to China are admitted to hospital if they test positive for COVID-19, many Chinese abroad say they plan to stay put to ride out the pandemic. Ni Jian, a Chinese woman living in New York, said that although the coronavirus seems to be spreading rapidly in the city, it has not yet significantly impacted her daily life. “For schools and businesses, everything remains normal,” Ni told Sixth Tone. Since the spouse of one of her co-workers tested positive for COVID-19, Ni has been working from home. The mother of two children said she has no idea whether coronavirus tests are being made available at local hospitals. “I only know that you’re supposed to call your doctor for further information if you run a fever,” she said. With her family’s roots now firmly planted in New York, Ni said she hasn’t considered returning to China. Wang Xi, who lives in Boston, said she hasn’t thought of returning to China either — though she’s trying to figure out how to send her father, who has been staying with her in the U.S., home. “Life in Boston has been greatly impacted by the virus. The main universities in the state of Massachusetts have gone online for classes, and most public schools have closed,” Wang, who also has two children, told Sixth Tone. “Old people like my father are vulnerable to the virus, but given that our home city of Wuhan is still under lockdown, it’s difficult for him to go back.”  In Boston, there are strict COVID-19 testing criteria, according to Wang. “You have to show the exact symptoms and provide evidence of exposure,” she said after checking with her doctor. “This may be due to a shortage of test kits.” Jane Rong said she’s nervous about the ongoing pandemic, as there have been confirmed cases in the area of Washington, D.C. where she lives, and because her son, a medical student, is interning at a nearby hospital. “He’s basically a frontline doctor now — I’m very concerned about his safety. But he comforts me and insists he’s totally safe, and that being nervous only lowers one’s immunity,” Rong, who is in her late 50s, told Sixth Tone. She added that the city recently began designating certain clinics to receive fever patients. In Sweden, a country with nearly 1,000 confirmed cases, resident Tian Wen said it’s not easy for people running a fever to get tested for the coronavirus. “You have to first make a phone call to find out whether you meet the criteria for a hospital visit,” she told Sixth Tone from her home in Stockholm. “If your symptoms are mild and you’re not so old, you won’t be given an appointment with a doctor.” Tian added that, based on her impression, Stockholm is struggling to cope with its COVID-19 patients. “The city seems to have given up on preventing the virus and is instead more focused on treating confirmed patients with severe symptoms,” she said. The 36-year-old mother of two said public schools in the city are still in session, though she took her children out of class two weeks ago. “People are going about their work as usual,” she said. “I don’t know how much it helps for families to keep their kids at home if the parents are still going out for work, still having meals in restaurants.”  While going back to China is still an option, Tian said it’s hard to book a flight. “There’s also a high risk of infection from staying in the enclosed environment of a plane for 12 hours,” she said. Meanwhile, few masks can be seen on the streets of Stockholm. “It’s not because people don’t want to wear them, but because they’re not available anywhere in the city now,” Tian said. In Bielefeld, a German city with a population of around 333,000, kindergartens and schools will suspend classes from Monday, according to Zhang Yingzhi. “The city has confirmed 17 cases so far, but people aren’t really worried about the situation,” Zhang, a Bielefeld resident, told Sixth Tone. “Almost no one is wearing a mask in the streets. Only medical workers here wear masks, and the local disease control authority says it’s useless (for healthy people) to wear masks. If you wear a mask on the street, you’re either going to be teased for overreacting or assumed to be contagious.” Zhang admitted that she has thought about flying back to China, given the pandemic situation in Germany, but with her husband’s job and their son’s school in Bielefeld, the family have decided to stay. “After all, it would probably be even riskier to get on a plane,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005318
"No Free COVID-19 Treatment for Dishonest Patients, City Says","Amid strict screening of people arriving from abroad, one Chinese city has imposed a no-reimbursement rule for patients who lie about their health conditions or travel histories.",2020-03-14,"Authorities in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan announced Saturday that they will not provide free coronavirus-related medical treatment to people arriving from abroad who lie about their travel histories or contact with confirmed patients, or who refuse to comply with local outbreak control and prevention measures — regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign. Weeks after COVID-19 was detected in the central city of Wuhan, the Chinese government announced on Jan. 23 that it would offer free treatment to anyone infected with the novel coronavirus. Five days later, authorities expanded the free-treatment plan to cover suspected cases as well. Tangshan hasn’t recorded any new cases of COVID-19 in the past 20 days, though two patients remain hospitalized out of 58 total cases confirmed in the city. Meanwhile, numbers of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan have held steady in single digits over the past three days, even as China must now deal with the risk of infected people arriving from abroad, especially hard-hit countries like Italy, Iran, and South Korea. The coastal city of Tangshan lies just across the Bohai Sea from Seoul. On Friday, seven COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Gansu province among passengers arriving from the U.S., Italy, and Saudi Arabia. By the end of the day, nearly 100 similar cases had been reported in China. Dozens of ambulances and epidemic control officers were dispatched to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday after four passengers arriving from Frankfurt recorded irregular temperatures. They, along with their companions and two others who admitted to taking anti-flu medication before boarding the flight, were taken to hospital, while 30 others from the flight deemed to be at high risk of infection were quarantined, as were all 13 members of the flight crew. Apart from these suspected COVID-19 cases, Shanghai confirmed four cases on Friday, all of them travelers from Italy. “Shanghai is definitely under huge pressure to screen potential infected passengers arriving from abroad,” said Xu Wei, a resident of a Pudong New Area residential compound where one COVID-19 case was confirmed Thursday. “For us average residents, we’re also at risk when foreign countries don’t take the virus seriously.” The Pudong patient, a Chinese citizen working in the U.S., had arrived in Shanghai from New York on Tuesday, and had stayed at home until developing symptoms on Thursday. “Homestay quarantine makes those of us living in the same area with the patient feel upset,” Xu told Sixth Tone. “Because the virus is so tricky and people can arrive without symptoms even if they’ve already been infected, it puts our home city at great risk. If people lie, it will make the situation even worse.” A case confirmed Wednesday in Zhengzhou, capital of the central Henan province, attracted national attention this week. The 29-year-old patient had traveled from Beijing to Abu Dhabi, then onward to Milan and Paris, between March 1 and March 6. He caught a train in Beijing and arrived March 7 in Zhengzhou, where he went straight back to work. The man ran a fever on March 10, but he and his family lied about his travels abroad. After he was ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19, his name became a trending hashtag on microblogging platform Weibo, attracting 480 million views by Saturday afternoon. Thousands of people have blamed him and his family for what they see as flagrant irresponsibility. Prior to this case, Henan — one of the most populous provinces in China — had not recorded a single new COVID-19 infection for 12 days. Similar cases of people lying about their health conditions or travel histories have also been reported in Beijing. Two people took anti-fever medication before boarding a flight from Italy to Beijing on March 4, and did not honestly report their health conditions upon arrival. Both later tested positive for the coronavirus. Legal experts say such disingenuous behavior can constitute impeding the control and prevention of infectious diseases, with violators facing up to seven years in prison, according to China’s criminal law.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005317
China’s Keyboard Warriors Attack Vlogger’s Apology for COVID-19,"Nihao Zhuzi deleted a post in which she had expressed regret that the coronavirus is spreading in other countries, after angry netizens insisted she had nothing to be sorry for.",2020-03-13,"Chinese netizens are lashing out at a popular vlogger after she felt compelled to apologize for the coronavirus as it spreads rapidly in other countries. “I know the global pandemic is in many cases out of our control, but after seeing what’s happening in Europe, I can’t help but say sorry a million times from the bottom of my heart,” the blogger, Nihao Zhuzi, wrote Wednesday on microblogging platform Weibo. The post sparked immediate backlash, with netizens saying they were disappointed by Zhuzi’s words and would unfollow her. Before this week, Zhuzi was a widely adored online personality whose lifestyle vlog had attracted 3.6 million followers. “She is taking Chinese people’s money while at the same time kissing foreign ass,” wrote one Weibo user. “After marrying a foreigner, she forgot where she was born,” wrote another user, referring to Zhuzi’s partner. To criticize Zhuzi for allegedly not standing in solidarity with China during a time of crisis, some netizens described her as a “banana person” — a pejorative term for a person who has yellow skin but a “white mindset.” Zhuzi said she deleted her post amid the flood of negative comments. In a later post only visible to her followers, she explained that, given “the disaster that the whole world is experiencing, ‘feeling sorry’ is just the personal reaction of a normal human being.”  According to Zhang Li, a scholar specializing in race, gender, and media, the cultural framing of unwavering patriotism as a social responsibility is not only wrong, but also an act of violence in itself. However, Zhang — who asked to use a pseudonym for fear of experiencing similar online backlash — sees Zhuzi’s apology as somewhat problematic, too. “She comes across as a person with cosmopolitan beliefs that transcend race,” Zhang told Sixth Tone. “However, in times like this (when China is being accused of causing the current pandemic), one must realize that it’s not true — and we’re being reminded of the fact that, in the eyes of some Europeans, our skin tone is never ‘neutral,” she added, referring to instances of racism against Asian people during the pandemic. “However, even when this is happening, she seems to worry more about causing trouble for the Europeans than about being racially profiled herself.” The backlash against Zhuzi is consistent with a rhetorical shift in China, where COVID-19 is largely being brought under control, even as cases continue to climb abroad. On Friday, a hashtag translating to “Chinese medical experts fly to Italy with supplies” trended on Weibo, with many users saying they felt lucky to be in China. By Friday evening, the hashtag had received over 28 million views. “After experiencing this, I realize how good my life is in China. During this period (of COVID-19 spreading aboard), foreign countries’ (control and prevention measures) look like a joke to me,” a Weibo user commented below a related media post. Such sentiments have been voiced in China before, during other countries’ times of crisis. In mid-January, an article titled, “If it weren’t for the Australian bushfires, I wouldn’t have known China was so powerful 33 years ago” went viral online. It contrasted the Chinese government’s swift response to a deadly wildfire in the northeastern Heilongjiang province in 1987 with the Australian government’s failure to contain the fires that swept through the country’s east coast beginning in June 2019. This apparent schadenfreude drew criticism from scholars like Fang Kecheng, who argued that in 1987, the official narrative had been to frame the response to the fires as a national triumph, even as Chinese journalists at the scene were doggedly reporting on the destruction and chaos. “Netizens often take to Weibo in order to express national pride, especially when the Chinese government responds swiftly and reliably to humanitarian disasters in foreign lands,” Han Le, an assistant professor at the Center for Integrative Studies of Michigan State University, wrote in a 2017 commentary about Weibo’s role in amplifying Chinese nationalism. In her article, Han said Chinese netizens tend to express gratitude and confidence in the government when there are disasters overseas, as in the cases of the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. However, according to the well-known Hong Kong writer and critic Leung Man-tao, while there may be a time for voicing national pride, it shouldn’t overlap with the misfortunes of others. “The behavior of using other people’s suffering to praise one’s own condition not only lacks empathy, but also stands in opposition to decency,” Leung wrote in a criticism of the nationalist bushfire article.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005313
COVID-19 and China’s Forbidden ‘Cities Within Cities’,"As the novel coronavirus spread, the country’s closed-off residential neighborhoods shut their gates.",2020-03-13,"Last month, faced with a nationwide outbreak of COVID-19 that would go on to kill 3,180 and sicken 78,000 more as of March 13, local officials across China responded with a host of novel, if occasionally draconian, containment measures. These ranged from routine temperature checks and big data tracking to “hardcore” methods like traffic bans and citywide lockdowns. In urban areas, at least, one of the most common practices involved sealing off residential communities one-by-one throughout entire cities. Officials’ work was made easier because many of the residential developments built over the past 30 years are gated communities, with perimeter walls, security guards, surveillance cameras, and easily monitored gates — all paid for by the residents themselves via property management fees. Although many places have loosened their containment policies in recent weeks, at its height, dozens of cities kept strict control over who was entering and exiting compounds, with some even limiting residents to a single trip outside the community gates once every few days. For as useful as these features have been for local governments over the past month, the proliferation of gated communities in the reform era has long been a sore spot for urban planners, central officials, and — increasingly — the residents themselves. Originally meant to lure in privacy-starved urbanites tired of collectivist, workplace-arranged living quarters, they have become “cities within cities” — sites of poor, nearly privatized governance that distort the physical landscape and social ecology of urban areas. In many countries, gated residential compounds are largely the exclusive province of the wealthy. Not so in China, where they have become almost standard for middle-class urbanites since the late 1970s. Prior to the advent of “reform and opening-up” in 1978, most urban residents lived in communal housing assigned by their workplaces. These collective-style residences were defined by their small living areas, in which multiple families might share a kitchen or bathroom. Generally speaking, they were not particularly comfortable, and living in close proximity with one’s colleagues left little room for privacy. So when large-scale commercial urban housing developments began cropping up in the ’90s, early homebuyers were eager for something new. Real estate developers responded by making privacy, exclusivity, and status central to their residential design and sales strategies. Buying up large plots of land from cash-hungry municipalities, they built huge developments with little thought to transit links or road networks.  Unsurprisingly, this caused headaches for urban planners. With so much space walled off, cities became much less walkable, and roads had to snake around community boundaries. This is one reason why Chinese cities have a lower density of road networks than their counterparts in developed countries. In 2016, the international edition of the party-run People’s Daily newspaper described gated compounds as the “clogged arteries of cities.” Residents, too, have learned that walls come at a price. Closed off from the rest of the city, they are often at the mercy of their compound’s property management company, which interposes itself between residents and the local government. These companies provide basic services like waste management to communities, paid for by residents’ property management fees. Local governments are content with this situation, because it eases pressure on public services and already strained municipal budgets. For property management companies, gated communities are a reliable cash cow.  In theory, communities should be run by residential committees, but these are hard to form and fragile in practice. Property managers, brought in to serve residents, often fill this vacuum by taking on a management role. This isn’t always to residents’ benefit: Property management firms’ accounting practices are frequently opaque, their fee structures outlandish. Yet under current law, it is extremely hard for communities without a strong, organized residential committee to cancel their contracts. Caught between local governments’ eagerness to duck responsibility for neighborhood management and the pursuit of profits by property management companies, homeowners are in a very vulnerable position. Companies looking to pad their bottom line rarely see any reason to compromise with homeowners, and disputes have become commonplace. Gated living has more insidious effects, too, including sorting homeowners according to class or wealth. This sort of residential-based segregation is common worldwide, but the ubiquity of gated communities in China only further reduces the odds of people from different backgrounds interacting with one another.  In recent years, the country’s central authorities have begun to push back against the ubiquity of gated-off neighborhoods, whether newly built or Maoist-era workplace housing. In 2016, the national government issued a document demanding local officials address the issue. It also promoted the more open “block system,” in which cities would be prevented from building new closed residential compounds and required to gradually open up existing gated communities to through-traffic. The ongoing pandemic, with its emphasis on hardcore neighborhood-based containment measures, has quickly deflated what little momentum the campaign had, however. Many compounds have started to implement visa-style “pass” systems, strictly limiting the number of people allowed to enter and exit each day. Some residents have been even more proactive and demanding than local officials, setting up their own checkpoints, “interrogating” nonresidents who do not have the required pass, and even refusing entrance to residents who have returned from hard-hit areas. Given the circumstances, it’s understandable that residents would seek to protect themselves. But this renewed enthusiasm for closed-off, protective neighborhoods could pose problems if the government ever wants to get back to promoting open communities. Concerns over property values and safety meant that effort was already controversial, and among the residential committee members, property management employees, and local cadres I’ve spoken with, there is a fear that the pandemic could reinforce the legitimacy of closed-off communities in ways that will linger for years to come. “Closed fortress”-style neighborhoods have already left their mark on the urban ecology, social landscape, and governance of China’s cities. As they grow more entrenched, residents and officials alike would do well to keep an eye on this phenomenon and closely track any developments.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005259
The Chinese Citizens Caught in Russia’s COVID-19 Crackdown,"After Russia passed tough rules to contain the novel coronavirus, 80 Chinese nationals were detained and put on trial. Many had no idea what they’d done wrong.",2020-03-13,"On her fourth night in a Russian detention center, Sisi lay awake in bed. She got out her phone, which she’d managed to conceal from the guards, and began tapping out her thoughts. “Today is my 18th day in Moscow,” she wrote. “It’s already probably been two hours since lights out, but I can’t sleep because the guard outside is coughing and sniffing loudly. Aren’t we in the middle of an epidemic?” The young Chinese had arrived in Russia on Feb. 19. She had planned to spend a few days sightseeing in Moscow, but her trip took an unexpected turn as the Russian government rolled out tough measures designed to contain the spread of COVID-19.  Moscow’s rules stated that everyone arriving from China — regardless of their nationality — was required to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. The penalty for foreign citizens violating the policy was deportation and a five-year ban from returning. By Feb. 28, Russian authorities had rounded up 88 people — 80 of whom were Chinese — that had violated the quarantine rules. Sisi was among them. As of March 9, after two weeks of quarantine in the Tsaritsyno rehabilitation center where they appeared before court via video link, the Chinese citizens were still awaiting repatriation. The Chinese detainees include students, businesspeople, and independent travelers. All of them had signed a form when they arrived in Russia agreeing to self-isolate. However, speaking to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper, some of the 80 explained they were simply unaware of the document’s contents and the potential repercussions for breaking the rules. Sign on the Dotted Line Back in 2004, the Russian government published a list of diseases it considered to be “socially significant.” On Jan. 31, Anna Popova, Russia’s chief health officer, added COVID-19 to this list, creating the legal basis for the quarantine consent form which arrivals from China were required to sign. As new cases of the novel coronavirus continued to emerge, Russia announced that starting Feb. 20, it would temporarily suspend the entry of Chinese citizens holding work, visit, student, and travel visas. The following week, it extended the measures to April 1.  A copy of the quarantine consent form obtained by The Paper shows the regulations issued by Popova. Besides requiring everyone entering from China to remain in their residences, arrivals were also ordered to avoid public places, not ride public transport, check their temperatures twice a day, and report their health status daily by phone. The city’s epidemic prevention department also began taking temperatures at places with higher concentrations of Chinese citizens including schools, hotels, and markets. Meanwhile, at subway stations, railway stations, and on public transportation, police carried out checks on Chinese people to ascertain when they had arrived in the country, while also taking body temperature readings. Russian authorities quarantined Chinese deemed a health risk in the Tsaritsyno rehabilitation center, located near the popular Tsaritsyno Palace tourist spot. Several detainees, however, say they had no idea why they were being interned — either because they were unclear about the details on the consent form, or because the police told them they were only being taken for medical tests.  Sisi, the Chinese tourist, said a quarantine officer filled out her consent form for her at the airport, as she didn’t speak or read Russian. “When I arrived at the airport, medical staff showed me where to sign (the form), but they didn’t speak Chinese or English, and I don’t understand Russian,” Sisi told The Paper. “If I’d known I’d have to self-quarantine in my hotel for 14 days, I obviously never would have come.” Hao, a Chinese businessman who works in Russia, encountered a similar situation when he returned to Moscow — signing the document in the belief it was just part of the immigration process. He was picked up by police at a supermarket near his home when stocking up on food. Because he spoke little Russian, he only discovered which rule he’d broken when he arrived at Tsaritsyno for quarantine. “Of course, I’d never have broken the rules if I’d known about them,” he said. “I never imagined it would cost me my work visa.”  Wang Wei, a postgraduate student of economics at a university in Moscow, has been studying in Russia for six years. He spoke enough Russian to get by and abided by the 14-day self-quarantine rule. Since arriving in Moscow on Feb. 5, he sent doctors his health status every day, with another doctor visiting every other day to check his temperature and take a saliva swab. On Feb. 20, with his quarantine over, he collected a certificate proving he was healthy and was told he could start attending class again. However, on Feb. 22, one of Wang’s roommates returned from China and encountered a police officer while taking out the trash. Afterward, the officer brought a doctor to the apartment who tested everyone present. The police then took all five Chinese to Tsaritsyno. “The officer said we were going for medical tests. He said he’d explain my special circumstances, and we’d be back soon enough. It was only after arriving that I discovered we were being put into mandatory quarantine for 14 days.” Wang can’t help but feel he’s been unjustly treated: “I admitted everything, but later it was turned into repatriation.” “No one listened to me,” he added. Situations such as these are not one-of-a-kind, nor are they specific to Chinese citizens. On Feb. 29, a Russian citizen returned from China. She called the hospital almost two weeks later when she began exhibiting symptoms and was taken away. She only realized she’d signed the form at the airport when asked why she had violated the quarantine. “They later showed me the document I’d signed. It was sloppily written, and in one place the word ‘novel coronavirus’ was even misspelled,” she said. “No one explained the form to me. It’d be even harder to understand if you don’t speak Russian.” Trial by Video The dull quarantine life in Tsaritsyno was soon shattered by a piece of news. On Feb. 27, Hao was taken to a separate room where he was asked to sign and fingerprint a form consenting to his repatriation. After refusing, the next day he was brought before a court via video link with just a judge and interpreter present. The judge imposed a fine of 5,000 rubles ($67) and ordered his deportation with no re-entry for five years. “After I said I disagreed with the verdict, they gave me a note. The interpreter said that if I didn’t agree, I had 10 days to appeal. But I’m in quarantine, and I have no idea how,” said Hao. The same day, Wang Wei also had his video hearing. As so many had refused to sign the repatriation agreement, the signing and fingerprinting was cancelled and replaced with direct trials.  “The judge asked me to state my case, so I tried to explain that I’d already been quarantined for 14 days — but he made me speak through the interpreter,” Wang explained. “Since I understand Russian, I could tell that the interpreter wasn’t fit for translating.” Afterward, the judge spoke for three minutes, but the interpreter simply stated the outcome: a 5,000 ruble fine, deportation, and a five-year ban from returning. With that, the trial was over. Wang was never shown the written verdict, nor did he know where he could appeal. For him, the whole process was “a bit ridiculous.” Over the weekend of Feb. 29 and March 1, video hearings of those quarantined in Tsaritsyno were suspended, but anxiety was rife among the detainees — especially in the social media WeChat group they’d created to discuss their plight with journalists. They were also helpless when false rumors emerged on social media saying the Russian police had used violence to enforce the law and mistreated Chinese citizens. One of those quarantined in the rehabilitation center wrote on microblogging site Weibo: “It’s not the 80 Chinese citizens quarantined in Tsaritsyno who are spreading rumors. But the thing is, some people online just assume that it must be us.”  On March 1, the Chinese Embassy in Moscow sent a diplomatic note to the city government clarifying the matter. It explained that the embassy had investigated the posts on social media and found them to be unfounded, adding that those detained by the police were “suspected of violating Russia's epidemic prevention regulations.” The embassy later concluded the rumors were started by the same person who had previously made false claims about the Russian authorities and the novel coronavirus. “To be honest, the quarantine was fine. The food was bad, but no one complained,” explained Wang. “The point is, everyone feels that the punishment is unfair.”  According to the court’s ruling, without an appeal, the detainees will be deported. Upon receipt of the court’s judgment, they are to wait in a special detention center before being repatriated. Lawyers will be permitted to meet them after receiving approval from the center’s manager. “The conditions in the detention center are worse than at Tsaritsyno,” said Sisi. “There are guards outside the rooms, and we’re often fed mashed potatoes and congee. It makes me feel like I’m in a fitness camp.” On March 5, the Chinese Embassy in Russia stated that an appeal by some of the Chinese citizens had been rejected by the Moscow municipal court, but they still had the right to continue appealing. It added that they were working with the Moscow municipal government through diplomatic channels, providing the detainees with the necessary consular protection and legal aid to safeguard their legitimate rights. With four of the detainees already back in China, it remains to be seen when the others will join them.

Pandemic Gives China’s Unmanned Shops New Lease on Life,"Automated convenience stores largely disappeared in China after their novelty wore off. Because of the coronavirus, they may be getting a second chance.",2020-03-12,"With the COVID-19 pandemic posing unprecedented challenges for virtually all industries in China, unmanned convenience stores — once a fleeting fad — are getting a second chance. But while improved technologies may be able to provide satisfactory shopping experiences, it’s too early to be thinking of unmanned retail as the wave of the future, experts say. In an effort to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, health authorities in China have been encouraging people to avoid all nonessential human interaction. Offline shopping has thus become risky business for both customers and clerks. Suning.com, a Nanjing-based retailer that operates online and offline, decided in early February to turn all 12 of its smart convenience stores into 24/7 unmanned operations. Since early 2019, these stores scattered across several Chineses cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Nanjing, were operated by human clerks during the day and by no one at all overnight. To enter the smart Suning stores, customers scan a QR code at the door. Then at checkout, they load their items onto a smart payment station, which scans a special tag on each individual item and calculates the total cost. Customers can pay using a mobile payment app such as WeChat. Xu Hongping, who oversees development for Suning’s smart retail stores, told Sixth Tone that, apart from monitoring the company’s 24/7 customer service platform, human workers are only needed to restock the stores’ shelves each morning. “We didn’t digitize our stores solely to make them autonomous and try to sell them on that,” Xu said. “During the outbreak, their capacity to run autonomously has coincided with the need to minimize human interaction. And on normal days, these technologies help us increase efficiency. For example, we can reduce the number of people working in the store, and this also makes inventory-checking easier.” Unmanned stores first took off in China in late 2016, when a flurry of domestic tech firms — mostly startups — joined the rush to open cashierless convenience stores. By the end of 2017, over 138 companies had opened some 200 unmanned shops in China, according to domestic media. Collectively, they raised a total of 4 billion yuan ($573 million) in investment. But the boom was short-lived, as the stores failed to attract enough customers once the novelty wore off. Since the beginning of 2018, many startups shut down their businesses. For example, GoGo Xiaochao, a Chengdu-based firm, closed all of its stores in February of that year, after just four months. “At the time, they (these retailers) were focusing too much on the idea of ‘unmanned’ and overlooked customers’ needs for good service,” said Rosie Zhang, co-founder of Shanghai-based retail technology firm Cloudpick, whose clients include Suning. Many of these first-generation unmanned stores didn’t carry perishables like bento boxes, which are among the most popular items at Chinese convenience stores. “If the user experience is bad, customers won’t come back,” Zhang told Sixth Tone. Cloudpick has designed a system that creates a “Grab & Go, senseless payment” shopping experience using artificial intelligence, according to the company’s website. In stores equipped with Cloudpick’s technology, customers are tracked by ceiling cameras as they shop for items. The computerized system then adds the selected items into a virtual shopping cart attached to individual customers. There’s no need to wait for checkout: Instead, customers simply walk out of the store, with the system charging their previously linked bank card or mobile payment account the corresponding amount. Moreover, the system can process dozens of shoppers simultaneously.  The COVID-19 outbreak may be an unexpected boon to these smart stores. “When a new technology comes along, it’s only natural for people to have doubts about it. The need to avoid contact as much as possible has really prompted people to try out these stores. If they have a good experience the first time, they’re likely to come back after the outbreak subsides,” Zhang said. So far, Suning’s 12 smart stores are not yet equipped with Cloudpick’s “senseless payment” technology, but the retail giant has set up two experimental “Grab & Go” stores in Nanjing. According to Xu, Suning is planning to open additional senseless payment stores this year. “We know exactly which items are popular and which are not. We know what and how much to restock. We also know which spots on the shelves attract more customers,” Xu said, citing big data collected by the shops’ AI systems. But experts are skeptical about whether robots can become the future of retail. Kathleen Richardson, a robot ethicist at De Montfort University in the U.K., told Sixth Tone that machines have fixed parameters for how things work, and thus are not flexible enough to satisfy people’s diverse needs, such as purchasing adult products or other age-restricted items. “I think it will be fun at first for most people, a novelty, but then it will quickly become boring,” she said. “ If you think about the marketplace, for thousands of years it was where people exchanged, bartered, and coexisted. I suspect people might feel unsafe in them (unmanned stores) because they will turn shops into graveyards, with only one or two living beings around.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005299
How COVID-19 Changed the Conversation About Chinese Journalism,The pandemic has given a shot in the arm to an industry in crisis.,2020-03-12,"On Feb. 26, Caixin, a Chinese media outlet with a well-earned reputation for high-quality reporting, published an in-depth investigative report on the Chinese researchers who had identified key warning signs of the current pandemic as early as December 2019 — only to watch as their work was flushed down a bureaucratic black hole for weeks. That same week, another prominent Chinese news outlet, Caijing, published an exclusive exposé of its own, detailing how local officials had allegedly obstructed the work of a national investigation team sent to the emerging outbreak’s epicenter in early January. The article’s sources did not mince words, outright accusing their local interlocutors of “lying.” The piece was viewed millions of times on social networking platforms like Weibo and WeChat. The past few years have been a trying time for China’s journalism industry. As a teacher at a journalism school, I’ve seen firsthand how these trends have caused my students to question their professional futures, but I also believe the current crisis proves there’s still room for real reporting in our society. The ongoing spread of COVID-19, which the WHO March 11 declared a pandemic, has ironically offered a sort of proof-of-life for several once-prominent Chinese media companies. According to one analysis, since Jan. 20, a total of 13 market-oriented outlets have sent journalists to the central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first reported late last year. Although Caixin has arguably gotten the most attention, a number of other respected but long-torpid publications, including China Newsweek and Sanlian Life Week, have also published detailed, hard-hitting reports from Wuhan. They’ve covered everything from residents going untreated as hospitals struggled to cope with a deluge of patients to malfeasance and incompetence at a local Red Cross Society of China branch. These outlets’ outstanding performances have given a needed boost to the country’s traditional media industry. At the turn of the 21st century, journalism — especially investigative journalism — was both a haven for idealism and a lucrative pursuit. Those days are long gone, in part thanks to regulations as well as competition from digital outlets. Public reactions to the journalistic work being done in Wuhan, however, offers new hope for outlets willing to conduct in-depth reporting. Take Caixin, for example. Although it removed its paywall for reports linked to the pandemic, readers have found other ways to support the company. When its weekly print magazine published the first two parts of a three-issue series on the pandemic and response efforts, they sold out almost immediately, and the company quickly announced plans for a secondary print run. Anecdotally, several members of chat groups I’m in have purchased every print issue that Caixin and Sanlian Life Week have published about the crisis, partly for historical purposes and partly to memorialize those who’ve died. Meanwhile, from my vantage point within academia, the recent performance of China’s journalism industry offers a vociferous rejoinder to doubts about the importance of reporting in the “post-truth era.” Chinese students and scholars of journalism are suffering from an identity crisis. What’s the use of upholding professional standards such as fact-based reporting and objectivity when all audiences seem to want is sensational content that reinforces their preexisting notions about the world? I’ve lost track of how many debates I’ve witnessed at conferences, seminars, and forums over the value and viability of professional journalism: Is it still necessary? Will it be replaced by social media or citizen journalism? Can the industry even survive? These anxieties are not unique to China: Together, they comprise what I like to call the “post-truth syndrome.” But the debate has added significance in China, where only media organizations certified by the state are authorized to report on issues of social or political importance. Done right, grassroots WeMedia outlets can play a useful role in keeping the public informed, but they lack certifications, as well as access to the kinds of authoritative sources open to professional journalists. This ultimately limits their usefulness in times of crisis. We face a century likely to be filled with uncertainty and risk, whether natural or man-made. To meet them, we need to cultivate dedicated, professional media organizations capable of carrying out challenging investigative reporting under difficult circumstances. That doesn’t mean social media and citizen journalists don’t have a role to play, but if grassroots journalists are the foot soldiers of the future journalism industry, outlets like Caixin are the special operations forces. Training these troops should be the primary goal of journalism education. A competent journalist must be equipped to sniff out useful information from a variety of sources, have the sensitivity to navigate China’s challenging political and regulatory environment, and ferret out the truth based on conflicting, entangled narratives. This cannot be achieved through courage and passion alone. It takes tedious and repeated practice, ideally in an educational environment, where practitioners can get guidance from experienced teachers. In a previous piece, I wrote: “The value of journalism is not fading, even though traditional media seems to be deteriorating. Decline also foreshadows revival, and in my journalism class, I’ll do my utmost to prepare them (my students) for its future renaissance.” Last year, for example, I organized a new student group at my university to assess various media outlets on the basis of diversity, balance, transparency, and logical coherence. At the time, a friend of mine joked that quality no longer mattered in journalism — all that counted was clicks. I’d like to think that the events of the past month definitively show that is not the case.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005270
How COVID-19 Sparked a Silver Tech Revolution in China,"After cities across China went into lockdown, millions of elderly Chinese turned to mobile apps for food delivery and entertainment. But will they continue using them after the pandemic is over?",2020-03-12,"SHANGHAI — Two months ago, Xu Wenyan didn’t even have a data plan on her phone. Now, the 62-year-old spends most of her day online. Each morning, Xu orders groceries using a mobile app. Then, she listens to the news on her phone while cooking. Afternoons are for sharing photos of her freshly prepared dishes with her friends. After dinner, she and her husband often play around with a karaoke app, waiting eagerly for other users to comment on their performances. Like millions of elderly Chinese, the spread of the novel coronavirus has forced Xu to embrace the digital world. As the country struggled to contain the virus, the markets, stores, and parks that she frequented in central Shanghai suddenly shut down — leaving her feeling helpless. “I was really upset at first,” Xu tells Sixth Tone. “I didn’t even know how to deal with the meals, let alone find alternatives for other leisure activities.”  Though China’s cities are now slowly coming back to life, the country’s tech firms are hoping the lockdowns will prove to be a game changer, opening up a huge tranche of new users that were previously out-of-reach. China has around 250 million people over 60, and this figure is expected to surpass 480 million by the middle of the century. In Shanghai, over one-third of residents are aged over 60. In the past, Chinese seniors were far less likely to use digital services than younger generations. According to data released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2018, some 60% of people over 50 watch videos on their smartphones and just over half have used digital payment methods like Alipay and WeChat Pay. Around one-third of the group use navigation and online shopping apps, while only one-quarter use ride-hailing services. But internet companies have reported a surge in business from elderly users since the outbreak began, according to Duan Mingjie, founder of AgeClub, a consulting firm that advises brands on how to target older-age customers. “Many of our clients have witnessed significant growth in (elderly) users and sales of some of their paid services have increased 50%-80%,” says Duan. “The quarantines have encouraged the aging population to use apps to meet various needs in life.”  The biggest beneficiaries have been online grocery companies. Customers have turned to delivery services in droves to avoid visiting crowded supermarkets — or because they have been banned from leaving their residential compounds, as has happened in several virus-stricken areas. During Spring Festival — when China was uncovering hundreds of new infections each day — Alibaba’s online supermarket Hema reported that orders were up 220% year-over-year. Sales for competitors Miss Fresh and JD.com’s online grocery platform, meanwhile, were up 350% and 470% during the same period, respectively. New business from elderly users appeared to account for a significant chunk of these increases. According to Alibaba, the number of grocery orders placed by users born in the ’60s was four times higher than normal during Spring Festival. Miss Fresh claims its number of users aged over 40 has risen by 237% during the pandemic. Xu and her husband started using grocery-ordering apps in late January. There’s a wet market just a 10-minute walk from the couple’s home, and Xu says she enjoys shopping there. But she became reluctant to go due to the shortage of face masks in Shanghai. “My daughter has been trying to talk me into buying groceries using apps for over a year, and now I’m finally open to it,” says Xu.  The couple downloaded five apps on their daughter’s recommendation. Initially, however, the services didn’t turn out to be as convenient as they’d expected. The massive number of orders being placed, combined with the shortage of delivery drivers during Spring Festival, made it difficult for Xu to get the goods she wanted. “I set an alarm to place orders for each app in the morning,” says Xu. The earliest would go off at 4:30 a.m. “I could mostly get what I wanted,” she adds. “I even sent some stuff to my daughter, as she couldn’t get up that early.” Before the pandemic, Xu estimates, less than 10% of her friends had tried buying groceries online. Now, she says, nearly all of them have experimented with it. On the messaging app WeChat, her contacts are continually sending each other links to new items on the apps and tips on how to get good discounts. The elderly have turned to tech to meet other needs, too. Chen Xianhua, a retired accountant from Shanghai, tells Sixth Tone she’s been ordering medicine and consulting doctors via health apps during the crisis. Meituan, one of the country’s largest delivery platforms, reported orders for medication related to chronic diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis increased by over 200% during Spring Festival. Chen and her husband have also become big fans of the short video platforms TikTok and Kuaishou, which they downloaded for the first time in February. Chen says they mainly watch funny skits, videos of cute dogs, and livestreams of shows on the apps, as well as news about the pandemic.  “The whole social atmosphere is quite depressing at the moment — we need to keep our sense of humor,” says Chen. “Without these apps, I don’t know how my husband and I would ever stay optimistic.” For the tech giants, the question is whether their new silver-haired users will stick around after the pandemic subsides. Several of them have already laid out strategies to target the elderly, judging it to be a growth market. Miss Fresh has announced plans to roll out new services and product categories for older consumers, after seeing the potential in the market over recent weeks. Alibaba has already started down this path, launching a special senior-friendly version of its Taobao shopping app in 2018. Chen, who first tried ordering groceries online six months ago, says she still prefers going to the wet market herself, because she enjoys chatting with her neighbors and bargaining with the vendors. But she’s come to value the apps, especially when it’s raining or she’s feeling tired.  “At first, I had concerns,” says Chen. “But then I found the vegetables I ordered online to be just as fresh as the ones I personally pick in the market … The app offers me an alternative.” The 65-year-old has also gotten hooked on some of the app’s extra features, such as the “what to eat and cook” section, which suggests new recipes to try. She’s even started posting her own recipes on another cookery app she recently downloaded, as she enjoys reading the comments posted by other users. “I’m keen on being active online, because I don’t want to be behind the times,” says Chen. AgeClub founder Duan says elderly consumers often describe going through a similar shift in mindset during his company’s focus groups. “This pandemic will have a significant impact, as it’ll make many elderly people who didn’t previously use the internet form new online consumption habits,” says Duan. “Once elderly users get used to the internet, they find there is far greater choice online.” Xu is no longer getting up before dawn to secure a delivery slot, but she still enjoys surprising her daughter with her newfound tech savvy. “My daughter said it had never occurred to her that one day I’d be ordering vegetables for her online,” she says. “It makes me feel useful and up-to-date.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005303
Civic Groups Want to Help Fight COVID-19. So Why’s It So Hard?,Chinese social organizations have played important roles in past disaster relief efforts. Why were officials less receptive this time?,2020-03-11,"This Lunar New Year’s Eve wasn’t a particularly festive occasion. Although the annual televised Spring Festival Gala was as extravagant as ever, many people I know spent the night glued to their phones, swiping through a seemingly endless stream of photos and videos emanating from the central city of Wuhan: exhausted medical staff, overcrowded hospitals, and desperate patients begging for help. That night, Chinese all around the world banded together to form volunteer groups dedicated to fighting the COVID-19 epidemic. In the weeks since, a number of people have told me they had never in their lives felt so urgently needed by their country. Many found it unbearable to stand by and watch. Unofficial and grassroots voluntary organizations have been a critical component of China’s disaster relief and reconstruction efforts for years. Over the past few weeks, these groups have been celebrated for rushing urgent supplies and assistance to areas in need — often faster than some more slow-footed official aid distribution channels. Yet, perhaps because of the unique dimensions of the current crisis, not everyone has welcomed their efforts. Especially in the early days, there was noticeably less cooperation between the state and grassroots groups than during past disasters. Instead of proactively working with civil groups to fill gaps in response efforts, some local governments preferred to go it alone. To understand why, it helps to know a little about the recent history of post-disaster state-society cooperation in China. The year 2008 is generally seen as a turning point for Chinese civil society, in part because of the crucial role social forces played in rescue and reconstruction work after the devastating Wenchuan earthquake in the southwestern Sichuan province that May. In the ensuing years, the country gradually seemed to recognize that the government cannot always handle everything on its own, and the state began cooperating more closely with social organizations — at least when it came to disaster response. This was especially true in Sichuan, which experiences frequent earthquakes. After the 2013 Ya’an earthquake, officials in the province set up a center to coordinate grassroots groups and sought to bridge the gap between the government’s requirements and social organizations’ proposals. It also marked the first time that the national Ministry of Civil Affairs loosened rules requiring donations to be channeled through officially sanctioned groups, giving donors greater choice in where to allocate their resources. By 2018, there were 817,000 registered social organizations in China, up from 266,000 at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2003. Many of these have now been operating for years, and organizers have cited their past experiences working in disaster rescue and reconstruction efforts elsewhere as a key reason for their quick responses this time. Zhang, a 38-year-old Wuhan resident and member of a local driving club, told me he first got involved in social relief work after the Wenchuan earthquake and has spent much of the past decade helping organize rescues of stranded drivers. So when the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in his city, he had a firm idea of what was both needed and feasible given his resources. Mobilizing 200 members of his car club to provide rides to doctors and nurses, he set up a headquarters in a car dealership, established a management and registration system to arrange rides, and began offering disease prevention training. Zhang’s experience isn’t unique. As the virus spread, other volunteer networks responded by offering psychological counseling services online — long before the national health authorities acknowledged the need for them. Organizers didn’t have to wait for the official go-ahead: They knew from past disaster relief efforts the risks posed by stress and anxiety. Compared with their state-affiliated counterparts, voluntary organizations tend to be more flexible and sensitive to unique or minority needs. Aid distributed through official channels is generally allocated from top to bottom, with big cities and top hospitals receiving priority. As a result, staff at second- and third-tier hospitals — not to mention those in smaller towns — are often left scrambling for supplies, even though they are also at high risk of infection. Other important but lower-priority causes, like providing protective gear to funeral homes or hygienic products to female doctors on the front line, have an even harder time getting state attention and often go unresolved. This leaves grassroots groups to fill in the gap. But with cities sealed off and traffic links cut, transporting aid requires close collaboration. The fact that members have managed to successfully cooperate is a testament to their high levels of mutual trust. For example, alumni groups have played a significant role in the current crisis, in part because the members buying and shipping goods to hard-hit areas trust those in charge of distribution to make sure the aid gets where it’s needed. This stands in stark contrast to, say, public faith in many state-affiliated charities, some of which have been battered by scandals in recent years. Yet, in a step backward from Ya’an, officials initially required all donations to be routed through one of five nationally designated charity organizations. In a few areas, these charities simply requisitioned supplies collected by civic groups. One potential reason for the state’s frosty reception of grassroots aid is the fact that the current crisis is still unfolding — and there remains a real risk of infection. Previous examples of successful state-civil cooperation have generally come after the disaster was over. To further complicate matters, natural disaster relief efforts are generally led by local or national civil affairs departments, which are used to dealing with civil society groups. The public health authorities are far less familiar with this kind of cooperation. In a February article, Zhang Qiang, a risk analyst at Beijing Normal University, noted that the country’s public health emergency response system was clearly less practiced at collaborating with social forces. “Public health emergency response systems are not just a government matter; they should engage all citizens,” Zhang wrote. Over the past three months, the state has also shown a clear preference for unified, centralized logistics. Such methods fit with the seemingly resurgent belief that a centralized state is best positioned to manage emerging problems. But the state cannot manage everything on its own. The inefficiency of official channels was widely criticized in the early days of the crisis, as Wuhan struggled to get the virus under control. In particular, the five officially designated donation channels came under fire for how long they took to get donated medical protective gear to hospitals. This has since led some local officials and state organs at the outbreak’s epicenter to start forging closer links to volunteer groups. In Wuhan, the officially designated Hubei Charity Federation has been working with unofficial driver organizations since mid-February to distribute protective materials, in part because they are more efficient. And Huanggang, a small city that is among the hardest-hit areas in the country, is collaborating with an online volunteer group to provide residents and patients with psychological counseling and medical advice. The services provided by volunteer and grassroots groups are often imperfect. But in the initial absence of an effective and quick official response, these organizations have played a key role in meeting residents’ needs and allocating aid — thereby helping keep the crisis from spiraling out of control. The government should recognize social forces’ value, and do what’s necessary to encourage, utilize, and cooperate with them.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005212
Tough Sell: China’s Agents Shill Homes via Livestream Amid Epidemic,"With sellers reluctant to let strangers into their homes during the epidemic, real estate companies are getting creative.",2020-03-11,"SHANGHAI — In a brightly lit real estate office, Ma Xijin is loudly explaining the many benefits of a property in up-and-coming Yangpu District. He’s doing so, however, in an empty room. The real estate manager is talking to a group of buyers via livestream — a growing trend in China as agents do anything they can to ride out the COVID-19 epidemic. Ma has been encouraging his sales team at Yudaoo Properties to try out new marketing ideas during the crisis. He has been a fan of livestreaming for a while — often enjoying streams of mukbang stars eating vast quantities of food — and thought the medium could work for real estate, too. “In some ways, the epidemic has forced us to give it a try,” said Ma, a 13-year veteran in the industry.    The real estate industry has been rocked by the epidemic. In large cities like Shanghai, home sellers have become reluctant to allow strangers to enter their homes. Buyers have also postponed plans to invest, as the government has been encouraging people to stay indoors. Restrictions for entering or leaving many apartment compounds, meanwhile, have made it even harder for agents to schedule viewings. “Before the outbreak, we’d arrange 40 groups of clients per day on average to view the apartments they like,” said Zhang Shuai, another manager at Yudaoo. “But now, that number has dropped to single digits.” Real estate companies are trying all sorts of online marketing tactics to stay afloat, encouraging employees to communicate with clients on social media, conduct online training classes, film short videos, and host livestreams. Selling properties online, however, can be a hard sell. Customers are more wary about making such a large purchase through the internet. According to Zhang, Yudaoo’s managers don’t really expect livestreaming to produce a high turnover rate for now. Instead, it’s more useful as a marketing tool. “It does save our time and energy,” he said. It remains to be seen whether digitally selling homes can become a long-term trend. Zhang’s just looking forward to the day when his team can all take off their masks.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005296
Why COVID-19 Is Getting the TCM Treatment,"China’s medical system is far more advanced than it was 50 years ago, so why are herbal remedies still a go-to cure?",2020-03-10,"On Jan. 31, the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported an important discovery in the battle against COVID-19: Preliminary research by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and the Wuhan Institute of Virology had found that Shuanghuanglian, a traditional Chinese medicine, could “inhibit” the novel coronavirus. The apparent breakthrough, which was quickly hailed by the state-run Xinhua News Agency, sent people around the country dashing off to their local pharmacies for a chance to stock up on the drug. Only, there was — and still is — no conclusive evidence Shuanghuanglian can actually inhibit COVID-19 infections. The next day, experts and some state media outlets tried to dial back the report, warning that Shuanghuanglian’s effectiveness against COVID-19 had yet to be substantiated. Their fact checks didn’t reach everyone in time, however. On Feb. 14, a patient in the central city of Zhengzhou was diagnosed with the disease. They had left their home only once in the 10 days prior to falling sick — to visit the pharmacy to buy Shuanghuanglian. TCM is widely accepted by the Chinese public and enjoys a strong social and official cachet, so it’s no surprise that it’d be used heavily during the current epidemic. Last week the World Health Organization took “traditional herbal remedies” off its list of ineffective and potentially harmful treatment measures, explaining that many people may turn to herbal drugs “to alleviate some of the milder symptoms of COVID-19.” Yet it’s worth asking why, in a modern country with access to advanced medicine and equipment, so many people would put their faith in a drug primarily composed of honeysuckle, Chinese skullcap, and forsythia. TCM has long been promoted for epidemic control in China. In 1988, Shanghai experienced an outbreak of hepatitis A that eventually infected around 300,000 residents. Growing up in a small nearby city, I still remember people rushing out to buy Banlangen, a traditional cold remedy that the Shanghai health authorities said could prevent and treat the disease. In Shanghai, it briefly became fashionable to serve a cup of hot Banlangen to guests. Banlangen experienced a renewed burst of popularity in 2003, when an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome swept the country, and again in 2013 — this time along with Shuanghuanglian — during a bird flu outbreak. Even as early as Jan. 1 this year, when the novel coronavirus was still largely being treated as a rumor, my friends and family were already musing about stocking up on Banlangen again. The continued widespread prescription of herbal remedies by medical professionals in China is to an extent a legacy of the nascent years of the People’s Republic of China. In the early 1950s, the country promoted the so-called integration of Chinese and Western medicine as a way to supplement its scarce medical resources. The movement gained steam in the 1960s, when the country began training “barefoot doctors” to provide basic medical services to rural areas. This group was given a crash course in modern diagnostics, including theories of internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics, but they were also schooled in the “one needle, one herb” theory of TCM, which was viewed as an important complement to modern medicine. A manual for barefoot doctors, published in Shanghai in 1970, recommended Banlangen and the main ingredients of Shuanghuanglian as effective “heat-clearing” drugs and listed them as potential prophylactics for common infectious diseases, including influenza and Japanese encephalitis. Widely cultivated and easily manufactured at a time of economic scarcity, these herbs helped compensate for a lack of access to modern alternatives. As for their popularity today, this can be partly attributed to culturally ingrained beliefs about the nature of herbal medicines. Historically, the line between TCM and diets has been blurred, and it remains common for people to view TCM remedies as something that can be consumed safely on a daily basis. The underlying idea is simple: By regulating the body’s balance before falling ill, one can improve one’s natural resistance — it’s a sort of folk version of medical immunity. Although some traditional remedies, such as malaria treatment artemisinin, have been adapted for use by the broader medical community, most Chinese herbal therapies have yet to be tested or proven in a laboratory or clinical setting. Their toxicity and potential side effects are often unclear, and a number of manufacturers have been accused of using poisonous or even carcinogenic materials. Yet many Chinese continue to believe that, because they are made from natural ingredients, they pose no risk.  Setting aside its physical properties, the popularity and widespread acceptance of TCM can sometimes endow it with unforeseen value in epidemic situations. In 1988, Shanghai experienced an outbreak of hepatitis A. As a “self-limited” disease, there is no effective medication for hepatitis A, meaning doctors can only care for patients and make them as comfortable as possible while their bodies fight off the infection.  Xie Lijuan, a former doctor who was then serving as Shanghai’s vice mayor, knew this, but she still believed TCM could help. In a recent interview, she recalled how the city developed and issued a heat clearing TCM concoction: “The patients would feel that they were receiving treatment and be reassured and comforted.” The choice of medicine wasn’t random. “According to TCM theory, heat clearing drugs are to a certain extent beneficial in treating hepatitis A,” she noted. COVID-19 also has no known cure or proven treatment regimen. On Feb. 14, Huang Luqi, a medical expert with the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, stated: “The common people have an urgent need for TCM, and their anxiety has been relieved to some extent after taking it.” Nevertheless, we must be careful not to go overboard. In addition to the above-mentioned Shuanghuanlian incident, earlier this month, students in the southwestern city of Lincang complained they were being required to consume a supposedly medicinal soup before they were allowed back on campus, though city officials quickly backed down. Given the stakes, it’s important to be cautious, hold all prospective treatments to strict scientific and clinical standards, and put the protection of human life above all else.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005269
"Abused and Stressed, China’s Community Workers Seek Help",They’re considered China’s first line of defense against the COVID-19 epidemic. But many are on the verge of burnout.,2020-03-10,"In her dreams, Liu Xuqing screams at her neighbors. Night after night, she berates them for skipping quarantine, failing to wear a mask, and breaking a host of other rules designed to contain the spread of COVID-19. “One morning, my daughter told me I’d been yelling, ‘I told you not to leave the building — get back inside!’ in my sleep,” says Liu. “I realized that, since I can’t take it (my frustrations) out on anyone during the day, I vent in my dreams.” The 40-year-old has had insomnia and stress for weeks after being tasked with enforcing China’s strict disease control measures in the Huanggu neighborhood — a cluster of residential buildings in the northern city of Shenyang. As the head of Huanggu’s residential committee, Liu is responsible for monitoring over 10,000 residents: checking their temperatures, logging when they enter and leave the compound, and ensuring those ordered to isolate themselves at home stay indoors, among other duties.  Residential committees, or ju wei hui, are the backbone of China’s local governance system, helping to implement policies on everything from family planning to trash sorting in neighborhoods across the country. Since late January, they’ve also become the foot soldiers in the government’s war on COVID-19. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called residential committees the country’s first and most important “line of defense” against the virus. But experts warn that many residential committee members like Liu are showing signs of burnout, as long hours and constant pressure over a prolonged period take their toll on the workers’ mental health. Liu has been working 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week for nearly two months. “It’s exhausting,” she says. “I don’t necessarily get off work after I get home. I’m on call 24 hours a day in case there’s an emergency.”  The job is made more stressful by many residents’ resentment toward the anti-epidemic rules. Conflicts often punctuate Liu’s days, as her neighbors’ frustrations boil over. “We’ve been yelled at by residents when we tell them not to park in the no-parking zone … we argue with people who refuse to wear masks and who insist on leaving without permission,” says Liu. “Everyone is frustrated by the epidemic.” None of these arguments have escalated beyond shouting, but in other parts of China confrontations between committee members and residents have become physical. In Taiyuan, a city in central China, a man kicked over a bike and hit committee workers with a bottle of disinfectant after a disagreement. In Dalian, a city 400 kilometers south of Shenyang, a resident was filmed dumping a bag full of dog feces onto a table used by residential workers. The most frequent source of contention is committees’ efforts to enforce quarantine rules. By law, anyone returning from high-risk areas such as Wuhan or Wenzhou must stay inside their homes or a designated hotel for 14 days, but Liu says several people have tried to sneak in and out of their apartments without being noticed. “Not everyone is willing to be locked in a hotel, so some people lie,” says Liu. “We have to listen to the noise (inside their apartments) and ask their neighbors, just to figure out if they’re telling the truth.”  Liaoning province, where Shenyang is located, has logged only 125 reported COVID-19 infections and one death as of Monday — none of which came from Huanggu. But Shenyang has been under renewed pressure in recent days due to the surge in cases reported in South Korea — just a two-hour flight away. Liu’s team has been ordered to call each of Huanggu’s roughly 4,700 households to ensure no one has recently traveled to the country, a process that takes two weeks of intense work to complete. “So far, we haven’t had many residents coming back from Korea or other hard-hit areas, but that doesn’t mean we can slack off, because you never know,” says Liu. The stress of managing the enormous workload — not to mention the fear of catching the virus — often gives Liu sleepless nights. She’s far from the only one. Mental health charities have reported a spike in the number of residential committee staff members seeking counseling in recent weeks. “We’ve seen a surge in calls from community workers since early February,” says Zhang Gaoyang, a volunteer at Shiyu Xinli, a counseling hotline in Shenyang. “They’re on the front lines of disease containment … Moreover, they may have family members who are more vulnerable. Community workers often tell us they’re in close contact with many people at work, and they worry they’ll pass on the virus to their family.”  Wu Kankan, a post-disaster mental health expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says residential committee workers are particularly vulnerable, as they’re required to take care of others rather than put their own mental health first. “They’re at risk of job burnout and need active psychological intervention, but the services aren’t always available,” says Wu. “They simply might not have the time to reach out for help.” Studies have shown that job burnout, especially in a trauma setting like a disease outbreak, can lead to emotional exhaustion, reduced feelings of personal accomplishment — the feeling that everything one does is useless — and negative attitudes toward work. Chinese authorities appear to be aware of the severity of the situation. On March 3, the central government ordered local officials to introduce a series of measures to support residential committee staff, including ensuring community workers get more days off. Many local governments and other organizations have set up free mental health services since the start of the epidemic, with 440 new hotlines launched by mid-February, according to the State Council, China’s Cabinet.  Xu Xinyue, a counselor based in Beijing, volunteers at a new hotline set up by Wu and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Residential committee workers aren’t the most common callers, but their difficulties tend to be more serious than regular members of the public, she says. “It’s a very dangerous and tough job they’re doing,” Xu tells Sixth Tone. “I’ve heard many stories of community workers being unfairly criticized or blamed by residents for things they didn’t or can’t do. But I haven’t seen one case in which community workers fought back.” According to Xu, the buildup of negative feelings such as anger and frustration can become a source of anxiety, and so it’s helpful for community workers to talk. “Some of them say they’re sad that they haven’t gotten to hold their kids for over a month, and they don’t know when this (the epidemic) will end,” says Xu. “But deep down, they’re letting out all their suppressed emotions.” Zhang, the Shenyang-based counselor, says exhaustion and insomnia are common symptoms among the residential committee workers with whom she has spoken. “We tell them what they’re experiencing — fear, anxiety, panic, anger — are all very normal and understandable,” says Zhang. “We also help them look for motives. It’s empowering to remember what you’re fighting for.”  Community workers are less likely than other members of the public to develop long-lasting post-traumatic stress disorder following the epidemic, unless they or their relatives are infected with the virus, according to Wu, the post-trauma mental health expert. Having institutional support helps protect individuals from the condition. “They know they’re part of a bigger organization in this battle, and they know they’re not fighting alone,” says Wu. The main problem is ensuring community workers get access to counseling services — and encouraging them to use them. Though technology has made help more readily available — patients can even book counseling via popular apps WeChat and Alipay, Wu points out — many Chinese are reluctant to turn to counseling.  Less than half of Chinese adults with mental health conditions have made use of a mental health service, according to a 2013 survey. Wu says cultural stigmas around mental health are partly to blame. “It’s embedded in our culture that you’d rather shed blood than tears,” says Wu. “If you mention you went to see a counselor, it’s almost like saying you went to a psychiatric hospital in China.” There are signs, however, that the epidemic is helping change the country’s conversation on mental health. There has been a significant amount of media coverage about mental health services in recent weeks. On Feb. 10, Chen Xuefeng, a psychology expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was invited to discuss mental health issues during a press conference hosted by the State Council. “These are all positive changes that can help de-stigmatize the topic (of mental health),” says Wu. Liu, the Huanggu committee head, called the Shiyu Xinli hotline for the first time a few weeks ago. She says the counselors have given her a space to let out her emotions and suggested practical ways to unwind before bed, such as watching relaxing videos and listening to calming music. She plans to call them again soon, once she has some time off. “The job is very stressful and demanding, but I’m not going to back down, no matter what,” says Liu.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005291
What COVID-19 Has To Do With the Price of Cherries in China,The past month was a rotten time to be in the imported fruit business.,2020-03-09,"I’ve spent the past 16 years working in China’s imported fruit industry, but the past month may have been the hardest I’ve ever been through. The year started optimistically. Imports were up 24% in 2019, and we were preparing for the annual Lunar New Year sales season, when people across the country stock up on fruit to give guests or use in family celebrations. Domestically grown fruits have long been a part of holiday spreads, but in recent years imported items like Chile-grown cherries have become a particularly popular New Year’s gift. Then everything went pear-shaped. On Jan. 20, the government suddenly raised the alarm about a new coronavirus outbreak in the central province of Hubei. The disease, since renamed COVID-19, quickly spread nationwide, killing 3,123 people and sickening almost 80,000 more as of March 8. To combat the epidemic, officials implemented a series of escalating “hardcore” control measures, shutting down roads, closing public places, banning gatherings, and encouraging — or requiring — residents to stay home. These policies posed a hurdle to businesses around the country. My industry is no exception: With Lunar New Year’s parties canceled, people staying indoors, and potential customers generally limiting purchases to essentials such as meat, eggs, and vegetables, consumer demand for relative luxuries like imported fruit has shriveled. Based on my personal observations, cherry retail prices have sunk by about 40% to 50% during what should be their peak sales season. Wholesale imported fruit markets in Shanghai are generally open year-round. Most wholesalers stayed open during the epidemic, though they took preventative measures such as shortening business hours. Yet the number of buyers has dropped by more than 50% in the markets I’ve visited. Compounding the problem: Fruit has a definite shelf life. Imported fruits in particular have to be moved quickly after their long journey across the globe. Tropical fruits can only be kept for about a week after arriving in China; temperate fruits, for about two weeks to a month. Cherries and blueberries, which are usually fast sellers, begin to lose their sheen about a week after their arrival in China. In short, the longer fruit lingers on the shelf, the more likely it will have to be sold off at a loss. And that was bad news for an industry heavily dependent on what had become a paralyzed transportation network. Although the national government has pushed provinces to lift roadblocks and travel restrictions, based on my observations, fewer than half of all drivers have been able to return to work. Many are stuck in their rural hometowns, and those that make it out are often unable to find a landlord willing to rent to nonlocals in their cities of employment. Even those who can work are sometimes turned away at their destination if their officially listed place of residence is in an epidemic-affected area — even if they haven’t returned home in years. Others have been forced to undergo mandatory 14-day quarantines after every stop.  With deliveries held up for weeks, the entire supply chain began showing signs of strain last month. And in imports, problems in one part of the supply chain can reverberate elsewhere. Last year, pork prices skyrocketed in China after an outbreak of African swine fever, leading many companies to buy pork from international suppliers. Late last September, however, the government released some of its strategic pork reserves to get prices back under control. Suddenly, the imported pork that was still on its way to China became more expensive than pork sold domestically. In an attempt to cut their losses, many importers breached their contracts, and containers full of frozen pork began piling up in the country’s ports. These containers have to stay plugged in, lest their contents go bad, but there were so many that subsequent refrigerated imports have since struggled to find available power sources. Although the situation has since somewhat improved, it remains unclear when the country’s logistics industry will return to some semblance of normalcy. In an attempt to limit the damage from all these problems, local and national officials have rolled out a raft of new policies targeting enterprises, including tax breaks and preferential loan treatment, but these are merely Band-Aids over a gaping wound. The goal of a company is to make money, not to minimize losses, and as long as normal operations are disrupted, no amount of targeted relief policies can make businesses whole. Generally speaking, however, sellers remain optimistic, reasoning that the country’s demand will likely continue to grow. In conversations with my international business partners, I’ve tried to reassure them about the future of the Chinese market: consumers may not be buying now, but they remain interested in imported fruit and access to fresh produce year-round. Orders need to be made in advance, however, so it’s all a bit of a gamble. All we can do is hunker down and try to survive the frost.

"In a City Under Lockdown, a Race to Deliver Anti-HIV Drugs","In virus-stricken Wuhan, patients are struggling to access antiviral medication. Volunteer networks have emerged to help them.",2020-03-07,"Chen Sheng counted the white pills that remained in his medicine bottles. The clock was ticking: Within 12 days, he would run out of anti-HIV drugs. His partner’s stock was even more depleted, with just enough left to last one week. The couple, both 53, were diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2018. Doctors warned them to medicate according to a strict regimen or face increased viral loads and drug resistance. And so, aided by smartphone alarms, they take their pills at set moments, undergo regular medical checks, and make sure to order new stock one month in advance. But the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown in Wuhan, the city in central China’s Hubei province where Chen and his partner live, have interrupted their meticulous schedules. With health services preoccupied fighting the epidemic — which has sickened more than 80,000 patients and killed over 3,000 in China as of Thursday — thousands of Wuhanese who rely on medication to stay healthy are locked inside their residential compounds while they watch their supplies dwindle.  As early as Jan. 26, three days after Wuhan went into lockdown, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) released a notice requiring local China CDCs and HIV service providers to guarantee people’s access to anti-HIV drugs. Nevertheless, nearly one-third of HIV-positive people in China still said restrictions on movement were affecting their HIV treatments, according to a survey among over 1,000 such people by United Nations AIDS agency released in February. When Chen’s supplies began to run low, he looked into what it would take to reach the one hospital where he and his partner can pick up their medication. To get an exit pass necessary to leave his residential compound, he would have needed a certificate from his local China CDC stating that he is HIV-positive. But to get to the China CDC and receive such a certificate, he would need an exit pass. If he somehow managed to break out of this bureaucratic Catch-22, he’d still need to make the 35-kilometer journey to the hospital either by foot or by bicycle, as other transportation methods had been suspended. Crucially, the process would inform the people in Chen’s neighborhood that he and his partner live with HIV, something they had planned to keep secret to avoid being stigmatized. Chen’s partner fears being fired by his government-affiliated employer. “I really don’t want to bother the government, the medical staff, or the social workers, because I know they are all busy fighting the epidemic. So I think I can bear all the difficulties caused by the lockdown: I can eat less when we cannot go get groceries, and I can take cold showers when we’re running out of gas. But I can’t stop taking the medicines,” Chen, choking up, tells Sixth Tone in a phone interview. “That will take my life.”  Volunteer Networks Since late January, Huang Haojie, who works at the nongovernmental organization Wuhan LGBT Center, says he’s received hundreds of calls and messages from people like Chen who were in dire need of their prescription drugs. It made him realize how acute the situation was. “As far as I know, many people have already run out of medicine,” he says. The first solution Huang thought of was to connect people living with HIV in Wuhan with those outside of it, allowing people unaffected by lockdowns to share their extra doses. Dozens of people responded, yet Huang realized this was not nearly enough. At the time, Wuhan residents could still move around the city, despite a lack of transportation options, and Huang called on volunteers to give rides to people with HIV so they could pick up their medicine at Jinyintan Hospital, where most HIV-positive people in Wuhan, including Chen, receive their treatment. When MJ, who requested anonymity because of the nature of his volunteer work, drove to meet his first passenger, he remembers feeling nervous. Jinyintan Hospital is also designated to receive COVID-19 patients, and, afraid of infection, he decided to wear three surgical masks.  MJ’s first passenger was quiet, polite, and anxious. The passenger had planned to pay a short visit to Wuhan before the Spring Festival but was now locked in the city, unable to return home. “Because of the coronavirus, we were both vigilant,” MJ recalls his first trip. “I opened the windows during the whole trip, we kept the largest distance between us, and we rarely spoke a word to each other.” MJ was sympathetic to passengers who were late, figuring they were probably trying to get away from their families without telling them why. He made sure never to ask for personal information, knowing passengers would want to stay anonymous. Still, it caught him by surprise when one passenger told him he’d delete his contact information as soon as possible. “At first I felt a little bit strange and offended — ‘is that a big deal?’ But later I sorted it out: everyone has their secrets,” he says.  “To be honest,” MJ says with a pause, “I used to have high-risk sexual behaviors, and (fearing being HIV-positive) I did some medical checks ... So to some extent, I can imagine how helpless and desperate those patients might be.” MJ says. “It’s really, really not easy to live with HIV and that secret.” Such trips quickly became impossible, however. Since mid-February, stricter measures have forbidden Wuhanese from leaving their residential compounds. Instead of chauffeuring, volunteers like MJ — who have secured exit passes — have switched to picking up medicines on people’s behalf, including for Chen and his partner. Armed with stacks of paperwork, they help up to 65 people a day, making trips to the hospital pharmacy before delivering the medicines to the LGBT center’s office, where the medications are collected by one of the few courier companies still operating in Wuhan. While spending more than eight hours a day in Jinyintan, MJ and other volunteers have limited resources to protect themselves — they don’t have enough respirators and rubbing alcohol, let alone protective goggles or suits. They dare not eat the provided free lunches inside the hospital. “I always drive to a place several kilometers away from the hospital, close all the doors and windows, disinfect my hands, and then I can feel relieved enough to have the meal,” MJ says.  Despite the best efforts of volunteers like MJ, many people living with HIV have not been able to receive help, especially those who live in Hubei but outside of Wuhan. Subject to the same restrictions but not the same attention, they have chosen to walk an entire day to pick up their prescriptions, to ask for police assistance, or to simply remain quiet. Calling for help in public, however, can backfire. On Jan. 24, a Weibo microblog user “Makeup Boy Zou Junxi” from Tianmen, a city in Hubei that had also gone into lockdown, wrote that he only had eight days of anti-HIV drugs left. The post worked, but had unintended consequences. To verify the situation, police visited his family and revealed Zou’s status, which he had kept from them. Zou also suffered abusive comments below his post, which he deleted soon after. Same Drug, Different Diseases When Andy Li shared on Weibo that he had 40 boxes of the anti-HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir he was willing to part with, the first person to respond was not someone with HIV, but a doctor in Wuhan whose CT scan had shown signs he had been infected with the novel coronavirus. Gradually, more and more people, including doctors and nurses working with COVID-19 patients, came to him to ask for the tablets that are marketed to treat HIV, but have been found to be effective against the new coronavirus, too. Li, who himself was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2012, developed a social network for sharing anti-HIV drugs in late 2017. But it wasn’t until this year that his network took off, mostly because of the off-patent medicine lopinavir/ritonavir, also known as Kaletra and Aluvia. On Jan. 23, respiratory specialist Wang Guangfa — a medical expert sent to Wuhan for inspection who was infected during his visit — said that lopinavir/ritonavir brought down his fever in one day. Though there is as-yet no cure (or vaccine) for COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir is one of the potential treatment options recommended in the government’s national guidelines.  “For HIV-positive patients, Kaletra is not their only choice,” Li tells Sixth Tone. “Donors share their extra Kaletra pills, because they have alternatives. But for COVID-19 patients, it could be the hope to save their lives.” Li himself stopped taking Keletra four years ago because of the drug’s strong side effects, but sought out supplies abroad so he could gift them to COVID-19 patients. “There’s quite a difference between helping HIV patients and COVID-19 patients,” says Li. “I can tell whether HIV patients need the medicine by a quick chat, and nobody will wrongly take them. But for COVID-19, I have to be more careful.” To make sure the drugs get to the right people, Li will ask for every patient’s medical information and make sure they understand the potential side effects. Also, since the guidelines state that lopinavir/ritonavir is only effective for patients with mild symptoms, Li won’t send the medicine to people whose disease has progressed beyond that. Turning down such requests is heartbreaking, he says.  Some have doubted whether what Li does is helpful, as the drugs have strong side effects but unclear benefits. Recently, doctors at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center published a peer-reviewed paper on treatment outcomes, stating that patients with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment did not recover faster than those who were not given antivirals, while a WHO-backed clinical trial in Wuhan is still underway. Li read the report but decided to continue. “I will strictly follow the national guideline and only stop when lopinavir/ritonavir is removed,” he says. This campaign has allowed Li to get to know more people living with HIV — they are different ages, come from different cities, and work for different industries. “Everybody has their own special lives. HIV/AIDS shouldn’t be the only label to identify them with,” he says. Chen, who received the volunteers’ package of medicines on March 1, holds similar views: “No matter if you’re a COVID-19 patient, a relative of someone who passed away, a regular person, or someone living with a chronic disease like me, we’re all victims of this epidemic.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005281
"Amid COVID-19, China’s Beauticians Make Up for Lost Time Online","With shopping malls almost deserted, cosmetics firms are encouraging staff to shill products via livestream.",2020-03-06,"SHANGHAI — Tang Hui was nervous. So nervous, she didn’t realize she had said, “I’m nervous” six times in the past minute until her colleague pointed it out. The 31-year-old was about to host her first livestream, and she didn’t feel ready. As a spa therapist, she was more used to giving beauty treatments and teaching others to do the same. But Tang had no choice: Her employer had told her performing online was now a part of her job. She took off her coat, took a deep breath, and stepped in front of her phone inside the empty cosmetics store. Tang is one of many Chinese service workers who have suddenly found themselves thrust into the online spotlight amid the COVID-19 epidemic, which has dealt a crushing blow to retailers, hotels, and any other businesses that rely on people leaving their homes. Despite the fact that Shanghai has allowed businesses to reopen since Feb. 10, customers are still avoiding crowded public places. With offline sales tanking, many companies including AHAVA — the cosmetics and beauty firm that employs Tang — have reacted by asking staff to learn to livestream, so they can sell products to customers online. The retrained workers — most of them sales assistants — even get a fancy new job title: yun gui jie, or “cloud beauty advisor.”  The COVID-19 crisis has seen the emergence of many new businesses or job titles starting with “cloud” in China, such as “cloud clubbing,” “cloud workouts,” and “cloud classrooms.” “I think the offline flow of customers will ebb in the future. It’s already a trend, even without the epidemic,” Tang’s colleague Zhou Xiumei, an offline sales manager at AHAVA, told Sixth Tone. “But the epidemic is pushing us to give it a go, to test whether it will work out.” Tang agreed it’s inevitable that more businesses will go online in the future, but said she was uncertain whether she wanted to continue doing livestreaming long-term. The new job, however, does have at least one perk. “The epidemic has made our lives so boring; it’s always a good thing to pick up a new hobby,” said Tang.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005280
Inside the Race for a COVID-19 Cure,Scientists across the world are rushing to develop effective treatments for the novel coronavirus. But how soon can they be on the market?,2020-03-06,"Update: On March 16, China approved its first experimental vaccine targeting COVID-19 for human trials in healthy individuals, state media reported. The vaccine was developed by researchers at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of the People's Liberation Army. The early-stage trial is scheduled to run from March 16 to Dec. 31. In early January, Zhang Linqi started hearing strange reports from the central Chinese province of Hubei. Hospitals in the regional capital, Wuhan, were seeing a spike in pneumonia patients, and doctors were uncertain what was causing it. As one of China’s leading virologists, the news immediately put Zhang on alert. His years of experience told him that a contagious pathogen could be behind the mysterious wave of infections. “I really hoped it wasn’t anything particular,” Zhang, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, tells Sixth Tone. “But then I thought: What if it is?” So when the Chinese government revealed a few days later that the cases in Wuhan were linked to a novel strain of coronavirus — the same family of viruses that can cause SARS — Zhang called his colleague Wang Xinquan, a structural biologist at Tsinghua. They agreed to put aside all their other projects and focus exclusively on the virus.  At the time, the researchers’ decision may have seemed premature — they still had no idea whether the disease was transmissible among humans. But it proved to be a prescient move. “We’re so glad we made that call,” says Zhang. In just three months, COVID-19 has spread from a single Chinese city to every continent in the world except Antarctica, sickening over 95,000 and killing 3,200 globally as of Thursday. Governments have struggled to contain the elusive disease, with some patients showing no symptoms at all. As the number of cases outside China climbs, experts fear the worst-case scenario — a pandemic that recurs seasonally — is now a likely outcome. “In the absence of drastic measures, this will develop into a pandemic,” says Richard Neher, head of research at Biozentrum, the center for molecular life sciences at the University of Basel in Switzerland. “Whether or not we already are in a pandemic is a matter of semantics.” Scientists are racing to find vaccines, drugs, and antibody treatments capable of combatting the virus, which currently has no known cure. Developing, testing, and bringing a new drug to the market can take as long as a decade during normal periods. But researchers like Zhang have moved swiftly since the initial outbreak, sharing data to an unprecedented degree and drawing on technologies unavailable during previous health crises.  Responses to past epidemics were often sluggish. When the Zika virus spread across the Americas during the mid-2010s, the outbreak wasn't detected and reported for nearly a year. After SARS emerged in China in late 2002, it took four months for scientists to sequence the virus’s genome. This time, however, doctors were able to identify SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — within days. By Jan. 10, a team at Shanghai’s Fudan University had sequenced the virus’s whole genome and uploaded the information to a public database — paving the way for other researchers to begin working on possible treatments.  The genome sequence showed that SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells in a similar way to the SARS virus. Its surface is covered with small, spiky protein structures that can bind to a type of human enzyme. Once docked, the virus can unlock the door to human cells, where it multiplies and spreads. For researchers, understanding the virus’s entry mechanism is of vital importance, because the most effective way of treating a viral infection is to create a drug or vaccine that can prevent the virus from binding to human cells. Over the following weeks, teams around the world mapped out the SARS-CoV-2 binding process in minute detail. On Feb. 19, scientists at the University of Texas published 3D models of the virus’s protein spikes in the journal Science, after analyzing it using a cryogenic electron microscope, or cryo-EM, which can analyze molecular structures almost atom-by-atom.  The next day, a team at Westlake University in eastern China’s Zhejiang province published the structure of an RBD-ACE2 complex — a part of the virus’s protein spike bound to the human enzyme. Zhang, Wang, and their colleagues at Tsinghua shared an even more detailed map of the same complex, which they had reconstructed using X-ray crystallography, the same day. In both cases, the researchers shared their findings immediately rather than waiting weeks to publish in a peer-reviewed journal — a trend that has continued throughout the epidemic. According to a Reuters analysis, 60% of the studies published on COVID-19 are preprints, or manuscripts yet to be peer-reviewed. “We wanted to share our results as soon as possible — they can help others find a way to block the binding process with antibodies or drugs,” Wang, the Tsinghua biologist, tells Sixth Tone. “Sharing information promptly is critical during this crisis … To fight the virus, we need to mobilize all our forces.”  The structure maps allowed scientists to begin searching for molecules capable of binding to the virus or enzymes — the essential building blocks for a COVID-19 treatment. First, however, many researchers are testing out existing medications to see if any are effective against SARS-CoV-2. Because it can take years to create and test a new drug from scratch, this could be the quickest way to find a workable treatment. Various antivirals, including the HIV drug lopinavir, have already been tested on COVID-19 patients, but none have shown definitive results so far. “It’s highly unlikely that anything off-the-shelf will have good activity against SARS-CoV-2,” David Ho, a professor at New York’s Columbia University, told an online forum for COVID-19 researchers Feb. 26. “On desperate occasions you have to try, but you have be awfully lucky to find one that works.”  Other teams are combing through giant databases of over 100 billion chemical compounds to identify potential COVID-19 drug candidates. Drug discovery is an immensely complex task. The therapeutic compound has to perfectly fit the drug targets — such as the SARS-CoV-2 protein spikes or human ACE2 enzymes — but these structures can have diameters 200,000 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. “Finding the exact drug molecules in an enormous pool of chemicals is like searching for a habitable planet in a universe,” says Lai Lipeng, co-founder of Massachusetts-based biotechnology firm XtalPi. Lai, however, believes artificial intelligence technology can significantly shorten the drug discovery and development process. XtalPi is using algorithms to trawl through lists of FDA-approved drugs, and it has already identified 38 candidates that could be effective in treating COVID-19. The firm will soon begin testing the drugs’ efficacy and safety on cells and animals, before moving to clinical trials. Research suggests more than 90% of drug candidates that enter clinical trials will fail before reaching the market. “It’s extremely difficult (to find an effective drug), but … we hold the promise of shortening the drug discovery process from three to six years to one to two years,” says Lai.  Researchers have also created potential vaccines against the virus much faster than during previous outbreaks, thanks in part to the extraordinary level of data sharing among teams. PepGene, a Massachusetts-based biotech firm, is working on a SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine — a shot containing synthetic substances designed to trigger a desired immune response and avoid side effects. The company aims to start clinical trials in the second half of 2020. Chen Tenghui, the company’s founder, tells Sixth Tone that messaging app WeChat has played a surprisingly important role in PepGene’s research and development work since the initial outbreak. During normal periods, pharmaceutical companies closely guard their research to maintain a competitive advantage. Since January, however, employees at dozens of cutting-edge firms — including XtalPi, antibody developer HiFiBiO Therapeutics, and immunotherapy designer RootPath — have been comparing notes via specially created WeChat groups.  “These chat groups significantly boost the communication efficiency among researchers,” says Chen. “For example, we get to modify our product designs immediately based on a new study that comes out, or find out about opportunities for collaboration right away.” Many other teams are moving toward clinical trials for their own vaccines. Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Fudan University announced Feb. 27 that they have begun animal testing for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, while a team at the University of Queensland in Australia claims to be preparing for pre-clinical testing of its first vaccine candidate. Moderna, a Massachusetts-based biotech firm, announced Feb. 24 that it had delivered its first batch of experimental vaccine to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The NIH is expected to begin trials in April. Several smaller biotech companies, including Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Novavax, and CureVac, also have vaccines in the pipeline.  Experts predict it will take 12-18 months for the new vaccines to gain approval due to the time required to complete clinical trials. Zhang, the Tsinghua virologist, says China may expedite the process even more. “It’s possible we could have a vaccine in six to nine months,” says Zhang. “But it’s hard to predict, because there are many variables, such as the technologies used, whether we have sufficient ingredients and equipment, and if the government ‘green-channels’ the approval.” Fast-tracking clinical trials can be controversial, as shorter trials give regulators less time to spot potential side effects or other long-term health risks. For Zhang, however, authorities also have to consider the potential benefits of a fast approval process — including protecting frontline health care workers and allaying public fears over the virus. “Most of the time, vaccines are safe, because the technology has become quite mature,” says Zhang. “Certainly, there may be long-term risks that we can only find out via longer clinical trials. But how long is long enough?” The first COVID-19 medications to reach patients, however, are likely to be antibody treatments. Antibodies are molecules produced by human immune systems to combat viruses, which usually work by blocking the virus from binding to host cells. They can be an effective treatment for patients infected with a virus, as well as a prophylactic for preventing infections.  One of the companies working on a COVID-19 antibody treatment is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The New York-based firm is working to harvest antibodies by injecting SARS-CoV-2 into mice that are genetically modified to have human immune systems. According to Alexandra Bowie, a spokesperson for the company, Regeneron is still uncertain when its antibody therapy will be ready for use on humans. She added that the firm previously developed and started testing Ebola antibodies within six months. WuXi Biologics, a Shanghai-based biotech company, is collaborating with Vir Biotechnology in California to produce a similar treatment. The two firms expect to begin clinical trials in about three to four months, according to Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics. “Using neutralizing antibodies for viral infections is quite safe, because they bind to very specific targets that only exist on the intended viruses,” says Chen, who has no relation to Chen Tenghui.  Yet frontline medics realize even these treatments will only become available after the initial phase of the epidemic is over. “As clinicians, we certainly hope a drug or vaccine can be developed as soon as possible, but history and experience tell us that’s impractical,” says Shen Yinzhong, a director at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Shen says his team is focusing on saving lives using well-established symptomatic and supportive therapy, such as administering anti-inflammatories and maintaining patients’ oxygen levels. “Even if we don’t have a drug or vaccine now, we can still control the epidemic using traditional measures: quarantine, disinfection, and occupational protection,” he adds. Vaccines will become vital, though, if COVID-19 does develop into a seasonal disease. Chen Xi, an assistant professor of public health at Yale University, tells Sixth Tone the world is paying the price for failing to develop a SARS vaccine in 2003.  “A coronavirus vaccine is long overdue from 17 years ago,” says Chen, who isn’t related to Chris Chen or Chen Tenghui. “Even if it (a SARS vaccine) hadn’t worked well on SARS-CoV-2, we would’ve gained so much more experience in how to make one.” Costly and unlikely to generate immediate returns, companies are often unwilling to invest in vaccine development and the field requires significant financial support from governments and research foundations.  The first experimental SARS vaccine began clinical trials 20 months after the virus’s genome sequence was confirmed, but by then the epidemic had ended and most studies were abandoned. Since the emergence of COVID-19, organizations have poured money into vaccine projects once more. Local governments across China have created research funds worth up to 1 billion yuan ($144 million) to support firms pursuing COVID-19 treatments. Jack Ma, founder of tech giant Alibaba, donated 100 million yuan from his Public Welfare Foundation to several research organizations. Internationally, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations — a global partnership for supporting vaccine development — has invested over $60 million on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine projects, after receiving backing from the British and Norwegian governments, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Chen Xi stresses, however, that investment over the long term is even more important. “We should learn from the past and continue investing in vaccine and drug development after this epidemic ends,” says Chen. “Then, we’ll be more prepared the next time a coronavirus hits.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005275
No Bones About It: Hong Kong Dog Tests Positive for COVID-19,"Tests showed “weak positive” results from the Pomeranian, whose owner had contracted COVID-19. Experts are divided on whether the dog could infect humans.",2020-03-06,"A pet Pomeranian that repeatedly tested “weak positive” for the virus that causes COVID-19 most likely got it from its owner, raising questions about whether the animal could serve as a host and infect others, or whether the traces found in its body were even viable. Many experts who discussed the case in Hong Kong agreed the virus came from the dog’s owner, who tested positive for COVID-19, but cautioned against jumping to other conclusions. The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, which first announced the case last week, also stressed that there is still no evidence to show pets can transmit the virus, adding that owners need not worry too much and should certainly not consider abandoning their animals. The dog was tested several times, and results repeatedly showed traces of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the department said in a statement issued late Wednesday. The dog was first tested on Feb. 26, yielding low-level positives from nose and mouth swabs, the department said. Similar tests on Feb. 28 and March 2 found the same results. The same “weak positive” result from repeated tests based on different swabs indicated that the dog was infected rather than just showing surface contamination of virus particles spread by its owner, Dr. Thomas Sit Hon-chung, assistant director of inspection and quarantine at the AFCD, said Thursday. “If it was contamination, the dog’s nasal or oral mechanism should have a way to clean the viruses,” Sit said. “It would not stay for that long.” Officials in Hong Kong concluded that it was a case of “low-level infection” after consulting international experts, he said, although the blood test results are still pending. A blood sample that was taken from the dog on March 3 will be able to confirm infection by detecting antibodies. It often takes at five to seven days for the results. A department official told Caixin the dog in question was a Pomeranian and was taken into the department’s care on Feb. 26 with none of the COVID-19 symptoms experienced by humans, such as cough, runny nose, or difficulty breathing. “Experts from the School of Public Health of The University of Hong Kong, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong and the World Organisation for Animal Health have been consulted, and unanimously agreed that these results suggest that the dog has a low-level of infection and it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission,” the department said in its statement. The department added that it will continue testing the dog and only return it to its owner when the results are negative. An official from the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection previously told Caixin that the dog’s 60-year-old owner was diagnosed with the virus on Feb. 25. She started coughing on Feb. 12, was hospitalized on Feb. 24, and is now in stable condition. Her brother and sister-in-law also tested positive, though neither showed any symptoms. The multiple weak positives showed the dog had been infected, and perhaps could serve as an intermediate host for cross-species transmission of the new coronavirus, Zhu Huachen, associate director of the Joint Institute of Virology at Hong Kong University, told Caixin. She said the dog’s lack of symptoms showed the virus could live inside it, allowing the animal to secrete and spread the virus at the same time. Other experts disagree. The 2003 outbreak of SARS also saw a small number of animals show low levels of that virus, but none became sick and none could spread the virus to humans, Vanessa Barrs, Chair Professor of Companion Animal Health and Disease at City University’s Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, said Wednesday. Sit of the AFCD said researchers at HKU are analyzing the genetic map of the virus found in the dog, and would compare samples from the owner to figure out whether the dog contracted the virus directly from the owner and whether the virus had mutated. Others pointed out that it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions without a blood test result and unclear whether the viral material found in the dog was viable. “All the (tests) tell us is that there is some genomic material from the virus that’s been detected (in the dog),” said Sanjaya Senanayake, a virus expert at the Australian National University. “So it’s not living virus necessarily, it’s not the whole virus, it’s just a little bit of virus — it could be dead virus.”  Senanayake said the dog’s infected owner would likely have been spreading virus particles around her apartment, “coughing, sneezing, wiping her nose, touching surfaces,” and that the dog would have been, “as dogs do, sniffing surfaces, licking surfaces, licking her hands, all sorts of things, and could easily pick up some virus.” It was unclear what would happen if a dog contracted COVID-19, or what kind of symptoms it would show, Senanayake said. “But I think you would want to find live virus in the dog’s nose, throat, or respiratory tract before you start saying it’s infected,” he said, adding that this would require researchers to isolate the virus from a swab and grow it in the lab. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, also stressed the importance of differentiating between a real infection and simply the presence of the virus, and emphasized a restrained reaction. “I still think it’s questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak, as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission,” he said. “We need to find out more, but we don’t need to panic — I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels of the virus. The real driver of the outbreak is humans.” This is an original article written by Wen Simin, Yang Ge, and Flynn Murphy of Caixin Global, and has been republished with permission.

COVID-19 Hospital Adds Antibody Tests as Discharge Requirement,The additional tests at one of Wuhan’s makeshift “shelter hospitals” are intended to ensure that patients have fully recovered from the virus.,2020-03-05,"From Thursday, a temporary “shelter hospital” in the central Chinese city of Wuhan is conducting additional tests on COVID-19 patients who have met the necessary criteria to be discharged, following reports of discharged individuals later testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The makeshift hospital, or fangcang, in the city’s Jiang’an District said that all patients will undergo additional Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) tests before being discharged, according to Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. IgM and IgG are antibodies — or immunoglobulin proteins — that the body’s immune system produces to fight infections. “A negative IgM with a positive IgG result shows a patient has recovered,” a Wuhan-based doctor specializing in respiratory diseases told Sixth Tone. A hospital staff member told The Paper that the IgM and IgG tests, which yield same-day results, are meant to “ensure 100% recovery of the patients.” The hospital’s initiative comes at a time when several medical facilities have reported cases of discharged COVID-19 patients later testing positive for the virus. On Feb. 25, the disease control and prevention center in the southern Guangdong province confirmed that 14% of the discharged COVID-19 patients had tested positive again, though no infections were detected among their close contacts. Song Tie, the center’s deputy director, said during a press conference that young patients with mild symptoms were found to have developed antibodies within weeks to fight infections, while elderly people required more time to build up such defenses. Other provinces including Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hainan, and Hubei — the latter being the center of the COVID-19 epidemic — have also had recovered patients again test positive for the virus later. On Wednesday, the National Health Commission’s latest guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 said that recovered patients discharged from hospitals must be quarantined for 14 days. The previous version of the guideline had only recommended that patients monitor their health for 14 days. The latest guideline did not, however, make any changes to hospitals’ discharge criteria, which include normal body temperature for a minimum of three days, visibly better respiratory symptoms, CT scan improvements, and two negative nucleic acid tests performed at least one day apart. Zhang Zhan, an expert in respiratory diseases and critical care with Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, wrote in a post on social app WeChat last month that 13 of the 18 patients whose discharges were delayed had tested positive again in a third nucleic acid test. He suggested that the discharge criteria be revised to include three consecutive negative nucleic acid tests rather than two. During a press conference last week, leading Chinese respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan said he believed that discharged patients testing positive again could stem from multiple factors including their individual health conditions or the methods applied during the tests. However, he said changing the national criteria for discharging COVID-19 hospital patients would require careful consideration. “Medical care conditions and epidemic control and prevention pressures vary from place to place,” Zhong said in an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television. “If all patients are required to test negative in a stool test — a part of Shanghai’s discharge plan — this might result in an accumulation of patients and impact the diagnosis and treatment of others.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005274
Inside Wuhan’s ‘Fangcang’ Shelter Hospitals,"Since February, Wuhan authorities have sought to quarantine COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms in over a dozen makeshift clinics. How does the system work?",2020-03-05,"Nearly three weeks passed from the day Cindy Chen was shown a worryingly opaque CT scan to the day she was told she could have a hospital bed. Two of these weeks she spent quarantined at her home in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the COVID-19 epidemic; the third she spent in isolation at a designated hotel. But the bed waiting for Chen wasn’t at a typical hospital. Instead, she was admitted to a sports arena — one of 16 temporary “shelter hospitals,” or fangcang, set up in Wuhan since early February to help alleviate the shortage of beds in dedicated hospitals.  The 36-year-old Wuhan resident had been experiencing fatigue, intermittent fever, and a dry cough since taking her feverish father-in-law to see doctors in late January. CT scans showed that both patients had lung damage, though the overburdened health care system at the time — understaffed and short of beds, medical supplies, and nucleic acid tests — made it impossible for them to be admitted. Out of options, they would try and take care of themselves at home for the next two weeks. In China, there are around 1,000 people for every six hospital beds, according to official data. Unequally concentrated medical resources often mean cities or even entire provinces must rely on a few large hospitals for their most urgent needs. The shortage of hospital beds in Wuhan was exposed early as the city grappled with the COVID-19 epidemic and eventually went into lockdown on Jan. 23. During the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, many infected patients with mild symptoms were unable to receive treatment because beds were reserved for patients whose conditions were severe. But delayed treatment carried the risk of these mild patients’ health deteriorating to severe, while insufficient quarantine periods may have caused the epidemic to spread further, Ma Xiaowei, the head of China’s National Health Commission, said last week.  The solution authorities came up with was to set up makeshift hospitals for accepting and quarantining patients with mild symptoms, by far the largest demographic among the city’s confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. Since early February, 16 public venues in Wuhan, from sports arenas to exhibition centers, have been converted to fangcang hospitals, contributing an extra 13,000 beds and bringing the city’s total number to over 27,000 by Feb. 16. As of this week, the megacity of 11 million inhabitants has reported around 50,000 COVID-19 cases, around half of which have recovered. Unlike Huoshenshan and Leishenshan — the two emergency hospitals built from scratch to accommodate the most severely ill patients — fangcang hospitals act as buffers for patients who aren’t sick enough to need urgent treatment but should still be under medical observation. Mild patients can be admitted to fangcang after testing positive for the coronavirus. Only and if their situation gets worse will they be transferred to a hospital with a higher care standard. Older people with preexisting health conditions are not admitted to fangcang, which provide only limited treatment and may not be suitable for those with weaker immune systems.  With Wuhan authorities seeking to “round up” all suspected carriers of the novel coronavirus, the local neighborhood committee paid a visit to Chen’s family on Feb. 12 and asked them to stay in a quarantine hotel for 14 days. After she tested positive for COVID-19 while there, she was sent to the converted stadium fangcang, where she received one of the last available beds in a ward for female patients. Her father-in-law, meanwhile, was sent to Leishenshan.  Chen told Sixth Tone the nurses would check their temperatures and blood oxygen levels four times a day. The medics gave patients daily TCM therapies, including medicines and occasionally herbal plasters. In the mornings, afternoons, and sometimes evenings, staff would encourage the patients to relax by dancing or doing tai chi-like exercises. When she was bored, Chen would check her phone or watch one of the TVs around the facility. “In fact, I felt quite relaxed,” Chen said. “Although there are many patients in the place, everyone is chatting together, and it feels a lot better than being isolated alone in a room.” As her recovery in the fangcang progressed, Chen asked for a nucleic acid test again on Feb. 24. The criteria to be discharged are strict: consecutive negative nucleic acid tests, a CT scan showing lungs on the mend, and no symptoms — especially fever — for at least three days, in addition to passing a final review. Luckily, Chen managed to check all of these boxes and left the fangcang on March 2. Many more patients have been discharged from fangcang, too. Earlier this week, one of the 16 temporary facilities announced it would shut down after discharging or transferring the last of its patients.  In stark contrast to the early days of the epidemic, over half of all fangcang beds are now empty. Authorities believe that the shelter hospitals have played a crucial role in bringing the epidemic situation in Wuhan under control. “Building fangcang hospitals was a critical and significant move,” Ma said last week. “We have rapidly expanded our medical resources over the near term, and it would have been difficult to come up with so many beds in such a short time in any other way.”  Experts have largely echoed this assessment. Wang Chen, a top respiratory specialist in China who also works on the front lines, said in an interview last month that fangcang — while perhaps not perfect — are at least a realistic solution. “The shelter hospitals can admit a large number of patients and get them treated and quarantined, which is key,” Wang said. But not everyone’s fangcang-assisted road to recovery has been as smooth as Chen’s. The spartan living conditions, lack of privacy, and risks of cross-infection are all common complaints among patients. A 35-year-old Wuhan native who now lives in eastern China’s Jiangsu province told Sixth Tone that his mother was admitted to a fangcang hospital in Wuhan’s Hanyang District on Feb. 12, but inadequate medical equipment, and especially a lack of access to CT scanners, hampered the transfer of patients whose conditions had deteriorated while they waited to be diagnosed. “There were some emergency situations,” the man, surnamed Lin, told Sixth Tone. Some patients died in their beds, which distressed the other patients, including Lin’s mother. Things only began to look up after the CT scanners started working after 10 days or so, according to Lin. “She’s recovering slowly,” Lin said, referring to his mother. “I’m not sure if there will be any lingering effects.”  During an epidemic situation, temporary facilities like fangcang can only serve their intended purpose if they’re well-stocked and well-staffed, according to Liu Shi-yung, a historian of medicine and public health and visiting professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “Unlike traditional quarantine hospitals, fangcang are more like treatment units,” Liu told Sixth Tone. Fangcang should be seen as supplementary facilities to hospitals, and should be integrated with nearby medical resources, as has largely been the case, according to Liu.  Given the lessons of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, officials and health care professionals have stressed the need for differentiating among mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 cases. “When these distinctions are not being made, resources can be wasted, and there’s a high risk of ‘mild’ becoming ‘severe’ at any given time, which is the real risk of cross-infection,” said the professor. Quarantine has been a common practice during epidemics throughout history, since the Black Death in the 14th century. But only since the discovery of antibiotics have quarantine hospitals served any useful purpose, and much of the emphasis during epidemics remains on isolating the sick, according to Liu. Isolation also awaited Chen when she left the fangcang: She’s now spending 14 days quarantined in a school dormitory. Alone in her bunk, Chen said she’s still afraid she might test positive for the virus again, which might send her back through the same long process all over again. A silver lining, however, is that she can finally enjoy a hot shower and wash her hair at her leisure, which she was rarely able to do at the fangcang. “I will try to get used to this,” she said. “After all, my family is safe, and as long as I can make sure that I stay well, I’ll be able to go home after 14 days. I have to look on the bright side.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005273
Hubei Struggles to Handle a Mountain of Medical Waste,"The COVID-19 epidemic is forcing cities to enlist incinerators, industrial furnaces, and cement kilns to destroy tons of used medical equipment.",2020-03-03,"In late January, Hubei Zhongyou Youyi EP Technology Co. — a waste treatment company based in the central Chinese city of Xiangyang — received a call from the local authorities. Officials requested the firm to send any workers and vehicles they could spare to Wuhan, the city at the heart of the COVID-19 epidemic, as soon as possible. A convoy of five Hubei Zhongyou garbage trucks made the 350-kilometer journey Jan. 29. Their mission was to help transport tons of used face masks, biohazard suits, and bedclothes from Wuhan’s hospitals to disposal sites for destruction. At first, the small team of 12 workers and volunteers thought the cleanup job would only take a week. But now, a month later, Hubei Zhongyou has as many as 85 people stationed in Wuhan as the virus-stricken city struggles to deal with unprecedented volumes of contaminated waste.  The central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with over 67,000 people infected and 2,800 killed as of Monday. The crisis has stretched local health systems to their breaking point, forcing the government to build new hospitals from scratch, convert exhibition centers into makeshift wards, and dispatch thousands of medical workers to the region. But while attention has been focused on Hubei’s shortage of hospital beds and supplies, cities have also faced severe shortfalls in staff, vehicles, and treatment facilities able to safely dispose of used medical equipment. Waste from hospitals has to be dealt with carefully, as it may be infected with harmful microorganisms and could become a secondary source of infection, health experts told Sixth Tone.  “Protective clothing, surgical gowns, as well as bed sheets and duvet covers used by coronavirus patients — this stuff can’t be reused,” said Yin Kaiwen, head of logistics at a designated clinic for patients infected with COVID-19 based in Wuhan. Cities have specialized systems for disposing of medical waste, but they were quickly overwhelmed during the early stages of the epidemic. Before the outbreak began, Wuhan had one dedicated medical waste treatment facility with a processing capacity of 50 tons per day. By Jan. 24, however, the city was producing four times that amount. Bags of used equipment piled up in parking lots outside some hospitals in Wuhan due to the backlog at treatment plants and lack of waste transportation vehicles. Nearly 200 tons of additional waste remained inside storage facilities, according to government estimates. “The epidemic in Wuhan is the worst in the country,” said Yan Zuhai, deputy head of publicity at Wuhan’s ecology and environment bureau, in a phone interview with Sixth Tone Feb. 26. “Faced with this powerful enemy, the city currently doesn’t have the capacity to handle the (medical) waste.” China took emergency measures to deal with the crisis Jan. 28, handing local authorities the power to burn medical waste using nonstandard facilities, set up mobile treatment centers, and transport excess waste to nearby cities for disposal.  In the weeks since, Wuhan has used incinerators designed for household and hazardous waste, industrial furnaces, and even cement kilns to destroy used medical supplies. It has also enlisted the help of treatment companies in other cities, including Hubei Zhongyou. “Wuhan’s medical waste disposal system isn’t designed to cope with an emergency,” said Sun Yu, director of enterprise management at Hubei Zhongyou. “We’re helping them relieve their shortage of transportation and treatment capacity.” Sun’s firm has dispatched 36 vehicles to Wuhan since Jan. 29. Most of these trucks are used to ferry trash to local disposal sites. Others transport waste all the way to Hubei Zhongyou’s own treatment plants in Xiangyang, where it undergoes high-temperature disinfection and incineration before being sent to a landfill. Other cities in Hubei have faced similar spikes in medical waste as the epidemic has spread. Huanggang, a city neighboring Wuhan, has one medical waste treatment plant with a capacity of 15 tons per day, but during the Lunar New Year the city’s hospitals were producing 25 tons daily, according to Wang Sihai, the plant’s deputy manager.  “During the peak period, we received numerous calls every day from hospitals asking us to collect their trash,” said Huang, adding that the excess waste was sent to a hazardous waste treatment facility. In Xiangyang, Hubei Zhongyou also had to send medical waste to its hazardous waste plant. The firm was handling 15 tons of waste per day, while its medical waste plant could only process 10 tons each day, according to Sun. While the situations in Xiangyang and Huanggang have stabilized during February as the number of new coronavirus infections in the cities has fallen, according to Sun and Wang, official data suggests there hasn’t been a significant downturn in demand from Wuhan. By Feb. 26, Wuhan had quintupled its medical waste treatment capacity from 50 tons per day to 263 tons — 100 tons of which was made up of the household waste incinerators used to process “ordinary medical waste,” according to a report by China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE).  Waste treatment companies in Wuhan who spoke with Sixth Tone reported being under severe pressure. “It’s like we’re fighting a war,” said a manager at one plant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media. “Medical waste has to be treated within a day. Our facilities now operate around-the-clock.” The company is also struggling with labor shortages, as workers are either unable to travel to the plants due to the ongoing travel disruptions in locked-down Hubei or unwilling to handle potentially infectious trash, according to the manager. Local governments have supplied protective equipment to workers at treatment plants, industry insiders told Sixth Tone, but people remain wary. “Hiring workers is extremely hard these days — it wasn’t a problem before,” the manager said. “The situation hasn’t improved yet. We’re very concerned.” The voluntary assistance, meanwhile, is costing some firms significant sums of money. Hubei Zhongyou’s work in Wuhan has already cost the company 7.2 million yuan ($1 million), Sun estimates.  “We’re doing it for the public good, but we don’t know when the epidemic will end,” said Sun. “If we maintain our aid to Wuhan at the current scale until the end of March, our financial costs will be an estimated 20 million yuan.” Experts say the COVID-19 crisis has exposed fundamental weaknesses in China’s waste treatment sector that need to be fixed to prevent similar crises from erupting in the future. Cities were unprepared for an emergency and lacked medical waste transportation vehicles, disposal facilities, and waste handlers, wrote Sun Ning (no relation of Hubei Zhongyou’s Sun Yu), head of environmental engineering at the Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning, in an article published Feb. 25.  Even during normal periods, medical waste disposal facilities in 76 cities were “under great operation pressure” and unable to keep up with the amount of waste being produced, Hu Hualong, deputy director of MEE’s Solid Waste and Chemicals Management Technology Center, said at a 2018 conference. As many as one-quarter of prefecture-level cities in China don’t have a centralized medical waste disposal plant, while some rural areas don’t collect medical waste for treatment at all, Hu added. Due to inadequate oversight, a lack of treatment facilities, and high disposal fees, a black market for medical waste has emerged in some parts of China, with waste sold through illegal recycling channels being repurposed to manufacture children’s toys and chopsticks. Zhang Yi, chairman of China’s Strategic Emerging Industry Environmental Protection Union, told Sixth Tone the government should create a plan for improving cities’ medical waste treatment infrastructure, as it has done previously for wastewater and household waste. “As a form of hazardous waste, medical waste is a major issue,” said Zhang. “Making a special plan can offer solutions at a systemic level and will help raise awareness and funds.”  Most analysts and industry insiders who spoke with Sixth Tone, however, remain optimistic that the COVID-19 epidemic will galvanize the government to introduce major reforms, as was the case after the 2003 SARS crisis. Before this earlier epidemic, even Beijing didn’t have a centralized facility for handling medical waste, but over the following years authorities invested heavily in improved treatment infrastructure. “The government should learn from the coronavirus epidemic and establish emergency plans for medical waste management,” said Zhang. “After the outbreak, they (now) understand the necessity of establishing medical waste treatment systems to cope with emergencies and ensure public safety.” This past Wednesday, 10 government ministries jointly published a plan stating that every prefecture-level city should have a centralized medical waste treatment facility by the end of 2020. It also said every county in China should establish a system for collecting, transferring, and treating medical waste by the end of June 2022. “(The epidemic) is a reminder that we should consider emergencies when building waste treatment facilities,” said a professor at a Chinese university specializing in solid waste treatment, who requested anonymity because he’s not authorized to speak to the media. “Even if the capacity isn’t put into use every day, we have to have it when we need it — like we need firefighters.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005263
Domestic Violence Cases Surge During COVID-19 Epidemic,Rights activists say law enforcement officials need to be more responsive to reports of gender-based violence.,2020-03-02,"On Feb. 11, Xiao Li received a distressing call from a 12-year-old crying for help. The child was wandering the deserted streets of their hometown in the central Henan province with his mother and 7-year-old sister. Their father had physically abused their mother and then kicked them out of the house at a time when many cities, including theirs, were on lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. Their mother, surnamed Wang, had already divorced the man, but he had coerced her and the children into spending the Lunar New Year with his family. Xiao told Sixth Tone that Wang — a distant relative — had wanted to escape her abusive ex-husband and make the 50-kilometer trip to see Xiao. But it was extremely difficult to get a permit from the police to leave a city under lockdown. After much fruitless discussion, Xiao said she finally managed to convince the police to give her a driving permit. Xiao said she met Wang and the children at her town’s border — which they had walked five hours toward before Wang’s ex-husband picked them up and drove them the rest of the way. “We were super worried about how easy it was for the abuser to beat her during the lockdown,” Xiao said. “There were no restaurants open, no transportation allowed. They (Wang and her children) hadn’t eaten in so long.”  While millions of people are spending time indoors, rights activists say there have been increasing instances of domestic violence — a crime in China since a landmark anti-domestic violence law went into effect in March 2016. Wan Fei, a retired police officer who is now the founder of an anti-domestic violence nonprofit in Jingzhou, a city in the central Hubei province, told Sixth Tone that reports of domestic violence have nearly doubled since cities were put under lockdown. He said that as of Friday, the police station in Jianli County, which is administered by Jingzhou, had received 162 reports of domestic violence in February — three times more than the 47 reported during the same month the previous year. The number of cases reported in January had also doubled compared with the same period last year. “The epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,” said Wan. “According to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence are related to the COVID-19 epidemic.” Wan believes the fear and anxiety from the extended quarantine, as well as the economic strain put on many families, may have contributed to the uptick. Meanwhile, support systems for survivors of domestic violence have weakened. On Wednesday, a woman from the southern city of Shenzhen shared a recorded conversation with a police officer on microblogging platform Weibo in which the latter is heard asking her to forget about pursuing the case. “He has a very good job. You would ruin his life if you reported him,” the officer is heard saying. “Why would you believe his words (death threats) when he was drunk?” A day later, Shenzhen police said the abuser would be detained for five days, and that the police officer in question had been “educated.” Although Wan said his colleagues have personally visited many individuals who’ve reported domestic violence, police in some parts of China have been reluctant to help the survivors, especially during the epidemic. He added that many shelters for survivors have been converted into homeless shelters by the authorities, while some officers vacillate when it comes to detaining perpetrators due to several recent COVID-19 clusters in prisons.  “While everyone’s attention is on the epidemic, victims of domestic violence are very much being neglected,” Wan said. “They deserve more attention and help.” With a spike in domestic violence-related cases amid the epidemic, some nonprofits have even published special manuals instructing survivors on how to better protect themselves and directing them to online legal aid, if needed. Feng Yuan, the director of Beijing-based women’s rights nonprofit Weiping, told Sixth Tone that they have also received a substantial number of domestic violence-related reports since the Lunar New Year vacation a little over a month ago — beginning around the time several cities went into lockdown. She added that police should be more proactive in registering survivors’ complaints instead of finding excuses to not help them. “The police can detain people for insulting (leading respiratory disease expert) Zhong Nanshan online and arrest someone for not wearing a mask on the street. It looks to me like the epidemic has not affected their law enforcement capacity,” Feng said. “If they use the epidemic as an excuse to not deal with domestic violence cases, that’s not acceptable.” To empower women, Feng held a livestreamed workshop on Saturday where she shared what a person can do when they witness or become aware of domestic violence. “It’s very important to let domestic violence survivors know their rights, and as witnesses we should all give them confidence and support,” she said.

Life on Wuhan’s Virtual Front Lines,"As the city grapples with a deadly coronavirus outbreak, residents, doctors, and experts have organized counseling and support groups online.",2020-02-28,"The lead-up to Lunar New Year is a busy time for social workers in Wuhan, and this year was no exception, with our schedules chock-full of all the usual community events. Then, on Jan. 20, as the government finally began to acknowledge the danger posed by a deadly coronavirus outbreak in the city, all our activities were canceled. It came out of nowhere. Just the day before, everyone was still going about their lives as normal: I’d spotted only a few people wearing masks on the street, and rumors about the virus seemed remote. The next morning, I was told that a resident of an elderly home I had visited four days previously may have been infected. That meant I, too, was at risk, and I would have to quarantine myself at home for 14 days while keeping an eye out for any symptoms. I was dumbstruck. I still didn’t even understand what this mysterious illness was, and I had no idea how I was going to quarantine myself for two weeks. Two days later, on Jan. 23, the city went into an almost complete lockdown, shutting down transit links in and out of the city. The atmosphere was suddenly much tenser. Everyone I knew was sharing information about the outbreak, but it was hard to tell what was real and what was fake. Everything was confusing and scary. Quarantine That evening, I saw on my friend’s social media WeChat feed that some social workers in Wuhan and Beijing had set up a special group chat to provide assistance and counseling to people living in quarantine. As a social worker, I felt like I could contribute some of my expertise — and as someone who had just been put in quarantine myself, I was all too aware that these services were desperately needed. I immediately asked to join. Within five hours of the group’s inception, we had 300 members. We started another the next morning, as the first group neared the app’s chat group ceiling of 500 members, but the requests to join just kept pouring in. Only then did I realize how many people in Wuhan were quarantined in their homes with suspected symptoms and nowhere to turn for help. Because of restrictions on movement and public gatherings, volunteers have no way of entering communities or providing services face-to-face. However, the group I’m affiliated with has nonetheless been able to organize close to 2,000 online volunteers from all over the country — most of them doctors, psychological counselors, or social workers — and we’ve responded to more than 20,000 requests through our network. Much of our time is spent answering questions about life under quarantine, talking about how to care for sick people at home, and sharing reliable information about the virus. But many also seek us out for more direct assistance. In more serious circumstances, such as medical emergencies or cases of severe psychological distress, we give advice, ask for continual updates on their situation, and provide what resources we can in a private, one-on-one chat. The early days were the most difficult. Many people in my groups were asking how to find a hospital bed for their sick family members. Some were critically ill themselves, but had nowhere to go: At the time, there was a dire shortage of hospital beds in the city, forcing patients to wait at home in the hopes that a bed would open up before their condition worsened. Due to the shortage of beds, many patients in Wuhan even now cannot be admitted directly to hospitals; instead, they must report their condition to their residential community and apply to be admitted to a hospital. I’ve helped patients in urgent need of assistance file reports and provided info on hotlines to contact the city’s mayor or resources for medical guidance. Like others, I’ve also used my own position within the civil service apparatus to make calls and desperately try to get them help. Sometimes, asking for aid on social networks like Weibo or TikTok can also draw attention to a case and get it resolved faster. Hard to Breath All too often, we’d find ourselves in a race against death. One woman told us her father was in critical condition, having difficulty breathing, and urgently in need of hospitalization. We were all anxious: The man was only 52 years old. We got in touch with hospital administrators and district leaders, exhausting every possible lead. I’m not sure which one paid off in the end, but he was finally admitted to a hospital the next day. Our celebrations were cut short when his daughter got in touch with us again that evening. The man’s doctors had told her he would have to be placed on a respirator immediately or else he might not make it through the night. Only, that hospital didn’t have any respirators left. By that point, the woman’s father was already hovering between life and death. We raced against the clock to contact hospitals in the city, searching for an available machine. Some doctors in our group chats tried to help, but no one could find any. One told me that, given the man’s condition, he might not survive even if we did find one, but I didn’t have the heart to tell that to his daughter. She kept telling me he was going to make it. “I won’t be without my father,” I remember her saying. “He’s going to pull through.” All I could tell her was to support her father as best she could. As soon as our conversation ended, I rushed off to the bathroom to cry. In moments like these, it’s easy to feel powerless. Fortunately, a doctor in our group managed to find an oxygen mask the next day. Although it wasn’t a full respirator, against all odds the man was able to hold on to life, and he has since slowly started to recover. Our frantic search for respirators woke up some of our volunteers elsewhere to the lack of vital equipment here in Wuhan. We immediately launched a fundraiser and scraped together enough money for 10 respirators, which we’ve since donated to various hospitals around the city. On the Mend Volunteers in my groups interact with hundreds of people a day. At our busiest, some of us work from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. It’s stressful, but no one complains. One Beijing-based counselor with experience helping victims of the SARS epidemic in 2003 provided nonstop counseling for six hours one day due to a shortage of volunteers. We ended up having to force her to take a break from her screen. I’ve been so busy, I’ve at times forgotten to eat. I’ve never been under so much pressure in my entire life, but the sight of so many people selflessly working together has inspired me to carry on. Now that many patients have been admitted to Wuhan’s makeshift hospitals, our workload is somewhat lighter. Since their medical needs are being met, people now mostly contact us for psychological and practical support. Some medical staff and patients who have been in quarantine for a long time are dealing with severe stress — a few describe a feeling akin to having a heart attack. To help, we’ve invited psychiatrists and other medical experts to offer online consultations. Many people who have been quarantined in hotel rooms or transferred to makeshift hospitals, as well as their family members, still keep in touch with us through the group chat. Some have expressed dissatisfaction with conditions in their new environments: For them, the group has become a way to let off steam and share details about their lives with patients at other institutions. We’re also getting more and more reports from patients who previously came to us for help, and who are now recovering or released from the hospital. Perhaps because the majority of people we help aren’t in critical condition, I’m not aware of any fatalities within our immediate circle. As for those who’ve gotten better, many are eager to give back: Some have gone on to volunteer at makeshift hospitals or joined our chat groups as a resource for others. I am just one of millions of people in Wuhan at this particular time. I may not have left my home for a month, but in that span I’ve seen the full spectrum of human emotion: from suffering and helplessness to joy at the prospect of a full recovery. I can only hope that everyone will know such happiness, sooner rather than later. As told to Cai Yiwen.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005250
Job Seekers Anxious About Employment Amid COVID-19 Epidemic,"While many graduating seniors are worried about uncertainty in the current job market, recruiters are predicting some industries will bounce back and create more opportunities.",2020-02-28,"Liu Licheng is afraid of the novel coronavirus, but she is more fearful of her career prospects in the post-virus era. In the past two weeks, the business administration student has submitted more than 50 résumés online. The 22-year-old has been indoors for a month, mostly writing her senior thesis and hoping that the COVID-19 epidemic won’t affect her prospects of finding a job when she graduates in June. “I figured at least one of them would have given me an offer (by now),” Liu, who attends a university in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. Just a month ago, many graduating seniors may not have thought that an invisible scourge would add extra challenges to an already-competitive job market. This year, a record-breaking 8.74 million students in China are expected to graduate from college — 400,000 more than last year. According to Wang Hui, an education ministry official, the employment prospects for college graduates in the first half of 2020 are expected to be “more complex and severe” in the aftermath of the epidemic. To control the spread of the virus, authorities have canceled classes, encouraged schools to start the new semester online, and even urged recruiters to seek out prospective applicants virtually to make it easier for graduating students to start looking for jobs. “For most students, delaying school only means that they need to take online classes and their summer holiday might be shortened,” Liu said. “But for those of us who are supposed to graduate in June, it will affect our thesis writing and defense, graduation ceremony, and even important life choices such as whether to look for a job or go abroad for further study.”  Employers as well as relevant authorities seem to understand the woes of students like Liu, and are seeking possible solutions. While the local government in Beijing said it plans to host 82 online recruiting events by the end of February, the eastern city of Suzhou said it will ensure that more than 100,000 jobs are provided for college graduates throughout the year, aiming to maintain an employment rate of over 95%. Meanwhile, the eastern city of Hangzhou has launched a “cloud job fair” with over 28,000 opportunities for talents at home and abroad. Leading Chinese tech and e-commerce giants — including Baidu, Huawei, Tencent, and Alibaba — have adopted “contactless” recruiting activities to reduce mass gatherings and cross-contamination. Candidates can complete all application-related procedures online, after which they’ll be notified of a virtual interview if successful. According to a recent survey by leading recruitment portal Zhaopin, 68.2% of the 1,644 enterprises surveyed said they hope the platform will provide accurate résumé-matching services, while 55% of the firms said they will use video-interviewing services. Liu said she has already undergone a few online interviews, and the process wasn’t as difficult as she had expected. Though her university has trained students for online interviews and she’s “well prepared,” Liu said she’s more concerned that COVID-19 will deplete her interview opportunities. Data released Thursday by job-seeking platform Boss Zhipin showed that the overall demand for fresh graduates is 44% lower than at the same point last year. Employment prospects in the pharmaceutical industry shrank by 8.8%, while recruitment demand in the advertising and media sectors has dropped by nearly 72% compared with the previous year. However, not all industries are showing declining hiring numbers. According to Liepin, another major recruitment platform, demand for employment in some fields is expanding. Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 7, demand for talents in the fields of personal care and services, online education, and internet health care has seen year-on-year increases of 89%, 88%, and 82% respectively. But that hasn’t stopped many from worrying. Florence Li, who is graduating from an Australian university in June, was in her hometown of Fuzhou for the holidays when all of her plans started to crumble. The 25-year-old’s internship in Shanghai has been put on hold for now because of the epidemic, and she can’t even return to Australia for the new semester starting Monday due to restrictions imposed on travelers from China. “They (the Shanghai company) said they would hold my offer but had no idea when I could start,” Li told Sixth Tone, adding that the absence of workplace experience would also affect her thesis, which largely depends on it. “So far, everything looks uncertain.” Zhang Yan, a senior headhunter in Shanghai, said that over half of her clients have delayed their recruitment schedules and will resume their searches depending on how the situation evolves. However, she suggested that fresh graduates set appropriate expectations and avoid excessive anxiety. “If the epidemic continues to spread, more companies will lay off workers and continue to reduce recruitment costs,” she said. “(But) when it’s over, there will be more job fairs and opportunities for graduates. After all, gold always shines.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005242
China’s Bookstores Band Together To Survive the Epidemic,"For an industry that relies heavily on the physical presence of customers, creativity and shared solutions may be the keys to staying afloat.",2020-02-28,"Earlier this week OWSpace, a trendy Chinese bookstore chain, issued a heartfelt plea to its erstwhile customers, begging them to help keep the business afloat by buying store spending cards. The COVID-19 epidemic was disrupting logistics networks and keeping people homebound, resulting in a sales dip of over 80%, according to a post Monday on microblogging platform Weibo. If the situation continues, the 15-year-old company will likely be bankrupt within sixth months, the post said. “During this arduous time for everyone, it is our hope that every person and every bookstore will finally walk out from loneliness and embrace the spring,” OWSpace wrote. The post was widely circulated on Chinese social media, with the well-known actor Yao Chen sharing it to her 83 million Weibo followers. Many users pledged their support, and some even admitted they were moved to tears by the sincerity and urgency of the message.  It may seem obvious that bookstores — which already face stiff competition from large e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba — are vulnerable to economic shocks like the COVID-19 epidemic. But the pill is particularly bitter to swallow given a recent revival in China’s bookselling industry. After struggling amid the rise of e-commerce in the late 2000s, which resulted in a number of high-profile business closures, China’s bookselling industry began to recover around 2013 as a new breed of slickly designed, highly modern bookshops began popping up in commercial districts in cities across the country, providing spaces for relaxation, refreshment, and cultural exchange. Many of these stores have attracted loyal fan followings and become selfie-worthy hot spots.  But the current epidemic is driving these fragile new businesses — which rely heavily on social gatherings and in-person experiences — to extinction. “The arrival of this virus has destroyed people’s consumption habits,” Zhou Juan, director of public affairs at Yanjiyou, a five-year-old bookstore chain with 62 outlets nationwide, told Sixth Tone. “People suddenly can’t go outside; they can only stay home. That’s why this is such a massive blow to bookstores.”  The coronavirus’ impact has been compounded by its timing. The Lunar New Year holiday is a crucial period for bookstores, as people have ample free time to go shopping, according to Zhou. A survey conducted earlier this month of 1,021 bookstore staff found that over 90% of bookselling businesses were closed, and 79% didn’t have the financial resources to survive more than three months. 1200 Bookshop, a 24-hour business in the southern city of Guangzhou, recently had to shut its doors for the first time since it opened in 2014. Bookshops have resorted to some creative tricks to survive the economic crunch. Since Feb. 12, Yanjiyou stores have been delivering books — and tasty-looking cakes, Sixth Tone found — to customers using the ubiquitous food-delivery app Ele.me. The chain is also dabbling in livestreamed content such as book recommendations, panel discussions, and literary readings, as well as publishing videos on Douyin, the Chinese name for TikTok. 1200 Bookshop is now running a “book surprise” service: Customers can pour out their feelings to the store’s WeChat account, then staff will hand-pick a book to send them that matches their current mood. To help companies survive the crisis, industry group Bookstore Alliance published a “self-preservation plan” for Chinese bookstores on social app WeChat, giving shop owners tips for how to handle employee salaries and produce online content during these unprecedented times. Many of the survival tips are similar to those already being employed by other service-related brick-and-mortar businesses in China. In recent weeks, private education firms have turned to conference-call services to connect students with teachers, gym trainers have used livestreaming platforms to broadcast their workout sessions to clients, and nightlife venues have hit on a phenomenon called “cloud clubbing” that involves live DJs playing to midnight ravers in the comfort of their own homes.  “We can’t guess what’s coming next because this is a huge shock not only to the bookselling industry, but also to China’s economy as a whole,” Zhou said. “We must do our best to face it (the epidemic) as actively and optimistically as possible. … We must embrace whatever opportunities come our way.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005252
The Challenge Facing China’s Wild Animal Trade Ban,"If the country is serious about curbing the wild animal trade, it needs to rethink its approach.",2020-02-27,"On Feb. 24, China announced it would implement a “comprehensive” and immediate ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals nationwide. The move cemented an earlier emergency ban enacted amid the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, which has killed 2,800 and sickened over 80,000 worldwide as of Feb. 27. But whether it will have a lasting impact is another question. This isn’t the first time a zoonotic coronavirus has devastated China or sparked a legislative and popular backlash against wild animal consumption. SARS, which some scientists believe jumped to humans from masked palm civets at a wet market in southern China, killed nearly 800 people around the world from 2002 to 2004. While recent research has cast doubt on the theory that COVID-19 originated in a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, virologists still believe it was likely transmitted to humans from wild animals, possibly endangered pangolins. In the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, China updated its existing rules governing the wildlife trade, but a combination of loopholes and muddled enforcement has continued to render them largely ineffective. If we want this time to be different, we first need to understand the cultural and commercial drivers of the trade, as well as the flaws in the current regulatory and enforcement system. Chinese have consumed wild animals for thousands of years, though contrary to stereotypes abroad, they are hardly a fixture of the country’s dinner tables. In its most basic form, the practice was a matter of survival: China had a large population, limited arable land, and a long history of natural and man-made disasters. In times of need, many ordinary Chinese turned to wild animals and plants for sustenance. In non-emergencies, the traditional notion that “like nourishes like” led many to believe that eating animal parts could have a beneficial effect on the diner’s corresponding body part. For example, braised beef tendon was seen as a curative for frail knees, and sheep’s penis as a virility booster. As the above examples show, such customs aren’t necessarily tied to the consumption of wild or exotic animals. But there is a long-standing belief in China that the rarer something is, the greater its value. Rare or hard-to-obtain meat was — and sometimes still is — thought to have extremely potent medicinal effects. It could also be a powerful symbol of filial piety, love, and respect, as in the folk story of the woman who cut flesh from her thigh to cook a medicinal porridge for her mother-in-law. These customs have been reinforced by the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine, which makes liberal usage of ingredients extracted from wild animals — such as tiger bone, pilose antler, and deer fetus. Pangolins are another common source of curatives. And while the consumption of pangolin meat is illegal in the country, an exception for TCM practitioners has long allowed the scales of farm-bred pangolins to be prescribed for medicinal use — a loophole that has greatly complicated efforts to protect the species. China has had a wildlife protection law on the books since 1988, but its single-minded focus on encouraging the commercial rearing and breeding of species over conservation has led many critics to dub it the “wildlife exploitation law.” In particular, species categorized as one of the “three haves” — having “ecological, scientific, or social value,” like pangolins — were eligible to be bred and sold by licensed farms, which have become a key pillar of rural economies in impoverished parts of the country. In addition to forming a regulatory blind spot — the relevant authorities generally lack the resources to ensure wildlife farms are operating legally and within regulations — farm-raised wildlife muddies the waters for what is and isn’t legal to consume. The latest ban, despite its claim to be “comprehensive,” does little to clear things up. One domestic media outlet found over 100 possible exceptions to the new rules, including sika deer, red deer, and ring-necked pheasant. It doesn’t have to be this way. On Feb. 25, the day after China announced its nationwide ban on the wild animal trade, the southern megacity of Shenzhen unveiled its own version of the rules, including a white list with just nine types of meat on it. On the city’s black list were a number of species, including turtles, snakes, and some types of birds that local authorities believed posed a risk to public health, despite still being legal to raise under national law. That’s a far simpler and more effective approach than the convoluted new national ban, but it may not be enough on its own. One of the primary reasons China is so vulnerable to zoonotic diseases is the very nature of its cities — and the places where animals, both wild and domesticated, are sold. Wet markets have been linked to numerous infectious disease outbreaks in China over the years, from SARS to bird flu, and their close proximity to residential areas makes them a sizeable community risk. COVID-19 might not have originated in a Wuhan wet market, but the market’s central location almost certainly helped accelerate its spread. Wet markets’ reputations as incubators for disease makes them easy targets during epidemics, and local governments around the country have responded to the current crisis with bans and cleanup campaigns. The eastern province of Zhejiang, for example, has not just cracked down on the wild animal trade, but also the sale of live poultry. These campaign-style enforcement efforts cannot achieve lasting change. As long as small markets are allowed to sell and slaughter live animals, resource-strapped local governments will be hard-pressed to monitor and regulate their compliance with health and sanitation codes. To reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission, slaughter and packaging operations should be moved to large-scale, advanced, and easier-to-monitor operations away from residential areas. Ultimately, the guiding principles of any legislation should be clarity and practicability. Banning the wildlife trade altogether while carving out a broad array of exceptions for different species and market needs clearly hasn’t been effective. And although Shenzhen’s new guidelines are admirably clear, they likely go too far: One of the delights of any cuisine is variety, and banning all but the most common livestock outright will likely cause resentment that could set back the conservation movement. We need to assess the risks and conservation needs of each individual species before making a clear and definite decision one way or the other. Meanwhile, we should take steps to lower demand for wild animals. There is research showing young Chinese are already less interested in wild animal consumption than older generations. We should encourage this trend through health and scientific education, such as by pointing out the lack of scientific evidence for most TCM remedies. Higher taxes can also be used to slowly discourage consumption of wild animal byproducts. Changing long-ingrained eating habits will take time. Rather than rushing in with a blanket ban, we should rationally examine the issue, identify the core problems, and work to resolve them, step-by-step.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005240
Docuseries Profiles People at the Heart of the COVID-19 Crisis,"“In Wuhan,” co-produced by Bilibili and CCTV, has received overwhelmingly positive reviews since its first episode aired Wednesday.",2020-02-27,"As China continues to battle COVID-19, television crews are stepping in to document the lives of the common people at the center of the epidemic, with a new documentary series called “In Wuhan” premiering Wednesday on streaming site Bilibili. Co-produced by Bilibili, state broadcaster China Central Television, and production crew FigureVideo, the documentary is slated to air weekly online, with eight episodes focusing on different groups of people based in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The first episode, “Lifeline on Wheels,” profiles the volunteer drivers who have been helping transport medical supplies to hospitals and households, and as well as shuttle medical workers between hospitals, since Wuhan went under lockdown on Jan. 23, with all public transportation in the city suspended.  In the first episode, volunteer drivers are seen wearing goggles, gloves, and full hazmat suits while on the road. Daxiang, the organizer of a local volunteer team, is in charge of distributing medical supplies to hospitals and homes. When one of the volunteers on his team falls ill, he sends her groceries, and can be seen breaking down in tears as she gives him a weak wave goodbye from a safe distance. Li Shaoyun — a single mother who became something of a local celebrity in 2017 after domestic media drew attention to the fact that she couldn’t afford a babysitter for her daughter, and so had to drive her around in the back seat of her taxi on long shifts — also appeared in the first episode of the show, as a volunteer who helped match drivers with people who needed various items “ordered” through online chat groups. Li had made headlines earlier this year after she was brutally attacked over a parking dispute by a man wielding an iron bar. “There will come a day when the epidemic goes away, but the emotions and memories during these days will not fade away,” the production crew wrote in a post published on microblogging platform Weibo. The documentary series’ debut episode has been well-received on Weibo, with many users saying they were touched by the selfless efforts of the people of Wuhan, as well as the way in which their stories were presented. “I like this kind of show that isn’t deliberately sensational or too over-the-top, and only uses the simplest lens to record the lives of common Wuhan people fighting against the epidemic,” one Weibo user commented, adding that they were touched “when the woman who delivers free vegetables to residential communities suddenly said, ‘I haven’t been close to my child for three or four days.’” Many people have also left encouraging comments under the video on Bilibili, with the most upvoted message wishing that this epidemic will be the country’s last. “I hope there won’t be any more documentaries about this kind of subject in the future,” the user wrote.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005245
Hospitals Say Lancet Article’s Authors Weren’t Frontline Medics,The medical journal had published an article purportedly written by two frontline nurses pleading for international assistance in China’s struggle to contain the COVID-19 epidemic.,2020-02-27,"Update: Shortly after this story published, The Lancet retracted the article, saying the authors had contacted the journal and said their account was not firsthand, as they had claimed, and they therefore wished to withdraw the piece. In response to an article titled “Chinese medical staff request international medical assistance in fighting against COVID-19,” published in the influential British medical journal The Lancet, the emergency medical team dispatched from Guangdong to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, issued a statement Wednesday saying the two authors, who claimed to be among the first medics from the southern province to arrive at the front lines, were never part of the team and the information in the article is false. “We demand that the authors retract their article in The Lancet, clarify the real situation, and publicly apologize,” the team said in a statement published by the influential newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily. However, for reasons that remain unclear, the statement was later deleted. In The Lancet’s article Monday, the two authors, Zeng Yingchun and Zhen Yan, recounted the challenges they say they encountered in Wuhan, including shortages of protective equipment, physical exhaustion, and mental fatigue. “Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety, and fear,” they wrote. “We need much more help. We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle.”  The first group of 128 medical workers from Guangdong set out for Wuhan on Jan. 24. The names of the two supposed nurses do not appear on the full list of dispatched staff. One of the authors, Zeng, is a gynecological disease researcher at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. When Sixth Tone called the hospital on Thursday, a staff member from its scientific research department said Zeng had not been part of the medical team dispatched to assist with the epidemic control efforts in Wuhan.  “She has never been a clinical nurse, either. The hospital is at a loss as to why she submitted this article to The Lancet — she was never at the front line, so there’s no way she could have shared those so-called firsthand experiences and feelings,” he told Sixth Tone. He added that Zeng is currently away from work on a training session, and the hospital has been unable to reach her. The other author of the Lancet article, Zhen Yan, is a nurse in the acupuncture department of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, also in Guangzhou. When Sixth Tone reached her department on Thursday, a colleague said Zhen had not shown up for work that day. “She was here working with us on the first two days of the week,” the colleague said. “I have no idea why she didn’t come in today.” By Monday, over 2,000 hospital staff from Guangdong had arrived in Wuhan to help meet the city’s growing need for medical expertise. Nationwide, over 30,000 medical workers — around three-quarters of them nurses — have been sent to the front lines from elsewhere in the country. Though people in China can only speculate about the authors’ motivations, their article has sparked debate among Guangdong medical staff who are now in Wuhan. Some say the article cannot represent the voices of all frontline medics, whose work, they argue, has settled into a normal routine after the initial chaos of the early stages of the epidemic. Others, meanwhile, suggest the work of frontline nurses is more physically demanding than that of doctors, and that they therefore deserve a long break.  “I can understand their difficulties — almost all of the (frontline) nurses are women, and most are very young, in their 20s,” said a Guangzhou-based doctor who was dispatched to Wuhan Union Hospital earlier this month to treat patients in critical condition. “I’m not familiar with the two authors, but I think even if they genuinely wanted to seek help, The Lancet is not the right platform,” he said, speaking to Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The doctor admitted that some of his colleagues were under immense pressure, both physically and mentally, after arriving in Wuhan. “We were worried about our own safety and had to deal with a lack of oxygen under all the thick protective equipment,” he said. “But after two weeks, most of us have adjusted well enough to our new work environments.”  The head nurse of the respiratory disease ward at Third People’s Hospital of Hubei Province, surnamed Zhou, told Sixth Tone that the ward’s 36 nurses work three shifts a day — a six-hour morning shift plus eight-hour evening and night shifts — to take care of 34 COVID-19 patients. “Nurses on the morning shifts shoulder the most duties, including administering treatment to patients and disinfecting the facilities — that’s why their working hours are shorter,” Zhou said. “But regardless of which shifts they’re working, all nurses receive three days off each week.”  After three nurses in Zhou’s department became infected with the novel coronavirus in January, hospital management arranged for nurses from other departments to help fill in. “The hospital is mobilizing all of its resources and staff to treat COVID-19 patients,” she said. By Zhou’s recollection, the most difficult time for her team was around two weeks ago, after the central government mandated that all COVID-19 patients be hospitalized for treatment. “At that time, our ward experienced an influx of patients in very serious condition. My team was under enormous pressure,” she said. “But patients are now being admitted and treated in a timelier fashion, so the situation in the ward has improved dramatically.” In Zhou’s ward, the most physically demanding jobs for nurses include mopping floors and moving heavy oxygen canisters. “There are no male nurses in my ward,” Zhou said. “Almost all of the nurses on my team are in their 20s. Despite them being young, I’m confident that, based on our current work arrangements, the team can continue to work sustainably.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005241
"With Clubs Closed, China’s Homebound Musicians Get Experimental",Canceled concerts and forgone festivals mean the country’s quarantined musicians are having to come up with new ways to show off their talents and put food on the table.,2020-02-26,"Like many people of his generation, Lu Zhongqiang has vivid memories of the last time a coronavirus devastated China: The 50-year-old Beijing-based folk musician lived through the SARS outbreak that began in late 2002. By his recollection, the underground music scene in the capital didn’t regain its former vibrancy until the following summer. Back then, Lu says China was home to relatively few live houses, or small-scale performance venues. “Now there are hundreds of them — and by April, half of them may be bankrupt,” he says, referring to the strain that the current coronavirus epidemic, COVID-19, has put on the industry. Lu has reason to be concerned. Most of the gigs he had booked for the first half of this year have been canceled, including a folk music festival in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and several music festivals in China’s less hard-hit coastal provinces. “The estimated losses (to the production company Lu owns) would be over 12 million yuan ($1.7 million),” he says. “At a gross profit rate of 30%, that’s 4 million yuan.” Nearly 20,000 live performances have been canceled or postponed from January to March, according to the China Association of Performing Arts, amounting to an aggregate box-office loss of over 2 billion yuan. However, some musicians are making the most of being housebound and quarantined by converting their homes into performance spaces — an initiative that has piqued the curiosity of clubs, record labels, and event promoters, luring many on board.   Last week, the performing arts association released a proposal to support online streaming of musical performances as well as free shows for medical workers on the front lines of the fight against the epidemic. Lu, meanwhile, has his own approach to combating the epidemic. He has enlisted over a dozen collaborators — including Cuban a cappella group Vocal Sampling and American blues musician Sugar Blue — to work on a song in support of Hubei’s frontline medical workers. Such “disaster ballads” have a long history in China, popping up after the Tangshan Earthquake of 1976, the Yangtze River floods of 1998, the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, and the Wenchuan Earthquake of 2008. But amid this year’s songs encouraging Chinese people to unite and fortify one another against a formidable foe, some are finding fault with what they view as hollow, saccharine lyrics pandering to an ideological rather than a human purpose.  In a Douban post titled “No One Wants To Listen to Your Disaster Ballads Right Now,” a user on the popular social network wrote: “Do the victims want to listen? Do the medics fighting on the front lines want to listen? Don’t bother them! It’s not that you shouldn’t write disaster ballads at all, but they should be written at the right time, and in the right way.” Lu, too, believes in the importance of sending a sincere message. “In the face of big disasters, we feel ashamed talking about (comparatively trivial matters like) literature and the arts,” Lu says. “But it’s not shameful if you’re singing from the heart, and not for fame or wealth.” A Chinese version of this article first appeared in Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005236
China’s Farmers Worried as COVID-19 Stifles Domestic Agriculture,"Experts say the novel coronavirus epidemic will hit small-scale animal farms the hardest, and could have a lasting impact on the industry.",2020-02-25,"Farmers in China are facing a daunting year ahead as unprecedented quarantine measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus have disrupted much of the country’s food supply chain, long before meals reach the table. By Monday, COVID-19 had killed around 2,600 people in China and sickened nearly 80,000 worldwide. With China going to great lengths to bring the virus under control — including sealing off the epicenter and imposing strict restrictions on people’s movements within the country — farmers are among the many groups to be broadsided by the virus’ ripple effects. Roads into villages have been blocked with barricades, and poultry and livestock markets remain shuttered. Xinfadi, the largest farmer’s market in Beijing, said in its latest weekly report that only 13 slaughterhouses in four northern provinces have resumed operations because so few workers have returned from their hometowns after the Lunar New Year holiday. “The epidemic has created a situation where people can’t move and products can’t circulate,” Yang Jinghua, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told Sixth Tone.  For smaller farms, the agricultural trade has effectively ground to a halt. With villages resorting to self-imposed isolation and looking inward to feed themselves, the pressure is mounting on poultry farmers as they cope with feed shortages and slackened demand. Chickens, for example, have shorter life cycles than other farm animals, reaching their market weight in as little as 40 days, so they must be sold and replaced more often. But the epidemic has disrupted the supply chain, cutting off sales channels and keeping past-their-prime chickens cooped-up at farms. Peng Jin, who manages a rural cooperative of over 50 livestock farmers in Dajing Township, in the central Hunan province, said he and his fellow farmers are left with more than 20,000 chickens that they’re having a hard time getting rid of. “The feed can’t come in, and the chickens can’t be shipped out and sold — they’re all stuck at home,” Peng told Sixth Tone. If the 20,000 chickens remain at their farms for much longer, Peng is worried the co-op won’t have sufficient resources to breed the next batch of hatchlings. “Then we must be prepared for half a year’s blank period,” he said. A farmer in the northern Hebei province said that roadblocks in his village had made it difficult for him to sell eggs, which he would previously collect from fellow villagers and take elsewhere to sell. “The price is quite low,” said the farmer, surnamed Li. “Now, my earnings are basically just enough to cover costs.” Prices for both chickens and eggs have been noticeably lower this year compared with 2019. If the poultry industry can’t be restored to normal soon, the effects are likely to linger into the second and third quarters, an official from China’s agriculture ministry said last week.  The central government has been calling for efforts to invigorate the domestic agriculture industry and prevent the epidemic from further disrupting the spring planting and aquaculture seasons. To reverse slowing sales of agricultural products, local governments have encouraged farmers to use the services of e-commerce giants Alibaba and Pinduoduo, including promoting products through livestreaming. Meanwhile, companies in the southern Guangdong province are being offered subsidies to collect unwanted poultry and aquaculture products left untended in pens and pools. Experts argue that the containment measures being implemented in places where there are little or no new cases each day have been counterproductive. “These policies are too simple, too rough,” said Fu Wenge, an agricultural economics professor at China Agricultural University, referring specifically to road restrictions. “They’re one-size-fits-all: ‘I’ll not let you pass, just to be on the safe side.’” The impact on China’s food supply is already being felt, and could have a larger knock-on effect than the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, according to market research firm Bain & Company. “With a wider scope of impact and stricter containment measures than SARS, we believe China’s agriculture and food industry will suffer a greater blow in the short term,” the firm said.  Even farmers with larger, more established operations are struggling to cope with the current market situation. Bai Shengxin, who owns a livestock farm and tree-planting business in the northwestern Gansu province, said he had expected a bumper year after inking deals with contractors in other regions to plant saxaul — a leafless shrub that’s widely used in China to prevent desertification. But with the epidemic, he says he stands to lose around 500,000 yuan ($71,000). “I’m worried. I get up early every day to check the latest updates about the epidemic,” Bai told Sixth Tone. He’s anxious because it’s already tree-planting season in northern China, where he is contracted to work. Even if many local roadblocks are removed now, interregional travel is still restricted, Bai says, making it hard to resume business and hire workers. Yang, the researcher, is worried about farming operations that don’t have the financial resources to last much longer: If they go under, supply could shrink and drive up the prices of some staple foods. The country’s suffering catering industry will need time to recover after the epidemic has been brought under control, according to Professor Fu. And the poultry industry, one of the hardest-hit subgroups of the agriculture sector, could experience major setbacks akin to China’s pork industry being decimated by African swine fever over the past year and a half, Fu said. “The impact on small-holders will be the greatest,” said the professor. “It will hasten the exit of small- and medium-scale farms.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005234
‘Employee Sharing’ an Emerging Trend Amid COVID-19 Epidemic,Many online retailers are hiring temporary workers from less-booming businesses to meet increased demand in China’s e-commerce sector.,2020-02-25,"Chinese companies have come up with a creative way to optimally allocate human resources during the COVID-19 epidemic: “employee sharing.” Several Chinese companies are temporarily hiring — or “sharing” — employees from businesses that haven’t resumed operations or are only partially operating due to concerns over the coronavirus. The so-called shared employees, known as gongxiang yuangong in Chinese, are being hired by supermarkets, e-commerce platforms’ retail stores, and other companies or factories to ease the workforce crunch and put workers where they’re most needed. In early February, Hema Xiansheng, a supermarket chain under e-commerce giant Alibaba, started the initiative by hiring employees from restaurants that were either shut or not entirely reopened. Several companies including domestic retailer Suning and French supermarket chain Carrefour later followed suit. Since late January, restaurants have suffered significant losses with millions of people staying indoors to avoid crowds for fear of contracting the coronavirus. The result has been a sharp rise in demand for online businesses delivering anything from takeout to groceries and more, along with corresponding demand for more couriers and delivery personnel. According to domestic media outlet National Business Daily, more than 3,000 new employees had joined Hema as of Feb. 19, while over 4,000 people had signed up for the “talent-sharing” plan under Suning’s logistics arm as of Feb. 21. The American supermarket chain Walmart has also joined in the trend, hiring more than 3,000 temporary workers from other sectors to work at its branches in cities like Beijing, Fuzhou, and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, bike-sharing company Hellobike has opened 8,000 positions nationwide for bicycle maintenance, according to state-owned Xinhua News Agency. In Hefei, capital of the eastern Anhui province, Hellobike is seeking 300 temporary workers, while 40 employees from a local hotel have started working at an industrial park on one-month contracts. “The employee-sharing scheme can effectively distribute companies’ labor costs and operational burdens,” Cao Jing, director of the Hefei Employment and Human Resources Management Center, told Xinhua. “This also ensures basic income for employees, resolves the problem of a temporary shortage of workers, and is now being recognized by more and more companies.” However, experts have also warned employers to pay attention to the legal risks attached to this new form of employment. Yao Junchang, a lawyer with Beijing Weiheng Law Firm, told Workers’ Daily that companies hiring temporary workers should include detailed provisions in their agreements, including the duration of employment and policy for work-related injury compensation. “At the same time, the companies lending the employees should sign a complete secondment arrangement, pay employees in full, and pay social security on time,” he said. “Employees should pay more attention to safety precautions and require a tripartite agreement or labor agreement to be signed during the temporary employment period and keep records as evidence.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005235
China Races Against Time to Cure Its Virus-Stricken Economy,The country ground to a standstill to contain the spread of COVID-19. Now it has to get going once more.,2020-02-25,"Yao Tong, a quality inspector at Foxconn’s factory in Shenzhen, never expected his Lunar New Year holiday to drag on for 44 days when he headed home to the central Hunan province in January. Like most of China’s millions of migrant workers, he thought it would be just another weeklong family celebration. In the following weeks, however, the novel coronavirus epidemic that hit Wuhan City in the neighboring Hubei province quickly spread across the country, forcing authorities to freeze public transit and extend holidays to contain the illness. Economic activity ground to a halt in much of China as COVID-19 sickened more than 75,000 people by Feb. 24. Despite the fight against the viral epidemic being far from over, China now faces a titanic challenge getting the world’s second-largest economy back into operation. On Feb. 6, a central government office overseeing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 called for an orderly resumption of business as the virus situation outside Hubei showed signs of stabilizing.  But it’s becoming clear that a full recovery will take some time. With China’s production system relying on millions of migrant workers, factories are struggling to simultaneously repopulate factory floors and limit the risks of contagion. Some, including Apple’s largest supplier Foxconn, are competing for workers by offering bounties while also putting returning employees in quarantine. Meanwhile, disrupted supply chains are holding down production. Some enterprises have had to stop accepting new business as global customers cancel orders. Companies face soaring costs and plunging revenue even as authorities do what they can to jump-start the economy, which was already slowing before the epidemic. “Overall economic activity remains sluggish,” said Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS. Wang added that the next one to two weeks will be crucial, and the epidemic’s actual impact on the economy will depend on how China can balance disease control efforts and resumption of production. The central government, she said, is likely to expand fiscal spending on health care and infrastructure to support recovery and allow higher budget deficit. Idled production lines have sent jitters through global supply chains. Last week, Apple Inc. warned it might miss its revenue guidance for the March quarter because of work slowdowns by suppliers. Foxconn’s Zhengzhou plant alone produces nearly 40% of all iPhones. Foxconn — the world's largest electronics manufacturer with nearly 1 million workers in Shenzhen, Zhengzhou, and other Chinese cities — shut down its factories amid the epidemic. It was not until Feb. 15 that Yao in Hunan and his colleagues across China received word to come back to work. All workers except those at the heart of the epidemic in Hubei province were told to return to factories by Feb. 19. But before they could resume work, most workers were told to stay in remodeled factory dormitories for a 14-day quarantine, according to Yao. “The food is good, with milk and apples,” Yao said, adding that he was pleased with the life in quarantine.  On Feb. 11, Cong Liang, a senior official at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), urged industries “critical to the national economy and people's livelihoods,” to resume work. “Although the restart of business poses a risk of further spreading the virus, continued suspension of production will affect the supply of medical material in the short term and pose shortage risks to people’s livelihood in the long run,” Cong said. “The target of defeating the epidemic will not be reached.” In response to urging from the central government, local authorities have moved to clear the way for business resumption by easing restrictive measures such as traffic bans as well as special government approvals for business operations installed for disease control. Provinces including Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu recently pledged to resume intercity passenger transportation that had been suspended since late January. Other places — including the eastern Jiangxi province and the cities of Chengdu and Hangzhou — have simplified administrative procedures for local businesses to resume operations. Businesses in many parts of the country have reopened since Feb. 10, but the pace of recovery remains slow. Research institutions’ studies based on power consumption, passenger flow, and other indicators showed that only about 30% of migrant workers may have returned to their places of work since the extended Lunar New Year break, and about 40% of industrial production capacity has come back online. China’s coal consumption for nonresidential power generation stands at 56% of its normal amount, according to Zhongtai Securities Co., indicating that less than 60% of overall economic activity has resumed. Zhongtai predicted that a full recovery of the economy will come no earlier than mid-March, given constraints including workforce, transportation, and restrictive local policies.  Staffing Factory Floors Many manufacturers are finding their biggest challenge to be simply staffing factory floors. Data from the Ministry of Transport showed that as of Feb. 14, China’s total passenger turnover after the Lunar New Year break was 283 million trips, down 82.3% from the same period last year. Liu Xiaoming, vice minister of transport, told media Feb. 15 that fewer than 30% of migrant workers who went home for the holiday have returned. Factories are competing to recruit enough workers by offering payments. In Zhengzhou, Foxconn offered workers a 3,000 yuan ($427) bonus to return to posts on time. But a rival company in neighboring Chongqing promised a 4,500 yuan bonus, forcing Foxconn to raise its offer to 5,250 yuan. “At this moment, the company that can quickly gather enough workers to ensure production will win clients,” an industry source said. Some local authorities took early steps to help companies get back on their feet. In eastern China’s economic hub Zhejiang, the provincial government issued guidelines Feb. 3 ordering enterprises to stay closed at least until Feb. 9 while preparing for resumption. Officials in Yiwu, Zhejiang’s merchandise center, quickly approved six companies as the first batch to resume production after reviewing their conditions.  “(The government) meeting was held on (Feb. 3), and we started preparation on (Feb. 5) while informing workers to return,” said Lou Zhongping, chairman of Soton Daily Necessities Co., the world’s largest producer of drinking straws. “Everything was ready around (Feb. 8 and 9).” But the return of enough workers became the biggest challenge, as many localities imposed travel bans. To help people return to work, city and county governments in Zhejiang organized shuttle buses and even charter flights. The Yiwu city government provided subsidies to companies and workers for transit costs. For all that, rounding up enough workers is still difficult, as a large number of migrant workers live in inaccessibly remote countryside locations. Small counties and villages in underdeveloped regions often imposed more aggressive restrictions to prevent people from both leaving and entering for disease control, two Zhejiang factory owners told financial news outlet Caixin. In southern China’s Fujian manufacturing hub Putian, businesses are also struggling to fill factory floors. Many companies offered double pay and free transit to attract workers, while the city government provided living subsidies for workers and businesses. But the “progress of production resumption is not very good,” said a local shoe factory owner.  Balancing Act While encouraging workers to come back, companies found themselves facing imminent challenges to safeguard workers from the virus. Recent COVID-19 infection cases among workers reflected how difficult that could be. One of the most serious cases happened at a mineral unit of Pangang Group in Chongqing. The municipal government disclosed last week that a plant making titanium oxide, a mineral often used as a coloring agent, was shut down completely, idling hundreds of workers, after a cluster of at least three infections occurred at the facility. The closure could cause a huge loss for the plant as a sudden halt of the chemical production line could damage the equipment, an industry analyst said. A long-term closure means the company will have to pay hefty costs for equipment maintenance to resume production on top of workers’ salaries and lost revenues, another industry source said. Risks of the epidemic have forced companies to be prudent in reopening factories. Most of them adopted rolling quarantines for as long as 14 days for returning workers. Fujian New Yifa Paper Products Co., a maker of diapers and hygiene products in Putian, told workers who live in or had visited Hubei and Zhejiang, provinces hit hard by the virus, not yet to return to work. Those from other regions were subject to a 14-day quarantine before going back to work. The company pays for accommodations and catering for returned workers under quarantine in addition to their full salary. The costs for disease control can’t be avoided, said Shen Shengyuan, a senior executive at New Yifa. In Guangzhou, some companies paid for nucleic acid tests, a primary diagnosis method of COVID-19, for workers to ensure safety. Luxvisions, a maker of camera modules, required all workers returning from outside the city to stay in isolation in a designated hotel for three days and then take nucleic acid tests. Workers with a negative test result could resume work. The cost of nucleic acid tests is about 200 yuan per person. So far, about 70% of Luxvisions’ workers have returned, according to Pang Chao, a vice president. An increasing number of companies in southern hub Guangzhou have voluntarily provided the test for their workers, according to a city commercial official. For those companies, the extra cost for prevention measures are less than the costs of a production halt if infection occurs, the official said.  Back on Track According to the NDRC on Feb. 19, more than half of large industrial enterprises in Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other major industrial provinces resumed operations. Data from the Zhejiang provincial government showed that more than 50% of industrial companies and 20% of service companies in the province reopened. But overall business capacity in operation is only one-third of last year’s. Reopening factories is only the first step in companies’ long struggle for business recovery as disrupted supply chains have yet to be restored. “Large companies need supplies from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) while SMEs need supplies from micro businesses,” said Lou of drinking straw-maker Soton. A large number of smaller companies haven’t been able to meet the reopening conditions. Soton faces problems procuring the raw materials it needs from across the country for production, Lou said. On Feb. 18, the Yiwu International Trade City, the world’s largest small-commodity market, reopened with about half of vendors in business. More than 16,000 people visited the market complex during the day. Several vendors at the market, mainly small raw-materials suppliers, said they expect business to fully recover around mid-March. Many manufacturers are under pressure from canceled orders or problems delivering. Lou said some of Soton’s clients in the European Union canceled orders shortly after the outbreak because of safety concerns.  More manufacturers are worried about the effects on their global businesses of unfilled orders and logistics disruptions from the production halt. “Production in January and February is mainly for spring and summer clothing, but (we) can’t make deliveries, and many orders are backlogged,” said a garment manufacturer in Yiwu. New Yifa’s Sheng said the company’s production line for hygiene wipes has remained closed as most workers at key positions live in COVID-19 epicenter Hubei. The company has had to cancel orders with clients and stop accepting new orders. In January, New Yifa sold about 60 million yuan of products to clients in 60 countries. Some local governments have stepped up efforts to help companies counter the risks and bolster the economy. The Putian city government established a special insurance fund to cover companies’ losses related to disruptions. It also provided subsidies to companies to resume by the end of February. Nationwide, the State Council — China’s Cabinet — Feb. 18 announced temporary exemptions of companies’ social insurance contributions, with a total value expected to reach more than 500 billion yuan. The council also granted local governments greater borrowing quotas to spur growth, including an additional 290 billion yuan of special-purpose bonds and an early allocation of 558 billion yuan of general bonds. Experts expect more pro-growth measures to offset the damage from the epidemic. A report published by China Wealth Management 50 Forum, an academic think tank, said China should allow a higher budget deficit ration at 3.5% of GDP to allow more proactive fiscal policies to boost the economy. The report also suggested the issuance of more than 1 trillion yuan of special treasury bonds to fund investments. “As the outbreak fades, the government will gradually release a batch of easing policies to boost investment and consumption,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd. But because of limited policy leeway, Lu said, there is unlikely to be large-scale stimulus after the outbreak.

Epidemic Accelerates China’s Commercial Livestreaming Boom,"With both staff and customers quarantined at home, brick-and-mortar businesses are going online to promote their products to eager viewers.",2020-02-24,"For the past two decades, Sun Laichun’s business acumen has served him well. Unfortunately, circumstances beyond his control have dealt the most crushing blows to his commercial ventures. The 46-year-old is the owner and chief executive of Forest Cabin Cosmetics, a Chinese beauty and skin care brand with over 300 stores nationwide. However, over this year’s Lunar New Year holiday — a time when small- and medium-sized businesses typically rake in a large portion of their annual revenue — nearly half of Sun’s stores have been closed because of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Those that have remained open rarely see customers, leaving him perilously close to declaring bankruptcy. The sting of Sun’s current predicament is especially strong because another coronavirus doomed his previous cosmetics company: In 2003, Sun’s Malaysian business partner put an end to their joint project, failing to see a future in a Chinese market ravaged by SARS.  “The Spring Festival was supposed to be the busiest and most profitable time for us, with the big e-commerce companies suspending their delivery services and consumers having both the time and money to go shopping,” Sun tells Sixth Tone. “But this year, each morning when I open my eyes, I’ve lost 1 million yuan ($142,000). My cash flow will dry up soon. By March, I might be bankrupt.” Amid a rising number of COVID-19 infections, Forest Cabin’s sales had dropped 90% by the end of January. With desperate times calling for desperate measures, Sun logged onto a livestreaming platform, turned on his webcam, and put on the new hat of a yun gui jie, or “cloud beauty adviser.” Livestreaming has been at the center of China’s booming entertainment industry for years, but only recently has it become so commercialized, with the most popular online influencers attracting millions of viewers eager to buy their idols’ promoted products. China’s commercial livestreaming industry reached 433.8 billion yuan in 2019 and is expected to double this year. According to data from financial services firm Zhongtai Securities, the average number of people tuning in to livestreams on Alibaba-owned e-commerce site Taobao increased by 43% over a two-week period ending Feb. 7 , which coincided with tens of millions of people across China being self-quarantined at home. Sun wasn’t exactly new to commercial livestreaming. He had previously collaborated with arguably the biggest name in the business — the “lipstick prince” Li Jiaqi — on several occasions, including for last year’s Singles Day online shopping bonanza. Li’s salesmanship had left Sun slack-jawed: “We provided him with our full stock of 70,000 travel sets, and they sold out in seven seconds.” Yet despite Li’s impressive demonstration of commercial livestreaming’s power, Sun still values bricks and mortar over high-speed internet connections. For him, the face-to-face and hand-to-hand service that takes place in physical shops is irreplaceable. “My dream is to establish a nostalgic, classic brand, and I hope my stores will be centuries old like the ones for historical handcrafted items in Japan,” says Sun. It wasn’t until 2017 that Sun finally gave in to technological temptation and took his business online. Since then, digital sales had come to account for around one-quarter of his company’s total sales. “Everyone knows livestreaming is an emerging e-commerce trend, but we never thought of it as urgent,” Sun says. “The epidemic pushed us to embrace this innovative channel.” For the 470 or so employees Sun enlisted for his new venture, the beginning was rough. At first, Sun’s colleagues, most of whom had little-to-no prior experience with commercial livestreaming, were each only reaching a handful of viewers. When one of them, 30-year-old Zhang Juanjuan, saw that only 13 people were tuning in to watch her livestreams, she couldn’t help but feel upset. “And that was including my father, my mother, my cousins, and my friends!” she tells Sixth Tone with a wry smile. Two months ago, Zhang landed a job as a beauty adviser at a newly opened Forest Cabin store in Jiading, a quiet, residential suburb of Shanghai. Before she was able to develop relationships with frequent customers who might ensure her continued employment, the epidemic hit the city, keeping prospective buyers indoors. Stuck at home herself, Zhang decided livestreaming might be the only way to attract new buyers and meet her sales targets. “With livestreaming, one of my colleagues successfully sold around 10,000 yuan worth of products in several days,” says Zhang, an amount she adds was nearly half of what she had managed to sell in all of January. “So whenever one more person shows up to watch me livestream, I feel more excited and confident,” she says. “As long as I persist, the rising number of viewers will definitely lead to more transactions.”  Forest Cabin is just one of millions of brick-and-mortar businesses to have been severely affected by this year’s unconventional Spring Festival. Intime Department Stores has asked about 50,000 employees to stay home during and after the Lunar New Year and encouraged nearly 1,000 beauty advisers to try their hands at livestreaming until the epidemic blows over. With all 31 provincial-level administrative regions on the Chinese mainland declaring Level 1 emergency responses from late January on, people have been reluctant to leave their homes — if they’re allowed to at all. Many shopping malls, restaurants, cafés, and shops have stayed closed because of the virus. According to a report from business services provider Van Sound Club, around half of the shopping malls on the Chinese mainland are closed, and nearly all the rest have adjusted their hours of operation. Zhu Min, head of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, recently estimated that China’s consumption will decrease by 1.38 trillion yuan in January and February. “If the epidemic were to last for three months, only a few (companies) could survive,” Ding Liye, the senior vice president of Vanke, China’s leading real estate conglomerate, said in an interview earlier this month. “Especially for commercial properties,” Ding continued. “They have to confront a sharp decrease in customers, reduced rent from merchants, and pressure to repay loans.”  Many real estate developers have instituted special policies to reduce the leasing and property management fees paid by their tenants. On Jan. 28, Wanda, which owns over 300 shopping plazas across the country, became the first major developer to announce that it would suspend all such fees for one month beginning Jan. 24, at an estimated cost of over 3 billion yuan. Even enormous efforts like this don’t relieve much of the epidemic’s strain. As more industries seek opportunities online, China’s large internet companies have taken steps to help offline businesses, too. Major livestreaming and e-commerce platforms including Taobao, JD.com, Douyin, Kuaishou, WeChat, and Suning have all lowered entry barriers for merchants looking to take their sales online. Besides cloud beauty advisers, there are now “cloud real estate agents,” “cloud chefs,” “cloud reality shows,” “cloud concerts,” and even “cloud clubbing.” Xiaolongkan, a popular chain of hot pot restaurants, has kept only 57 of its 800 or so shops open over the Lunar New Year holiday — when the company had expected to make 15% of its revenue for the entire year. “Many stores prepared quite a lot of ingredients and food in advance, but now they have to come up with solutions for getting rid of it,” says Bai Jie, who works in Xiaolongkan’s e-commerce department and came up with the idea of “cloud chefs.” On Feb. 16, a Xiaolongkan chef made his first foray into livestreamed cooking, teaching viewers how to enjoy a decent hot pot with their families at home while selling hot pot seasonings and “self-heating hot pots” on the side. In 10 minutes, the chef had sold more than 10,000 self-heating hot pots. “It (livestreaming) has greatly helped our company by relieving the stress of food stocks and funding,” Bai tells Sixth Tone. For internet giants like Alibaba, the epidemic has accelerated the merging of online and offline business. “The concept of ‘cloud chefs’ is to make the public notice the restaurants’ and companies’ efforts to save themselves,” an Alibaba employee who helped plan the cloud chefs campaign tells Sixth Tone. On Valentine’s Day, Sun of Forest Cabin decided to make his solo debut as a commercial livestreamer. Wearing a white shirt and a pair of glasses, he peddled his cosmetic wares for around two and a half hours on Taobao using just a phone, a computer, and a lamp. “There was one comment that read, ‘Look! The boss is livestreaming all by himself to sell products? You should just give up and go bankrupt,’” Sun recalls. Negativity aside, Sun appears to have had the last laugh: During his first livestream, tens of thousands of viewers spent around 400,000 yuan on his company’s products. “Actually, giving up is easy,” Sun says. “I’ve already earned enough money for the rest of my life. I could choose to fire my employees and stop running the business — but I want to fight against the epidemic, and I hope I can survive.” Correction: A previous version of this story used an incorrect surname for the employee from Xiaolongkan’s e-commerce department.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005231
New Study Casts Doubt on Common COVID-19 Treatment,"Shanghai’s leading coronavirus treatment center will no longer prescribe anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, though the study’s own authors say a larger sample size is needed for a conclusive result.",2020-02-24,"The combination of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir is one of the most commonly used clinical treatments for COVID-19 in China, but a recently published review of treatment outcomes has cast doubt on its effectiveness. According to the peer-reviewed study, published Friday in the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases, doctors at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center found that patients who received the two-drug cocktail, sometimes known as Kaletra or Aluvia, did not recover faster than those who were not given antivirals. The study’s authors nonetheless warned that the results were not definitive, citing its small sample size and short duration. A separate, larger World Health Organization-backed clinical trial of the two drugs is still underway in the central city of Wuhan. The results of that trial are expected in three weeks, WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference Thursday. To date, researchers have yet to identify an effective treatment for COVID-19, which has killed over 2,600 and sickened almost 80,000 worldwide. A cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir is one of a number of potential treatment options recommended by China’s National Health Commission in its latest COVID-19 guidelines, updated Feb. 18. This isn’t the first time anti-HIV drugs have been used to treat coronavirus infections — a family that includes SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. A 2004 study by scientists in Hong Kong found that, when taken together, lopinavir and ritonavir resulted in a lower death rate among SARS patients than ribavirin, another antiviral drug. However, that study has been criticized for not including a control group of patients who were not treated with antivirals. Friday’s study, which was run by doctors at SPHCC, included 134 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of these, 52 received a cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir; 34 received abidol, another antiviral recommended by China’s health authorities; and 48 were not given antivirals. After seven days, there was no statistically significant difference in medical outcomes between the three groups, according to the study’s authors. When reached for comment Monday, Lu Hongzhou, the virologist who oversaw the study, told Sixth Tone that the results may not tell the whole story. “We don’t know if the disease outcomes on day 14 will be different (from day seven),” Lu said, while warning that the sample size of 135 was too small to draw any broad conclusions. “More studies need to be done on the long-term effectiveness of these drugs.” In the meantime, Lu says doctors at SPHCC will no longer prescribe lopinavir and ritonavir to patients. According to city regulations, SPHCC’s infectious disease clinic is responsible for treating all adult cases of COVID-19 identified in the city. In addition to the ongoing WHO trial, officials in Japan last week announced they would begin trialling unspecified anti-HIV drugs to treat COVID-19, according to Reuters. Another WHO-backed study in Wuhan, on the effectiveness of Ebola drug remdesivir, is also underway, though it has struggled to meet recruitment goals.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005229
The Invisible Victims of China’s Coronavirus Crisis,Patients at the outbreak’s epicenter with diseases other than COVID-19 are struggling to receive treatment.,2020-02-24,"The day before the central Chinese city of Wuhan went into lockdown, Ye Bing received an ominous message from the hospital where his father-in-law was being treated for tuberculosis: He would have to leave. “They were forcing all of the patients to leave the hospital, saying the government had ordered the wards to be cleared out to treat coronavirus patients,” Ye told Sixth Tone just over a month after Hubei’s provincial capital restricted the movement of some 14 million people to contain the spread of COVID-19. Ye said Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital didn’t even suggest what to do with his father-in-law after he was discharged. They didn’t know which hospital to visit next, or what treatment to seek. The COVID-19 epidemic that originated in Wuhan late last year has choked the city’s health system, killing over 2,600 people and infecting nearly 80,000 worldwide. To cope with the overwhelming number of patients infected with the coronavirus, the city has converted many of its general and specialist hospitals, as well as public venues, into facilities for treating COVID-19 cases.  Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital was one of the first to be repurposed, and there are currently 48 medical facilities in the city that have been designated for treating coronavirus patients. However, with the focus concentrated on containing the epidemic, patients with other diseases say they have struggled to get medical attention, becoming “invisible victims” of COVID-19. After Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital told Ye to make alternative arrangements, he tried to contact other hospitals in the city, but to no avail. Some told him they had run out of beds, while others said they were unable to treat his condition. “We tried everything — calling an ambulance, begging doctors, asking friends and relatives for help, seeking help on social media,” Ye said. “Nothing worked.” With no alternative, Ye took his sick father-in-law home, where he is now hooked up to a respirator. He hasn’t eaten for the past five days, and his condition is deteriorating. “We cannot do anything but wait at home for him to die,” Ye said. “I feel so helpless. I don’t even know what to do if he dies. It’s like there’s no way to live, and there’s no way to die.” Also caught in the coronavirus crossfire are people with HIV. With the ongoing restrictions on movement, many are holed-up in their homes, unable to access antiretroviral therapies that would help them enjoy longer, healthier lives. Huang Haojie, director of the Wuhan LGBT Center, told Sixth Tone that the center has received a flood of messages from concerned individuals. “The sudden lockdown in Wuhan has made it extremely difficult for HIV patients to get medicine,” he said. In China, HIV medications are only accessible in specific hospitals where individuals are registered. Many living with HIV refrain from seeking help from family and friends due to the stigma associated with the disease. “People are afraid of going without the medicine, but they are more afraid of (their disease) being discovered by their family,” Huang said, adding that some people with HIV were visiting their families for the Lunar New Year and are likely still with them. Though China’s National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention temporarily allowed patients to get their monthly dose of HIV medication without registering, Huang said such a “quick response” to the epidemic doesn’t completely address the problem. For many in rural areas, a total shutdown of transportation during the lockdown means they cannot travel to get their drugs. “One HIV patient from the countryside told our center that he set off from his village at 6 a.m. and returned home at 6 p.m. — he walked all day to get the medicine,” Huang said.  Earlier this month, a video of a mother frantically trying to take her daughter out of Hubei for treatment made headlines in China, underscoring the plight of people who feel helpless as they struggle to take care of sick family members. In the video, the woman is seen pleading with police, saying her daughter with leukemia isn’t able to get chemotherapy because of the surge in coronavirus patients. To address the needs of patients other than the ones diagnosed with COVID-19, the Hubei provincial government announced a list of hospitals for such patients last week. The 50 hospitals in Wuhan have been designated for critically ill patients, pregnant women, infants, and those who require dialysis. Li Hua, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy, told Sixth Tone that the coronavirus epidemic has been a “nightmare” for her as she tries to get treatment for her mother, who was diagnosed with late-stage lymphoma in early January. Though the provincial government’s designated hospitals have made it easier to secure a bed at the Hubei Cancer Hospital, she is still uncertain how long they’ll be able to stay there. Before her mother was hospitalized Thursday, Li said they were turned away by two hospitals, both of which had been reserved for coronavirus patients. She’s worried because lymphoma patients need continuous chemotherapy, and her mother may not be able to physically get to the next chemotherapy session. “I don’t know what tomorrow will hold,” said the 26-year-old, who spends much of her time online these days searching for treatment-related information. “You have to depend on yourself. Medical resources are in dire straits.” “I don’t know how long the lockdown is going to last,” she said. “I can only hope our family can get through this period safely.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005230
On Empty Streets: Life as a Wuhan Deliveryman,"With Wuhan under lockdown, its couriers are more important than ever.",2020-02-24,"I come from a small city in China’s central Hubei province. Last July, after some failed investments left me in a load of debt, I moved to the provincial capital of Wuhan to work as a deliveryman. Early last month, I decided to stay in the city for Lunar New Year. During the holiday, delivery companies offer drivers a higher unit price and more orders, as well as cash bonuses worth 6,000 to 7,000 yuan (roughly $850 to $1,000) as long as they keep delivering. It was too tempting for me to pass up: My average monthly take-home pay is just 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Like everyone else in Wuhan, I didn’t think much of the COVID-19 epidemic until Zhong Nanshan revealed the virus could be transmitted between humans on Jan. 20. Things were different the next day. Early that morning, convenience stores suddenly had a deluge of pickup orders. When I read through them, each one included masks. At 5 or 6 that evening, I received an errand order asking me to buy and deliver N95 respirator masks. At the time, I didn’t know what N95s were. I went from pharmacy to pharmacy, but none had any in stock. Thinking that a convenience store I had been to that morning might still have some disposable medical masks, I asked the customer if he wanted those instead, and he said yes. Seeing that everyone had started to take preventative measures, I also bought three boxes for myself.  Less than two days later, at about 2 a.m., Jan. 23, I saw news of Wuhan’s impending lockdown while swiping through my Weibo (social media) feed. My first reaction was that it couldn’t be true. How can you just lock down a big city with more than 10 million residents? Even the city’s public transit was being shut down. But my family and I weren’t too worried. We’d taken care of a family member who had an infectious disease before, so we knew how to protect ourselves. I don’t know how many couriers have left Wuhan. Some might have returned home for the Lunar New Year, others may have left because of the epidemic, and some might have just been staying indoors and not working. Certainly in the three days following Lunar New Year’s Eve, there were very few couriers out and about. I’m part time, however, so I don’t get holiday pay: I have to work to get paid. I change my mask at least twice a day. I also disinfect my scooter with rubbing alcohol and swab my riding gloves with alcohol wipes. The delivery platform has told us how to reduce our risk of infection and requires us to wear masks, disinfect our scooters, and report our physical conditions, including whether we have a fever, every day. In my opinion, the most important thing is keeping a safe distance from others. For example, when delivering meals, I try not to talk to or touch the customer. I carefully arrange the handle of the takeout bag in advance, and when I hand it off I hold it from the bottom. That way customers can easily take it and go, and we don’t need to make physical contact. The platform I work for has also launched a “touch-free delivery” service, through which drivers can leave takeout at the entrance of a compound or apartment building for customers to pick up. After the lockdown, many people on the streets were surprised to see me. “Is anywhere still doing takeout?” they would ask, and I would tell them yes; we can always deliver, and they can always order. To be honest, I’ve been on a sort of high since the outbreak began. Being a courier is usually considered a very low-level job, one which doesn’t require much knowledge or know-how. But now it’s different. It feels like we’re contributing to the city, even if only in a very small way. As long as you see couriers on the street, it’s proof that society is still functioning.  Hospital Bound On the morning of the first day of Lunar New Year, I saw an order placed by someone at Zhongnan Hospital. No one had taken it by the time I was up and dressed, so I did. Zhongnan Hospital has a big campus with 11 buildings. My destination was on the 16th floor of building four. When I arrived, I looked up at the sign: respiratory medicine. Unexpectedly, the hospital was very quiet; it wasn’t crowded like I had imagined it would be. I guess some patients had been transferred to a centralized location somewhere else. Occasionally I passed by a few people wearing masks, but no one looked distressed. The order was placed by an elderly man. He was in an ordinary ward and looked OK to me. I put his package on the chair beside the bed, said “Hello, here’s your takeout,” and left. In the afternoon I received an order for the outpatient department of Wuchang Hospital. It was a large one: There were more than a dozen portions of rice alone, and it filled four big bags. They couldn’t all fit into my scooter’s insulated pack, so I had to tuck some between my legs. I called the number on the ticket when I arrived, but the person who answered said he hadn’t ordered any food and wasn’t at work that day. I contacted the person who placed the order and was sent a new phone number and address — this time for a community health center.  Usually, this kind of thing is extremely irritating, troublesome, and time-consuming. When I arrived at the new address, a young medical worker wearing a mask came out to meet me. I passed him the two bags from between my legs first. Seeming shocked, he thanked me profusely and turned to leave. I stopped him and gave him the other two bags from my pack. “There’s more?” he asked. Judging by his tone, he was pleasantly surprised. I don’t know who placed the order, but I’d guess it was a netizen who wanted to support the city’s doctors and nurses. There’s a popular saying among couriers: “Goddamn it, you’re already a driver: What do you care about some goddamn infectious disease?” The swearing makes it feel real to us, though I don’t know if nondrivers will get the self-mockery in the sentiment: the underlying “How much worse can life get?” But while we may sound tough, most of us are still reluctant to deliver orders to hospitals. A few days ago, I was passing by the gate of Wuchang Hospital when a woman suddenly collapsed. Medical staff rushed to help her and then carried her into the hospital. Everyone I saw seemed calm, from the medics and passersby, to the security guard and the boss of a nearby shop. But I felt like a mountain was pressing down on me. Even away from the hospitals, you can still feel subtle changes in city life. Once, I delivered takeout to a residential area. The woman who picked it up was wearing a mask and coughing. After taking the delivery, she swiped her card and went back into her building. A couple was just behind her, and the man tried to slip in without swiping his own card. The women with him saw this and shouted, “Hey!” Seeing the look in her eyes, the man immediately stopped, and they waited together for some time before going upstairs. Watching them, I wasn’t sure what to think.  Herding Cats After the lockdown, people’s needs changed, and so did their delivery orders. There were fewer takeout deliveries and more people buying rice, noodles, eggs, snacks, and other daily necessities. Near midnight, takeout orders pick up again. I guess with everyone isolated at home, people are going to sleep late, getting up late, and eating more late-night snacks. There are also a lot of orders for medicine. Tamiflu and TCM flu remedies are the most popular. It’s basically impossible to buy masks or disinfectant. Whenever I pass a pharmacy that has some in stock, I buy a bunch to resell in case anyone wants them later on.  Overall, there are still enough daily necessities to go around, and there haven’t been any instances of looting or panic-buying. But vegetables are scarce. Once, a customer asked me to pick up some Chinese cabbage from a supermarket. When I told them the order would be hard to complete, they misunderstood and quickly said they would give me a tip if I procured some. Sure enough, however, when I got to the supermarket, all the leafy greens were sold out — all they had left were potatoes, peppers, and onions. Fortunately, I knew about a small shop that specialized in vegetables, and I was able to buy some there. The shop’s boss told me they were unable to restock their inventory and would have to close the next day. It’s not only people who’ve been affected by the epidemic: Animals have been hit hard, too. On the evening of Jan. 26, I took an errand order to help a woman who wasn’t in Wuhan to check on her cats. She’d been away for four days and couldn’t get back to the city because of the lockdown. I was immediately struck by the stench after opening the door. It was like a biological weapon. I saw some little things lying on the floor, but I couldn’t tell what they were through my fogged-up glasses. At first I assumed they were dead mice, but a closer look revealed them to be dead kittens — one of the woman’s cats had given birth. She cried herself hoarse when I told her.  Another city resident had left his cat, Niangao, at a pet care center before leaving the city, but the cat had somehow escaped. Niangao’s owner put in an errand order asking for someone to help catch the animal, and early one morning three of us deliverymen promised to help. We scoured the 33-story building, before eventually finding the cat on the roof. We tried using dried fish and canned cat food to lure it over, but it didn’t even look our way. We then found a pair of socks and used a wire to fashion them into a rough cat toy, but Niangao only glanced at it. Then he ran through the rooftop access door, all the way down the stairs, and into the next building over. ‘Do we still need to look for it?’ I thought to myself. ‘This goddamn building has 33 floors! I can’t climb another one!’ When we finally caught the cat that afternoon, each of us received a 180 yuan reward. Let’s Go? In a sense, my life now isn’t so different from how it used to be, but the restaurant that I like to eat at is closed and so is the internet café I used to visit every week. I keep hearing people say: “Let’s go, Wuhan!” to show their support for the city. I think that’s too grandiose, and I can’t really relate to it. What I like to think of are all the little, genuine things I’ve seen that have moved me. One night, while riding my scooter, I saw a woman running up ahead of me with a miniature poodle in her arms and three stray dogs chasing after her. When I stopped and asked if she was all right, she said she was. “Thank you,” she added.  Before I could start my scooter to continue on my way, however, she repeated herself, more loudly this time: “Thank you!” People rarely treat me like this. But in this unique time, everyone in Wuhan needs special encouragement and care. I remember the feeling was like having smoke in my eyes: I almost cried. As told to Dong Beiwang.

COVID-19 Highlights Need for Better Infectious Disease Clinics,"With its abundant resources, Shanghai has fared relatively well in the current outbreak — but what about cities that lack the same advantages?",2020-02-21,"It’s been more than a month since prominent epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan publically declared that the novel coronavirus could “definitely” be transmitted between humans, breaking weeks of official complacency about the danger posed by COVID-19 and sending local governments around the country scrambling to identify and quarantine any potential carriers. At least so far, however, the vast majority of the damage has been concentrated at the outbreak’s epicenter. Of the 2,240 deaths linked to COVID-19 in China as of Friday, 2,144 were recorded in the central Hubei province — 1,684 of them in provincial capital Wuhan, where the epidemic is believed to have originated late last year. In the southern Guangdong province, which has the second most reported cases in the country, only five people have died, and no other province has recorded more than 20 deaths. The discrepancy is partly explained by the scale of the crisis in Hubei: By the time local officials finally began warning doctors and the public that the disease could be transmitted between humans, many hospitals were already swamped with more patients than they could handle. But it has also heightened calls for a nationwide network of facilities capable of safely isolating and treating infectious disease cases while minimizing cross-infection risks. Officials in wealthy Shanghai, which has some of the best medical facilities in the country, have recently sought to position the city as an example of what that network might look like. Official protocol in the city calls for all adults who test positive for COVID-19 to be transferred immediately to the 600-bed Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, where they are sorted into one of five treatment groups according to the severity of their condition. SPHCC began operation in October 2004, a little over a year after a devastating SARS epidemic killed over 300 people on the Chinese mainland. Absorbing some of the lessons from that crisis, the center was built with public health emergencies in mind. Located 40 kilometers from the city center and surrounded by 500 acres of woods, SPHCC houses four inpatient buildings with 327 beds fully outfitted with negative pressure systems designed to reduce the risk of airborne transmission by restricting airflow between rooms. “Because we have enough capacity at the moment, we’re putting all patients into negative pressure rooms,” says Lu Hongzhou, a doctor at SPHCC. “Even if they have no symptoms, they are still placed in the rooms to keep them from infecting other people.” According to data from the Shanghai Health Commission, 211 of the city’s 334 confirmed COVID-19 patients have been discharged as of Friday, for a local recovery rate of over 60%. And there have been no cases of medical workers being infected at SPHCC, Lu says. Such facilities remain a relative rarity in China, however. Even in major cities like Wuhan, few hospitals have negative pressure rooms, and over the past month desperate staff have had to cobble together makeshift infectious disease clinics with temporary ventilation equipment or by shutting off their central heating systems and opening windows in sick wards in the middle of winter. Together with a dire shortage of protective gear, these improvised facilities have led to an alarmingly high rate of infection among frontline medical personnel. According to official statistics, 1,716 health care workers had been infected nationwide as of Feb. 11.  Shen Yinzhong, SPHCC’s medical director, says that only a few hospitals in China are equipped with negative pressure rooms, and those that are typically only have one or two such beds. “I’m not claiming that negative pressure rooms are 100% effective or a must-have,” Shen says. “Without them, medical workers are still able to protect themselves while treating patients, but the lack of negative pressure rooms is an indication that most Chinese cities are not fully prepared for a sudden epidemic.” At least some experts and policymakers appear to agree. In a recent op-ed, Huang Qifan, the former mayor of the southwestern city of Chongqing and vice president of the state-run China Center for International Exchanges think tank, argued that China needs to spend between 200 and 300 billion yuan ($28 billion to $48 billion) over the next five years improving its health care system, establishing municipal epidemic prevention systems, and building infectious disease clinics. “Maybe most people would view these (facilities) as wasteful, since we might not need them for years,” Huang notes in his piece. “But they could save us from a once-in-a-century catastrophe.” Even Shanghai might not be prepared for an outbreak of that scale. Although the city has largely been spared the worst of the current epidemic, the few hundred beds at SPHCC are a drop in the bucket for a city of 20 million. The clinic is currently racing to build an additional 200 beds with negative pressure rooms, and city officials are considering opening another epidemic prevention facility in a nearby township. “In terms of epidemic prevention and control, it’s essential to look ahead,” Shen says. “Always prepare for a rainy day.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005225
Officials Dismissed After 505 Prisoners Infected With COVID-19,"Prisons in Hubei, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces have reported clusters of cases, raising concerns over how swiftly the coronavirus spreads.",2020-02-21,"Hundreds of prisoners in several Chinese provinces have tested positive for COVID-19, adding to the number of confirmed cases in the country. As of Friday, a total of 505 inmates from prisons in three different provinces across China — including Hubei, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak — have been diagnosed with the disease, authorities said. In the eastern Shandong province, 200 inmates and seven guards at Rencheng Prison were found to be infected with the virus, the provincial government said Friday. Another 34 prisoners at Shilifeng Prison in the eastern Zhejiang province were also discovered to be infected, according to local officials. Meanwhile, prisons in Hubei have also reported a total of 271 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 230 of them found at a women’s prison in the provincial capital of Wuhan and 41 reported in the city of Jingmen. The warden of the women’s prison in Wuhan, as well as a guard at Jingmen, have been dismissed, according to government officials. Wu Lei, the prison administration director in Shandong, said at a press conference Friday that a guard diagnosed with COVID-19 on Feb. 13 had spread the virus to inmates and other guards. He apologized for the “inadequate implementation of prevention and control measures” and added that the inmates from the prison had been transferred to hotels for quarantine. The inmates who tested positive are being treated, and epidemiologists are working to trace the source of the infections, according to Shandong authorities. The provincial government also said that eight officials, including the prison warden, had been dismissed. In Zhejiang, the inmates at Shilifeng were said to be infected by a prison guard with a history of travel to Wuhan, according to the provincial government. The guard, surnamed Luo, had left for a five-day family visit on Jan. 14 and had resumed working in the prison after returning, without disclosing his travel history. The warden of the Zhejiang prison was also dismissed Friday. None of the inmates from the three provinces are in serious condition, and no deaths have resulted, China’s prison bureau said Friday. Over 2,200 people in China have died from the COVID-19 epidemic, mostly in Hubei. The virus has also infected more than 77,000 people worldwide, as more countries are starting to see outbreak clusters. In South Korea, 39 new infections in the city of Daegu were said to be linked to a religious sect, raising fears of a community outbreak. Meanwhile, over 20 people linked to a church in Singapore were also found to be infected with the virus. With 621 confirmed cases, the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan since Feb. 3 has the most coronavirus patients of any place outside the Chinese mainland. In China, 83% of the cluster cases have occurred in families, while other mass infections have occurred in hospitals, schools, shopping malls, and factories, the National Health Commission revealed after analyzing over 1,000 such cases. Earlier this month, more than 80 patients and medical workers at the Wuhan Mental Health Center were also diagnosed with COVID-19.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005226
China’s Beekeepers Feel the Sting of COVID-19 Epidemic,The novel coronavirus and the movement restrictions being enforced to contain it are bad news for bees.,2020-02-21,"The novel coronavirus that had killed over 2,100 people in China as of Thursday is also gradually claiming another victim: China’s beekeeping industry. In a notice Feb. 15, the country’s top beekeeping body, the Apicultural Science Association of China, mourned the death of a beekeeper who reportedly killed himself after all of his bees died of starvation in the southern Yunnan province, as local travel restrictions had made it impossible to buy feed for the colony or relocate it to an area where they could feed naturally. To control the spread of the coronavirus, regions across China have imposed strict restrictions on the movement of vehicles and people, including sealing off roads and implementing approval systems for interregional transportation. Some “hardcore” containment measures have also include shutting down public spaces and barring residents from leaving their homes, sometimes literally. But the epidemic prevention measures have also stopped many beekeepers — including the late Liu Decheng — from moving their colonies to new nectar sources to keep them nourished, according to the apicultural association. “The bees are chasing flowers and honey,” Wang Jianmei, the association’s deputy general secretary, told Sixth Tone. “Many flowers in Yunnan are gone now, so he (Liu) had to move the bees to other areas — otherwise they were going to starve.” With the flowers near his colony not yielding sufficient nectar and many of his bees poisoned with pesticide, Liu was unable to keep his 100 or so beehives nourished after attempts to buy feed and relocate them were thwarted by local virus containment measures, Wang said. Liu has two children and is the primary breadwinner for his family of six in Xichang, a rural area of the southwestern Sichuan province. After his death, some of his fellow beekeepers launched fundraising campaigns to help provide for his family, according to Wang. China’s central government has implored local authorities not to impose extreme controls on transportation channels in the name of epidemic containment. Since Feb. 15, bees and other “life necessities” including feed ingredients, poultry, livestock, and aquatic products have been eligible for a special green transport channel, according to an official guideline. But the policy came too late for Liu. The 45-year-old was declared dead by local police in Yimen County on Feb. 13, an official surnamed Li from Liu’s neighborhood committee told Sixth Tone. According to a leaked photo purportedly of Liu’s death certificate, his body was found at an apiary. A team has been assembled to investigate the beekeeper’s death, a spokesman surnamed Bai from the county publicity department told Sixth Tone. China has over 9 million managed bee colonies, making it the world’s largest beekeeping industry. In 2018, the country exported 542,500 tons of honey. According to Wang, even after the green channel policy came into effect, some villages and townships were still taking hardline positions on people’s movements, presenting potential headaches for beekeepers attempting to carry on an already-precarious tradition. Zhang Ming, a beekeeper in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the central Hunan province, told Sixth Tone that because of the epidemic, he is now keeping his bees mainly in one place, even though this may affect the quality of their honey. “Beekeeping is hard,” the 35-year-old said. “This year it’s especially hard.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005217
Scan-Reading AI Systems Are Helping Doctors Diagnose COVID-19,"One company says its system can detect viral pneumonia with 99% accuracy, but experts are skeptical of a similar product from Alibaba that claims to diagnose COVID-19 specifically with 96% accuracy.",2020-02-20,"Artificial intelligence is helping China’s medical workers read COVID-19 patients’ radiographic imaging in seconds rather than minutes. With higher processing speeds and calculation abilities, these machines can reduce doctors’ workloads and dramatically speed up the diagnostic process, experts say. “AI can reduce the time we spend analyzing a case by half,” said Shan Fei, a senior radiologist at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. “But doctors will still be the ones making the diagnostic decisions.”  According to the current national guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19, chest scan results are a key diagnostic marker. The CT scans of infected patients often show shadows over their lungs, a phenomenon called ground-glass opacity. Based on the size and position of these shadows, doctors can tell how far the disease has progressed. But reading the scans isn’t always straightforward. Each patient might have 300 to 400 scans, Shan told Sixth Tone, and analyzing them might take up to 10 minutes. Moreover, the process relies heavily on a doctor’s experience because they have to eyeball the proportion of shadow relative to lung tissue for lack of a better tool, Shan said. “During this epidemic, AI has been helping us evaluate disease progression and recovery,” Shan said. “It can also discover minor pathological changes in the lungs at very early stages of the disease.” Since the beginning of the outbreak, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center has collaborated with Yitu Technology, a locally based tech company, to develop an AI-equipped diagnostic assistant called the Intelligent Evaluation System of Chest CT for COVID-19. Yitu has been working on an AI system for diagnosing lung cancers and tuberculosis using CT scans, according to Fang Cong, vice president of Yitu Healthcare’s product team. So it took the company only a few days to build the pneumonia evaluation system and train it with COVID-19 data from the clinical center.  The system was rolled out at the center on Jan. 28. After letting it learn by processing a week’s worth of extra data and receiving initial feedback, Yitu distributed the system to several hospitals in Wuhan, including Wuhan Union Hospital and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, two of the designated facilities for treating COVID-19. “Radiologists, especially those at the epicenter, are reading thousands of scans every day,” Fang told Sixth Tone. “One of their priorities is to quickly identify those who are in critical condition, and our system can do that in three seconds. As we’re continuing to receive data and feedback from doctors, the system is becoming more sensitive and more accurate.”  Reading CT scans isn’t a challenging task for an AI system, and it’s possible to train one within a very short period of time, according to Yang Yang, an AI expert at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. “There’s a lot of research in the field of computer vision, so it’s a relatively mature technology,” Yang told Sixth Tone. “If you have a large amount of data, it’s not impossible to train and develop a system that can read scans more accurately than doctors can.” Yitu isn’t the only company that has created a scan-reading AI system. According to Shan, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center is also using another system developed by United Imaging, a local tech company. Shan said he and the team are still comparing the two systems to see which works better. While Fang says Yitu’s system can achieve 99% accuracy in detecting viral pneumonia, tech and e-commerce giant Alibaba claims that its own scan-reading AI can diagnose COVID-19 specifically with 96% accuracy. However, experts are skeptical of such a high accuracy rate for COVID-19 pneumonia, as it has yet to be supported with evidence. “COVID-19 is one type of viral pneumonia,” Gong Xiangyang, a radiologist at Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, told Sixth Tone. “So on CT scans, COVID-19 can look identical to other kinds of pneumonia, such as the flu. We can’t diagnose patients based on CT scans alone — we have to analyze the case using scans, epidemiological evidence, and nucleic acid tests. This 96% sounds like a PR gimmick.” Alibaba had not responded to Sixth Tone’s interview request by time of publication.   The surge in AI products for fighting the novel coronavirus followed a Feb. 4 proposal from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology that urged AI organizations and companies to supply products capable of assisting national epidemic prevention and control efforts. Two weeks later, the Shanghai AI Development Alliance on Feb. 16 published a list of nearly 300 AI systems that companies had suggested to support medical staff and help fight the virus, including cleaning robots, temperature-screening systems, and health chatbots. “Technology is a double-edged sword,” Gong said. “I’m glad to see how much it’s helping doctors during this crisis. But we shouldn’t rely on it too much, as some of our younger doctors are already doing. It’s like how we got so used to navigation apps that we no longer trust our own judgement. Machines, as powerful as they are, still make mistakes — and the mistakes here are human lives.” (Header imag: An AI system is used to analyze CT scans at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Feb. 6, 2020.

Reality Shows Present Slice of Indoor Life During Epidemic,"Several television and online platforms are premiering shows shot within the confines of people’s homes, including those of celebrities.",2020-02-20,"China’s reality shows have been given a twist as they broadcast the reality of having to stay indoors during the novel coronavirus epidemic. The new virtual trend — aptly known as “cloud variety shows” — takes place in the living rooms of celebrities and lay-participants who sing, dance, and eagerly await their time in the spotlight. Several television and online platforms including Hunan TV, iQiyi, Tencent Video, and Youku have hopped on the bandwagon, launching nearly a dozen reality shows filmed remotely. On Tuesday, Hunan TV’s hit reality show “Singer” showed scenes of celebrity guests filming themselves individually from their studios or homes. In a preview of the next episode, scheduled to air Friday, singers are seen on conference call split screens, waiting for their turn to perform. Hunan TV, one of China’s biggest state-owned television networks, has launched two new reality shows documenting the lives of celebrities amid the COVID-19 epidemic. As many as 780 million people are said to be under some form of travel restrictions, and millions of others are either holed up at or working from home as authorities try to contain the spread of the virus that has killed more than 2,100 in China and infected over 75,000 globally. “Hey, What Are You Doing?” is one of Hunan TV’s weekly programs in which the show’s three hosts video chat with their celebrity friends about their time indoors. In the style of a vlog, they’re seen cooking, interacting with friends and family, and working out. Song Zhuo’er, a 23-year-old resident in the locked-down city of Enshi, Hubei province, is a fan of the novel format. In one episode, the show’s host, Li Weijia, plays an interactive game with his mother, which Song later tried out with her father during their self-quarantine. “But (the show) must have someone who knows how to keep conversations going, otherwise it would be so awkward,” she told Sixth Tone, referring to the quotidian settings. Streaming platforms iQiyi, Youku, and Tencent Video have introduced similar shows to entertain the millions who are stuck indoors. On Monday, iQiyi aired the first episode of “Karaoke Table at Home” featuring singers who take requests from virtual audience members before the show and then sing them on the air. Since Feb. 8, Youku’s daily reality show “Eat Well” has been inviting different celebrities to livestream what they cook and eat for lunch. “The food itself is not that important, even if they only make a bowl of instant noodles or a sandwich,” Zheng Wei, general manager of Youku’s variety shows division told China Youth Daily. “The most important thing in this process is a sense of empathy and reality.” Tencent Video premiered its new show “Good Time at Home” on Monday. The daily program features celebrities livestreaming while interacting with the audience in real time. “The show has celebrities and topics that young people like — it’s in line with the needs of the audience,” the show’s production team told Sixth Tone in a written statement. “Celebrities are filming at home — in their kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms. The scenes allow them to express themselves in a more relaxed way, while making the audience feel close and connected.” Eyeing the success of these new reality shows, more-established programs are also preparing to embrace similar formats. On Tuesday, “Street Dance of China” said it had started to host online auditions for its latest season to avoid the public health risk of having hundreds of thousands of people gather at venues across the country. Now, participants are simply required to submit videos of them dancing, filmed at home. Zheng of Youku remains optimistic about the new format the entertainment industry is exploring. He believes that, in spite of the challenges, this is a time for innovation. “These extraordinary conditions now pose an extreme challenge for the industry — they interrupt original plans, but they also inspire new ideas,” Zheng told China Youth Daily. “Innovation made during this time might even give birth to new norms in the future.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005218
"Why Patent Laws Matter, Even in Times of Crisis","The Wuhan Institute of Virology came under fire this month after trying to patent the use of a drug it didn’t develop. It overlooked a better, less legally fraught method already on the books.",2020-02-20,"On Jan. 21, Chinese researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology filed for a patent on the use of experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19. Normally, this might be cause for celebration: COVID-19, a deadly pneumonia-like disease caused by a novel coronavirus, has killed over 2,000 and sickened 70,000 more worldwide since last December, sending researchers scrambling to develop an effective treatment. The thing is, the Wuhan Institute of Virology didn’t develop remdesivir: The drug was researched, produced, and patented by Gilead Sciences, a California-based pharmaceutical company; and the institute’s decision to claim exclusive rights over an unproven use of the drug in the midst of a rapidly escalating health crisis was heavily criticized. Given the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic, one would expect a virology institute located at its epicenter to devote resources toward containing the spread of the underlying virus or perhaps researching new therapies and vaccines — not toward patenting new uses for drugs it neither developed nor tested. Though legally admissible, the institute’s decision to seek a patent in this case is ethically questionable and may have a negative impact on China’s public health and medical research cooperation efforts. In response to the public outcry, the Wuhan Institute of Virology defended its patent application by claiming it was made in the nation’s interest. It added that it would be willing to forgo enforcing its patent rights if foreign pharmaceutical companies — in this case, Gilead Sciences — would collaborate with Chinese authorities to stop the epidemic. But this argument is weak. If the institute was really only concerned about public health and access to vital drugs in an emergency, they could have used a mechanism already in place that gives countries flexibility with intellectual property in just such an event: compulsory licenses. While controversial, compulsory licenses allow eligible drugmakers to legally manufacture and sell copycat versions of patented drugs during national emergencies, public health crises, or other instances of extreme need. As a form of compensation for the original patent holder, the competent authority — in China’s case, the National Intellectual Property Administration — would require manufacturers to pay a “fair market price” for the drug. Compulsory licences are explicitly allowed under Articles 48-50 of Chinese patent law, although the country has yet to issue one, and are in line with the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS Agreement, which outlines global standards for protecting intellectual property rights. Where they’ve been granted, they have led to significant reductions in drug prices. In 2012, for example, Indian generic drugmaker Natco Pharma was granted a compulsory licence for Sorafenib, an anticancer drug, after that country’s patent office ruled Bayer AG, Sorafenib’s patent holder, had not done enough to make the drug available to Indian citizens. Natco Pharma was required to pay 6% royalties to the German company — a figure based on UN guidelines — and proposed selling its version for 97% off Bayer’s price. Given the scale of the ongoing health crisis, a Chinese company filing for a compulsory licence would not necessarily be perceived as an attempt to unjustifiably circumvent Gilead Sciences’ patent rights. But the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s highly unusual strategy — seeking to patent an untested use of a drug in a way that might interfere with patent protections owned by a foreign corporation — has raised hackles. Some critics have accused the institute of trying to get out of paying Gilead Sciences a licencing fee should a compulsory license be granted. Others have read its move as an attempt to secure potential bargaining chips in upcoming pricing negotiations with the company. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not the only Chinese entity whose actions have come under scrutiny from patent advocates. Suzhou-based BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology may also be in for a fight after reporting that it had synthesized remdesivir’s active ingredient without first obtaining permission from the patent holder. Though the company says it’s interested in setting up a voluntary licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences at some point in the future, it also claims that its work hasn’t infringed upon that company’s patent rights, because the final product is not being sold on the market. This is highly debatable. Indeed, under both international and national patent laws, manufacturing a patented medicine, even if it’s not yet on sale, still amounts to patent infringement. There are real risks to the strategies adopted by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and BrightGene. In particular, they may raise international companies’ suspicions regarding their Chinese peers. This in turn may hamper vital research cooperation between China and other countries. Gilead Sciences, for example, has offered samples of remdesivir for use in clinical trials during the current outbreak. Other leading international pharmaceutical firms currently working on vaccines for COVID-19, like Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline, may have less incentive to do so in the future if they believe China will not support their intellectual property claims. Intellectual property laws are generally grounded on two core principles. One is egoistic in nature and affirms the right of creators to profit from their work. The other, less obvious one is altruistic insofar as it aims at establishing favorable conditions for collaboration and exchange, thereby speeding up the process of scientific discovery. It is often difficult to balance these two opposing forces, but in this case, it would seem both the Wuhan Institute of Virology and BrightGene have put profit over societal well-being. Such actions risk undermining China’s recent work enhancing IP protection, including enforcement, which is crucial if the country is to attract more foreign commercial investment. Thus, it may be better if the two can reach a fair settlement with Gilead, and if the institute were to clarify it is not seeking to use its patents as leverage over the American company. Intellectual property protections must be managed with great care, as well as a willingness to occasionally set aside financial considerations in favor of ethical or moral concerns. International intellectual property laws are far from perfect and may very well require adjustment or reform. The solution, however, is not to erode the mutual trust required to make international public health cooperation work.

Chinese Students Worried Over Foreign University Deadlines,International exams for language proficiency and specific graduate paths have been canceled in China because of the coronavirus epidemic.,2020-02-19,"Several tests required for gaining admission to Western universities have been canceled in China amid the COVID-19 epidemic, casting doubt on many Chinese students’ plans to continue their education abroad. Major exams such as the International English Language Testing System, Teaching of English as a Foreign Language, Graduate Record Examinations, and Graduate Management Admission Test — IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, and GMAT, respectively — have been canceled on the Chinese mainland through the end of March. All tests scheduled for February were also canceled due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 75,000 globally. Several students whose February and March test appointments were affected said dates for exams scheduled after March were already booked when they rushed to secure a different time slot. Muzi, a 22-year-old student from Beijing, said she hopes to book a new GRE date for April. However, she would still miss the deadlines for five of the eight U.S. universities where she was planning to apply to study electrical engineering. “I’m waiting to see when I can take the test — the sooner the better,” Muzi, who asked to use a pseudonym, told Sixth Tone. “That, or I’ll have to wait for next year’s spring or fall admission.” Many students who plan to study in the U.S. or the U.K. have received conditional admission letters that allow them to matriculate only if they obtain certain scores on language proficiency tests such as the IELTS or TOEFL. Claudia Wang, a partner at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, told Sixth Tone that while the cancelations will impact students applying for the summer program or fall semester, prospective 2021 students should have enough time to take the tests they need. But many students are still concerned. Liu Lixuan is a 24-year-old data analyst in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the epidemic. He plans to apply for graduate schools in the U.S. for next year and was hoping to finish his TOEFL and GRE exams before July. Now, his self-imposed deadline is looking grim. “For those who haven’t received their TOEFL and GRE results, the sooner they get the grades, the better, because delaying applications means fewer choices,” he told Sixth Tone. Universities in the U.S. have yet to announce plans or policies addressing these concerns. Muzi said she inquired at her prospective universities but hasn’t received a response. Another 22-year-old student from Hefei in the eastern Anhui province also said he is awaiting responses from eight universities in the U.S. The student, who wished to be identified as Eric, told Sixth Tone that he has submitted all the required documents for attending an American university in the fall except for what he hopes will be a higher GRE score. “The impact will be quite significant if I can’t take the test in April,” he said, adding that he still hopes to meet the mid-May deadline for his dream school. Universities in the U.K., including King’s College London, University of Warwick, and University of Leeds, have announced various measures to help students meet their English proficiency requirements. While some have extended their deadlines for providing the test results, others have proposed alternative tests. However, the three British universities Chen Meixi applied to have yet to offer extended deadlines. The Chengdu-based student said she has to submit her IELTS score by June. Her test date in March was canceled, but she has successfully secured a date in May. “Many people (fellow students) have messaged me asking if I would like to go to Vietnam or South Korea in April to take the test, and some also asked if I wanted to try to take another test such as the PTE (Pearson Language Tests), which has more slots now,” she said. Wang from Oliver Wyman suggested that students consider smaller Chinese cities with fewer applicants for future test dates, adding that some exam providers like the British Council are scheduling extra slots to accommodate the demand. “We don’t think there will be a mid- or long-term impact,” Wang said. “Given this gap period, they (students) may study online, start preparation for other tests, or work on extracurricular activities, which are also important in the application process.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005208
"105 People Were Infected With COVID-19 by Dec. 31, Study Says","From an analysis of over 72,000 coronavirus cases, researchers from the Chinese CDC determined there were serious delays in detecting and reporting infections in the early stages of the epidemic.",2020-02-19,"The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has published the most comprehensive epidemiological analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic to date, revealing that less than 5% of infections in the central Hubei province were detected and reported during the early stages of the outbreak. The study — titled “The Epidemiological Characteristics of an Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19)” — analyzed all 72,314 cases reported by Feb. 11, including over 44,000 confirmed cases, 16,000 suspected cases, 10,000 clinically diagnosed cases, and around 900 cases of positive tests without symptoms. The new research was published Monday in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology (in Chinese) and China CDC Weekly (in English). According to the National Health Commission’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines, a “confirmed case” requires a positive nucleic acid test, while a “clinically diagnosed case” is a special classification that was added to the fifth edition of the guidelines and applies only to Hubei. This category is defined as a symptomatic patient whose radiographic imaging indicates pneumonia, without a positive nucleic acid test. Some of the findings from the study are consistent with what is already known about the novel coronavirus. The research team determined that the virus is highly contagious, having spread from a single city to the entire country in just one month, and despite authorities’ extreme containment efforts, including citywide lockdowns. In addition, they found that COVID-19 is not life-threatening for over 80% of patients, and that older patients with preexisting health conditions are more likely to die. The retrospective study also reveals significant delays by Wuhan and Hubei officials in identifying and reporting cases, especially during the early stages of the outbreak. For example, the analysis found that over 5,500 of Hubei’s confirmed cases might have fallen ill before Jan. 20. Officially, however, the provincial health commission had reported just 270 confirmed cases by this date, suggesting a diagnosis rate of less than 5%. The study also said that 105 infections had occurred before Dec. 31 — the date Wuhan’s health commission first acknowledged an “unexplained illness” in just 27 patients. With the large amount of data, researchers for the first time were able to construct epidemic curves, useful tools in understanding how the virus spread. According to the curves, the cases from December all seemed to share a common source: the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. But from early January, the virus became a propagated epidemic, meaning the first wave of infected people had gone on to infect others. A previous epidemiological study also led by the China CDC had analyzed just the first 425 confirmed COVID-19 cases. That research — which suggested that the virus was being passed between people as early as mid-December — was published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Jan. 29, just over a week after Chinese health officials finally admitted the reality of human-to-human transmission on Jan. 20. The curves also showed that the number of confirmed infections increased dramatically in mid-January and peaked sometime between Jan. 24 and Jan. 28. Since the beginning of this month, the number of new cases identified each day has been steadily decreasing. However, the authors warned of a possible resurgence in COVID-19 cases as hundreds of millions of people return to work and school in the coming weeks. “We must remain vigilant, hone our skills, fund our defenses, and practice our responses,” the authors wrote.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005213
Head-Shaving Video’s ‘Self-Sacrifice Rhetoric’ Sparks Backlash,"Women should not be used as propaganda tools in the fight against the coronavirus, critics say.",2020-02-19,"A video of female medical workers crying while having their heads shaved has sparked backlash on Chinese social media, with netizens slamming it as a shameful attempt to channel the sacrifices of the country’s frontline medical staff to serve a political purpose. In the now-deleted video first published by local media, 14 female staff from the Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child Care Hospital are seen having their heads shaved before being dispatched to Hubei province and the front lines of the novel coronavirus epidemic.   Because short hair is believed to be more practical for anyone wearing protective headgear or a hazmat suit all day, some hospitals have provided haircuts for their doctors and nurses by enlisting the services of volunteer barbers. However, because some of the women in the head-shaving video are visibly crying, netizens have questioned whether they consented to the procedure, or whether it was forced upon them. On social app WeChat, a scathing commentary titled “Please Stop Using Women’s Bodies as Propaganda Tools” has been viewed over 100,000 times, the maximum number the app displays. “It is understandable that the frontline situation is hard and having long hair may be inconvenient, but is there really no better solution? Why don’t you just let them choose a short hairstyle that they want?” the article said. “Their tears were used to reach an audience. … I guess that’s what the publicity officials want.” When reached by phone Tuesday, a staff member from the hospital’s publicity department declined to comment, and calls to the leader of the medical aid team went unanswered.  Cai Bozheng, a barbershop owner in the southern city of Haikou, told Sixth Tone that he and his staff have given haircuts to over 1,000 medical workers who were on their way to Hubei province to assist with the COVID-19 treatment and containment efforts. Not one woman asked to have her head completely shaved, the barber said. “Yesterday, some of the female medical workers told me they thought they might need to shave their heads and asked me whether they would have to cry like those women in the news did,” Cai said. “I told them there was no need — that in addition to not shaving their heads, we would give them beautiful short hairstyles.” Cai said that although long hair can be inconvenient for working on the front lines, he believes completely shaving heads is unnecessary. Instead, he and his staff have come up with several short hairstyles for the female medical workers to choose from.  Sun Baihui, a researcher at Communication University of China in Beijing, believes this kind of publicity stunt demonstrates a failure to apply media ethics. People’s criticism of the video isn’t only about the women’s heads being shaved, but also about them being used to achieve an ideological goal, she said. “In the beginning, we were touched by these stories because they were authentic and real,” Sun told Sixth Tone. “The problem is, after those videos, our media started seeking out those kinds of stories, which completely changed their nature.” Sun also believes such videos point to a bigger problem. The real issue, she says, is the patriarchal logic behind the “self-sacrifice rhetoric” that some Chinese media outlets are so eagerly appropriating. “Some of our media really like the ‘self-sacrifice’ trope … with the logic being the use of sacrifice to make the aim seem noble,” Sun said. “The video suggests the most important value for a woman is her hair — which symbolizes beauty and sex appeal — rather than her professional capacity as a medical worker.” This is not the first case of female frontline medical workers being treated inappropriately. Last week, Sixth Tone wrote about hospitals and health authorities overlooking women’s needs for feminine hygiene products, and there have also been reports of pregnant women being summoned to Hubei, as well as frontline women being given progesterone to delay menstruation.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005207
"Online Classes Get Mixed Reactions From Students, Teachers","As students in urban areas complain of slow internet connections, many in remote places are finding it difficult to log into their courses at all.",2020-02-18,"Update: On March 2, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a notice urging domestic telecom companies to improve network coverage in rural areas and offer discounted data plans to students from low-income households. Millions of Chinese students are starting a new school term not in their classrooms, but in front of their computers. Weeks after schools delayed the spring semester due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, China’s education ministry in late January ordered institutions to continue administering coursework online. Daily activities including flag-raising ceremonies, roll calls, and lectures are now conducted virtually. Wang Lufeng, an associate professor of food science at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the epidemic, told Sixth Tone that he has been livestreaming lessons to his 62 students. To get a better signal in his rural hometown in the eastern Shandong province, the professor said he has to lecture from his roof. “It’s normal,” Wang said. “A majority of teachers in our school have started to give online courses.”  But an increase in demand for livestreaming and other online education services is causing app crashes and other internet disruptions, with several related hashtags including “Tecent Classroom crashed” trending on microblogging platform Weibo. “I wait from 8 a.m. until noon, feeling like a century has passed,” a college student complained on Weibo, referring to frequent disruptions during live lectures. Many online education platforms including Rain Classroom, Superstar Study System, and China University MOOC apologized for poor service on Monday, naming the surge in users as the chief cause. “The number of concurrent online users on the platform is about 10 times higher than usual, resulting in system overloads and platform instability,” China University MOOC wrote on Weibo. The education platform recommended that students log in during non-peak hours when possible. With distance learning on the rise, education experts are questioning whether online courses are necessary for everyone, from primary schoolers to university undergrads. “Students require autonomous learning abilities for online education,” said Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a Beijing think tank. “Meanwhile, spending too much time online could affect students’ eyesight, and is not conducive to the cultivation of their learning habits.” For many students, access to computers and the internet has also posed challenges for continuing online classes. A student surnamed You at Anhui Agricultural University told Sixth Tone that she hasn’t been able to take classes regularly due to a spotty internet connection at her home in rural Fujian province, and because using cellular data is “extremely expensive.” “It’s hard to take online classes in a rural village,” You said. “Broadband connections aren’t common here. Not every family has a smartphone.” Xiong told Sixth Tone that online courses cannot reduce the educational divide between urban and rural areas — and in fact may even be counterproductive. “In addition to poor rural internet access, rural children more importantly lack sufficient family supervision and guidance,” he said. “Providing them with online resources doesn’t mean that they will learn. The gap between urban and rural children may even widen.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005205
Epidemic Leaves China’s Already-Frail Small Businesses Gasping for Air,"The country’s small- and medium-sized businesses are being hit hardest by the coronavirus, and experts worry that delayed work could have a lasting impact on the domestic economy.",2020-02-18,"Zhang Liang’en, the owner of a home appliances sales company in southern China’s Guangdong province, had a roller coaster of a Monday. It began with the frustrating realization that his business might not qualify to resume work because it did not have enough face masks on hand to meet a strict local approval standard. As China apprehensively returns to work after an unusually long Lunar New Year holiday, concerns over the COVID-19 epidemic — which by Tuesday had killed over 1,800 people in the country and infected more than 72,000 worldwide — are presenting unresolved obstacles for businesses hoping to resume their normal operations, with small- and medium-sized firms especially vulnerable to a protracted crisis. The central government has suggested that businesses may be “held accountable” if their employees contract the coronavirus at work. Before businesses could open Monday morning, the government of Zhongshan, where Zhang’s company is based, asked them to prepare enough health supplies — disinfectant and face masks, among other items — to pass a required inspection and ensure safe working spaces for their employees, according to Zhang.  But face masks and disinfectant products are in short supply and difficult to buy in bulk. Given that Zhang’s business could be unable to reopen without these essential items, his 15 or so employees face an existential threat. “(We) had originally planned to resume work on Feb. 1, then get new stock shipments one after another from mid-February,” Zhang told Sixth Tone. “Now, our ‘food’ is about to run out.” Before Zhang could sort out how to appease the inspectors, however, the authorities had a change of heart: That afternoon, he was informed that the approval requirements had been relaxed, meaning he would be able to open his shop after all. With the go-ahead secured, Zhang is hurriedly making arrangements to resume operations, though there is some uncertainty about whether his suppliers will also be permitted to start working again. Zhang has other lingering concerns, too. Crippled logistics networks have resulted in a shortage of raw materials, and with many city governments in China still restricting people’s movements to varying degrees, small- and medium-sized companies like his that don’t have substantial reserves of products to sell are left to fend for themselves. “Even if you find another supplier, it’s useless because the logistics networks are disrupted,” Zhang said.  Many small businesses in China are facing similar predicaments. In a survey of 1,079 domestic companies published Saturday on social app WeChat, researchers from Tsinghua and Peking universities found that small firms and startups were most at risk during the COVID-19 epidemic. And over 80% of small companies — which the poll defined as having with less than 300 million yuan ($42.8 million) in total assets — said they expected to generate less revenue in 2020 than in the previous year due to the current challenges. While essential and state-dominated sectors like energy have largely gone back to work, local governments’ restrictive reopening policies for private businesses have left some owners unsure of their next steps. Smaller firms in industries that rely on a floating labor force — China’s millions of migrant workers — have found it particularly hard to resume operations. Some cities and villages have imposed so-called hardcore quarantine measures aimed at containing the virus, from shutting down public spaces and putting up roadblocks to barring nearly all residents from leaving their homes. Such draconian policies have only made it harder for people to return to their regular jobs.  Shen Chaowen, who owns a home appliances manufacturing company in Lianjiang, another city in Guangdong, doesn’t know when he’ll be able to reopen his business. He has asked his 130 or so employees to remain in their hometowns until further notice and is worried the current situation won’t remain tenable for long. “It’d be best to start back up at the end of this month — otherwise we won’t be able to afford our turnover,” Shen told Sixth Tone, referring to raw materials and other expenses. Shen’s company is a rising star in Lianjiang, with its products exported as far as Brazil. But his business has been completely disrupted by the epidemic. With work undone and cargo undelivered, Shen has been forced to ask his business partners to let him delay delivery on their orders until March. Shen is also negotiating with his employees, most of whom are still at home, to be paid reduced salaries for at least a month.  “Yeah, I’m worried — it’s impossible not to be,” Shen said. “But worrying doesn’t help. All you can do now is wait and talk patiently with the government.” For China’s private firms, tight cash flow is a constant concern, and the COVID-19 epidemic has only exacerbated this problem. More than 40% of private companies don’t have the financial resources to last longer than three months without continued income, according to a survey published Monday by the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. The survey found that, on the other hand, more than half of China’s state-owned enterprises could survive solely off of their coffers for over a year. To ease the cash crunch on businesses, the Lianjiang government is allowing them to defer payment of their taxes and utilities until further notice, and banks have granted business owners like Shen a grace period on interest rate payments. “Of course this helps a lot,” Shen said. “When you can’t resume business, where is the money to pay the bills?” Shen’s suppliers of raw materials like steel plate are also hoping his company will open its doors soon. “The upstream suppliers are all looking at us. When we start, they can start,” he said.   China is the world’s leading consumer and manufacturer of home appliances, and small- and medium-sized companies like Zhang’s and Shen’s prop up the highly competitive sector. According to market research firm Gartner, the major consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic in China — labor and raw material shortages, restrictions on travel and logistics, and less-positive consumer demand — could impact the global supply chain. Experts are also worried about the epidemic’s potential ripple effects on China’s economy, as interconnectivity brings inherent risks to the supply chain.  “Businesses are all in the same boat,” Huang Shaoqing, associate professor of applied economics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, told Sixth Tone. “If production is not resumed as soon as possible, it is likely that, on the macroeconomic level, the external shock could bring about a considerable decrease in this year’s total output.” Warning signs of the long-term risks are already beginning to show. In early February, Hyundai closed all of its car plants in South Korea due to a shortage of parts from its China-based suppliers. The automaker has only recently begun reopening them, relying heavily on shipments from Southeast Asia. “It (the disruption) could be unfavorable to China’s businesses,” said Hu Xiaohui, associate professor of economic geography at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics. “Major international firms could go to other places like Southeast Asia to support their supply chains, leaving small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms already at the lower end of the global value chain with little chance of survival.” “In order to prevent an isolated phenomenon (some suppliers leaving the country) from becoming a megatrend and a very common phenomenon, the Chinese government at all levels must actively help (businesses resume work),” said Huang.  Such concerns have compelled the authorities to take action in helping domestic companies stay afloat. Restrictions on transportation have been eased in several cities and waived entirely in the eastern Jiangxi province, where returnees from areas less severely affected by the virus are no longer subject to compulsory quarantine. Less-developed provinces like Guizhou, meanwhile, are arranging chartered vehicles to help people return to the cities in which they live and work. And in the coastal city of Fuzhou, returnees are being tested for COVID-19 to dispel concerns of local infection. Chinese state media also reported that mobile payment giant Alipay has developed a color-coded health monitoring system to ensure that returnees to urban areas resume work safely: Green means “healthy,” yellow means “low risk” (up to one week of quarantine), and red means “high risk” (two weeks’ quarantine). The service is being used throughout Zhejiang after a trial in its provincial capital of Hangzhou, and could soon be expanded nationwide. Huang, the economics professor, believes such moves could be useful in managing the ongoing back-to-work period. “The battle against the coronavirus has been turned into one of political correctness,” Huang said, referring to some governments’ extreme containment measures. “Now that we know small- and medium-sized companies are under tremendous pressures (to survive), officials in these places should take note.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005206
Film Crew Documents Life in Wuhan Amid COVID-19 Epidemic,"The film they had planned to shoot in Hubei was derailed by the coronavirus, so instead they’re creating a visual chronicle of a city under lockdown.",2020-02-17,"The streets are eerily empty. Buildings stand silent. There’s hardly any sign of life. Such descriptions may evoke a post-apocalyptic cityscape, but they’re actually real scenes from Wuhan, a once-bustling transportation hub of 14 million people appears nearly deserted during the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. Filming the city at the center of the COVID-19 epidemic is a crew that found themselves stranded in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei province, when the city was placed under lockdown on Jan. 23 to contain the virus.  “They (my fellow crew members) are in Wuhan … They want to do something meaningful,” said Lan Bo, who went to Wuhan to direct a feature film but has shifted his focus to document daily life. “They want to record what happened.” Lan told Sixth Tone that he and his team had to postpone their scheduled film project because of the epidemic. That’s when videographer Xie Dan started filming on his phone: The team put together a short film titled “Wuhan: The Long Night” and shared it online. The haunting images of Wuhan attracted millions of views on microblogging platform Weibo, and the video’s popularity spurred Lan to expand it into a feature-length documentary. “First, since the lockdown, there hasn’t been a video presenting such a panoramic view,” Lan said. “And second, I feel that these are going to be valuable images for historical reference and for other documentaries.”  For his film, Lan and his team will focus on telling stories about how common people — health care workers, volunteers, and those in other industries — have been impacted by the shock of the epidemic. “I hope people can tell the truth, that they can face the camera honestly,” he said. “I hope my camera will not lie.” COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 people in China and infected over 70,000 worldwide. Last week, authorities revealed that the novel coronavirus had infected 1,716 medical workers, killing six of them. Over 1,102 medical workers were infected in Wuhan alone. Amid the coronavirus epidemic, many journalists and citizen-journalists have been livestreaming the situation from ground zero — the daily life, the cabin fever, and the congested hospitals. Meanwhile, others from outside Wuhan including the singer Li Yuchun and the renowned pianist Lang Lang helped create a music video as a show of solidarity with the city’s residents.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005196
Storm in a Teacup: TCM Remedy Claimed to Cure COVID-19 Sparks Furor,State media reports triggered a rush to buy the traditional medicine Shuanghuanglian. Then came the pushback.,2020-02-15,"Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, which has killed more than 1,300 people in China as of Feb. 14, rumors about possible cures for the disease have run rampant online. So when two prestigious Chinese medical institutes reported that the traditional remedy Shuanghuanglian could “inhibit” the coronavirus, it triggered a buying frenzy. The product sold out on e-commerce platforms within minutes, and even versions of the medicine designed for use on animals became scarce. But it wasn’t long before experts and netizens started questioning the report’s claims. The next day, the institutes and state media outlets that had touted the remedy’s effectiveness issued clarifications, making it clear that Shuanghuanglian couldn’t cure COVID-19.

Couples Go Long-Distance for Valentine’s Amid Coronavirus Scare,People are showering their loved ones with virtual proposals and online gifts at a time when physical contact is discouraged.,2020-02-14,"This Valentine’s Day, love is in the air — and so is a highly contagious virus.  But that hasn’t deterred couples in China from rekindling romances on the holiday for celebrating love. Amid the COVID-19 epidemic, and the accompanying lockdowns and quarantines to contain the virus, couples have found creative ways to profess their love to their partners. Zhang Xin and her boyfriend are among the couples who have been separated by the virus. Zhang, a nurse in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, has traveled to the outbreak’s epicenter of Wuhan to volunteer at one of the converted “shelter hospitals” housing patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19. Her boyfriend, Li, likes to remind her that they will make it through this trying time. Li told Sixth Tone he wanted to be with Zhang — if not in person, then at least in spirit. So he recorded a video. “My little dumpling, it has been 10 days since you went to Wuhan,” he says in the video. “I can’t celebrate Valentine’s Day with you this year. Please take care of yourself. Pipi (the dog) and I are waiting for you to return home.” “When you’re back, we will do all the things that couples do,” Li says suggestively, before quickly adding: “like getting a marriage license.” Zhang received the video the evening before Valentine’s Day, while she was on night shift. According to her friend Ma, Zhang was “very touched” by Li’s message. “You guys made me so emotional,” Ma recalled Zhang saying. “My night shift has already lasted 12 hours, but now I don’t feel sleepy anymore … Though the proposal part is super cheesy, let’s talk about marriage when I’m back.” For Xie Chen in Fuxin, a city in the northeastern Liaoning province, an effective lockdown in place since Feb. 3 has made it difficult to meet her boyfriend. The college student said she walked across a frozen river for a secret rendezvous, impervious to the risk of being caught by the guards keeping watch over the city. However, the couple decided not to meet on Valentine’s Day, instead sending their love by way of delivery. “He gave me chocolate and I gave him a calendar, both through delivery services,” Xie told Sixth Tone. “I don’t think it (the lockdown) will influence our relationship too much. Being alive is the most important thing, after all.” On microblogging platform Weibo, thousands of couples have shared their stories of love and separation during the time of COVID-19. A hashtag translating to “This Valentine’s Day, every relationship is a long-distance relationship” had been viewed over 220 million times by Friday evening. “We live so close, but we’ve never felt so far away,” one lovelorn user wrote on Weibo. Many users on the site have also shared alternative gift ideas for Valentine’s Day. Some replaced real flowers with virtual ones, while others shared photos of bouquets filled with masks, medicines, and other health- and hygiene-related products. Eva Zhang, who had planned to celebrate her two-year anniversary with her boyfriend at Tokyo Disneyland, said fears of COVID-19 had dampened the mood. When her partner arrived in Japan from Shanghai, the couple instead lined up outside pharmacies to make sure they could buy enough face masks, a product in short supply across much of the country. The couple was so busy fretting over the virus that their anniversary date slipped under their radars. “This virus thing takes up too much space in my head,” Zhang said. “But I bought (my boyfriend) a massage pillow and had it delivered to him for Valentine’s Day.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005195
"To Cope With Anxiety, Coronavirus Patients Do the Safety Dance",Medical staff at Wuhan’s “shelter hospitals” are coming up with creative ways to buoy the spirits of their bored and homesick patients.,2020-02-14,"Videos of masked coronavirus patients square dancing with their doctors in full hazmat suits were widely circulated on Chinese social media this week, shedding light on how patients and medical workers are finding psychological solace amid the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. As of Friday, COVID-19 had killed over 1,300 people in China — most of them in the central Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak originated — and infected over 60,000 worldwide. Given the shortage of mental health professionals, other medical workers have had to think creatively to cope with the sometimes-grim reality. At several of Wuhan’s fangcang — exhibition centers, stadiums, and other public venues that have been converted into temporary “shelter hospitals” — patients have embraced square dancing and tai chi to stay healthy in mind and body. “The patients feel heavy-hearted being quarantined at the hospital, so our staff have arranged for them to dance for half an hour after dinner,” said Zhou Junhui, head nurse at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. “Square dancing cheers them up and improves their immunity, which in turn helps them recover.”  Because of a dire shortage of beds at Wuhan’s overstreched hospitals, over 4,300 patients with relatively mild symptoms have been sent to the city’s seven fangcang. Mental health professionals regularly visit these facilities to offer counseling services, and have set up chat groups, online forums, and hotlines for use by both patients and medical workers who need to unburden themselves. But there are still too few of these sorely needed specialists to go around, according to Xiao Jinsong, a senior counselor at Zhongnan Hospital. “Psychological services are necessary to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder,” Zhao Xudong, a professor of psychiatry at Tongji University in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “Some people cannot bear the lingering impact of their trauma.” So-called primitive fears — fear of strange surroundings, closed spaces, the unknown, or death, for example — can consume people’s emotions, said Zhang Chun, director of the Nanjing Psychological Crisis Intervention Center. As a result, Zhang added, they may experience anxiety, general dissatisfaction, or even aggressive behavior. To help mitigate such negative emotions, Wuhan’s fangcang have established radio stations, book clubs, and counseling groups for their patients. Xu Feng, a pseudonym for a patient at one of the shelter hospitals, described how the coronavirus has torn families apart. Some of those who are admitted may have lost a parent or a spouse to the epidemic, he said — but for the sake of their relatives who are still alive, they must remain strong. “To society, we may be just a small part,” he said. “To our families, we may be everything.” Contributions: Zhao Siwei and Zhu Wenbo.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005199
"How Wenzhou, 900 km From Wuhan, Went Into Total Lockdown","Despite being halfway across China from the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, the coastal city has been hit hard by the virus.",2020-02-14,"Lüzhang Village usually comes to life around the Lunar New Year holiday, with neighbors setting off firecrackers and gathering for mahjong games and boozy feasts. But for the past three weeks, Lüzhang’s 100 or so families have kept their doors firmly shut. Only the occasional rooster crow breaks the silence. The village, which sits on the edge of the eastern city of Wenzhou, is under a full lockdown as authorities take drastic measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus that has killed over 1,300 people in China as of Feb. 14. Residents are only allowed to leave their homes once every two days to buy groceries — and must present a specially issued pass to do so. The atmosphere among locals is tense, and their anxieties are focused on one house in particular: a four-story structure with a shiny SUV parked outside. The car’s license plate indicates it was registered in Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus emerged in December. The SUV’s owner is Xia Xiaochai, a 38-year-old Lüzhang native who has spent the past decade running a business in central China. His annual trips back to his hometown are normally filled with joyful reunions, but since Jan. 23, he and his family haven’t left the house once. “I know they (the villagers) are all afraid of me,” Xia tells Sixth Tone.  Xia is part of an enormous tribe of traveling Wenzhou entrepreneurs who have unwittingly brought their hometown to a standstill, with the coastal city facing one of the most serious COVID-19 outbreaks outside Hubei province — the center of the epidemic. Wenzhou is famous across China for its savvy businesspeople, who have moved across the world in vast numbers in search of new moneymaking opportunities. There are an estimated 1.6 million people from Wenzhou running businesses in other parts of China, and another 600,000 overseas. And one of the largest magnets for the city’s diaspora has been Wuhan. Migrants from Wenzhou set up a chamber of commerce in Wuhan in 1997, and within a decade there were an estimated 170,000 Wenzhou businesspeople working in the city. Xia made the move in 2009, setting up a beauty parlor in downtown Wuhan. “The street is full of beauty salons that are all run by Wenzhou businesspeople,” says Xia. “We also dominate the local shoe, garment, infrastructure construction, and hardware industries.” The thriving community, however, became a liability for their hometown after COVID-19 began to spread rapidly through Wuhan. As the situation deteriorated through January, thousands returned to Wenzhou to celebrate the Lunar New Year — or simply to escape the epidemic. The virus came with them. By Jan. 29, there were 172 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wenzhou, the highest figure for any city outside Hubei province. Of the 58 people diagnosed with the disease that day, 60% were people who had recently returned from Wuhan. “We’ve found that the incidence of virus infections has risen in direct proportion to the number of returning Wenzhou people,” Tang Xiaoshu, Wenzhou’s deputy mayor, told reporters at a Jan. 29 press conference. The risks weren’t difficult to foresee given the size of Wenzhou’s diaspora. Wenzhou authorities started taking action to contain the risks of an outbreak Jan. 20 — the day Zhong Nanshan, the virus expert famous for his work during the 2003 SARS epidemic, revealed that COVID-19 was capable of human-to-human transmission. Four days before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, officials contacted the Wenzhou chamber of commerce in Wuhan, telling them to stop Wenzhou businesspeople from returning to their hometown. “We did issue a notice on Jan. 20, encouraging Wenzhou people not to return home for the upcoming holiday,” Yang Buqing, secretary-general of the Wenzhou chamber of commerce in Hubei province, tells Sixth Tone. The message, however, appeared to have almost no impact. By Jan. 29, 33,000 people had returned to Wenzhou from Wuhan and its neighboring cities. The flood of returnees continued even after Wuhan imposed a lockdown Jan. 23, cutting off almost all air, road, and rail transportation, with 3,600 people arriving from Wuhan each day on average. According to Yang, most — if not all — the Wenzhou people she knows have left Wuhan. Xia got out the same day the chamber of commerce issued its notice. He, his wife, two children, and over a dozen relatives drove the 900 kilometers back to Lüzhang in a convoy of four cars. At that point, Wuhan didn’t feel like a city in the grip of a public health crisis, according to Xia. He was mainly concerned with getting home ahead of the holiday. “The atmosphere in Wuhan was just like usual — nobody was wearing a mask,” says Xia, who is also deputy chairman of the Wenzhou chamber of commerce in Wuhan. “My thoughts back then were that my elderly mother was waiting for me at home, and I hadn’t seen her for a whole year. I had to go.” After arriving home, Xia’s family started their traditional Lunar New Year routine: hosting big family gatherings. They ate and had fun together for two days. The next day, however, Xia heard about the lockdown in Wuhan. He realized that the issue might be more serious than he’d imagined. The same day, his brother-in-law — who had also just returned from Wuhan — tested positive for COVID-19 after going to the hospital, saying he felt unwell. “I was paying attention to the issue and wasn’t really worried (until then),” says Xia. “But I really freaked out after my brother-in-law was diagnosed. I started to receive numerous calls from disease control staff from the village, township, county, and city-level departments.” Lüzhang immediately banned all cars with Wuhan license plates from entering the village, and refused entry to almost all outsiders — a practice enforced in many rural areas across China. Xia and around 20 family members, who had attended a dinner with the confirmed patient, were ordered to stay indoors for a two-week observation period — later extended to three weeks. Village officials came to disinfect Xia’s car and his entire house. They told Xia to call an emergency number if any family members felt any form of discomfort. The local party secretary has been delivering food to Xia’s home each day, to ensure the family doesn’t go outside under any circumstances. New cases of COVID-19, however, continued to emerge across Wenzhou. On Feb. 2, the city took the tough step of confining all of its 8 million residents to their homes, with just one person from each household allowed to go outside once every two days to buy food. Wenzhou was the second city nationwide — after Huanggang, which borders Wuhan — to implement this extreme policy.  Two days later, Wenzhou cut off all transportation connections with the outside world. Authorities began offering a 1,000-yuan ($140) reward for any tipoffs regarding the whereabouts of returnees from Hubei. As other Chinese cities gradually return to work, Wenzhou still appears almost deserted. Cheng Lu, who lives in the city center, tells Sixth Tone she barely recognizes her hometown. A few days ago, on her way to the supermarket, the 29-year-old passed Gongyuan Road — home to many of Wenzhou’s most popular tourist attractions, including a Confucius temple. “Big crowds used to pack this street during festivals, but now the place is empty, though red lanterns still hang from the lampposts on both sides of the street,” says Cheng. “There was a banner at the entrance of the street, saying, ‘discover early, report early, quarantine early, treat early: Be responsible for yourself and others!’” According to Cheng, there were no vehicles on the streets except for police cars and ambulances, and almost all the stores are closed, though many still have their LED advertising panels switched on. Wenzhou’s businesses have to file an application to the local authorities to reopen. So far, however, the city is mostly granting permission only to companies manufacturing much-needed supplies, such as face masks and hazmat-style protective uniforms, local officials have said. Some residential communities, meanwhile, have tightened restrictions even more. Community officials have started purchasing groceries on behalf of residents, so that they don’t have to go outside at all. Photos have emerged showing hundreds of identical rations of fresh food laid out on housing complex courtyards. On the whole, local residents are supportive of the restrictions, Cheng says. When she posted a photo of the empty streets to WeChat, many of her friends expressed sadness, but also left comments such as, “by staying at home, we can save the disease-control workers from extra worries,” or, “everything will be OK if we follow the guidelines now.” Xia, the Wuhan returnee, agrees with this sentiment. “Wenzhou people are known for their business skills, but one key factor to our success is our unity,” he says. “We’re always united in the face of difficulties. The fight against the coronavirus won’t be an exception.” On Thursday, Xia and his family finally completed the extended observation period. Luckily, no more family members have developed any abnormal symptoms. Throughout the quarantine, a bright red sign hung on Xia’s front door, announcing the date until which the family was required to stay inside. Lüzhang officials, however, refrained from sealing the house with tape or metal bars, as has reportedly happened elsewhere in the region. “Self-discipline is very important in this period,” says Xia. “If I were them (the other villagers), I’d be terrified as well. I experienced the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, as I was doing business in (the southwestern province) Sichuan back then. But honestly, the fear brought about by that major earthquake was nothing compared with how this epidemic has struck me.” After a rapid increase in infections early February, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Wenzhou has slowed. There have been a total of 496 confirmed patients in the city as of Feb. 13, of which 140 have fully recovered. No deaths have been reported so far. Xia’s brother-in-law is still receiving treatment at a hospital in central Wenzhou. “He kept coughing, but he feels lucky compared with those who are sick in Wuhan,” says Xia. “In Wenzhou, one patient is taken care of by a team of medical workers. The entire hospital pays great attention to his condition. We all see what’s happening to patients in Wuhan.”  For this reason, Xia says he understands why many people evaded the lockdown in Wuhan and returned to Wenzhou, even though they ran the risk of bringing the epidemic with them. “I’m totally with them!” says Xia. “Just imagine if I’d stayed there and contracted the virus — what could I do? The waiting times to get treated are too long, and it’s making people desperate.” Xia has no idea when he’ll be able to return to Wuhan. “But we’ll definitely go back: Our entire business and lives are there,” he says. His two children both attend school in the city. The epidemic, however, has actually renewed Xia’s love for Wenzhou. He may start investing more in the city in the future, he says. “I take pride in my hometown,” says Xia. “Even during such a big crisis, the impression I’ve had is that everything has been orderly, and people are complying with the government’s policies.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005197
Fear and Loving in Shanghai,"There may be more than love in the air this Valentine’s Day, but how much longer can we let our fear control us?",2020-02-14,"Walking into a restaurant in downtown Shanghai on Monday, I was greeted with a gun to the head. It wasn’t as much of a shock as you might expect. In a routine likely familiar to anyone who has spent time in China over the past few weeks, the waiter holding it was just checking my temperature. After ascertaining I was a healthy 36.4 degrees Celsius, he gracefully ushered me in. Scanning the nearly empty restaurant with a practiced eye, I picked out a seat that would put at least 5 meters between me and the only other two occupied tables in the room. I kept my mask on until my food arrived, then started shoveling my meal into my mouth as quickly as possible, only pausing when a peal of laughter from one of the other tables shook me out of my daze. I swiveled and stared, thinking to myself: “Why are you talking with your masks off? What if your spittle lands on someone?” The thought was barely formed when I recoiled at what I’d become. Almost everyone’s nerves have been on edge since late January, when the country’s health authorities belatedly admitted the risk from COVID-19 was far higher than they had originally indicated. Since then, over 1,000 people have died, and more than 60,000 have fallen ill. But the vast majority of the damage has been concentrated in the central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan, which lies over 800 kilometers from Shanghai. In this city of over 20 million, barely 300 people have gotten sick so far. And yet there I was, treating innocuous lunch-table conversation like a deadly public health hazard. Mutual suspicion and fear are some of the defining characteristics of epidemics. If you heard that someone’s life was devastated by an earthquake or hurricane, you’d likely sincerely and unblinkingly sympathize with them. But when the damage is caused by an infectious disease, it’s all too easy for our basic human compassion to be overpowered by our even baser impulse to protect ourselves. Suddenly it’s not so hard to imagine the affected community not as sympathetic victims, but as a dangerous threat. The ongoing epidemic has already sparked a wave of Sinophobia and xenophobia abroad. China, with its massive, highly concentrated population and often wobbly public health system, has for years been stereotyped as a threat to global health, but rarely more so than when The Wall Street Journal is publishing pieces with titles like “China is the Real Sick Man of Asia.” These same xenophobic reactions are mirrored within China itself. In recent days, despite a high-profile media campaign to remind citizens that “our enemy is the virus, not Wuhanese,” anyone linked to Wuhan or Hubei province has become a target of fear and discrimination. To cite just one example, on Jan. 27, a group of Shanghainese refused to board their flight back from Japan after learning they’d be sharing the plane with 16 Wuhanese passengers. Wuhanese aren’t the only victims. Their city is one of the country’s central transit hubs, meaning essentially anyone who has traveled in the past few weeks is suspect — a group that includes hundreds of millions of Chinese who went home or on vacation for the Lunar New Year holiday. The resulting panic is only legitimized by local governments’ so-called hardcore epidemic prevention methods — which coincidentally primarily target migrants and other marginalized groups while largely exempting well-off homeowners and local residents from scrutiny. “I don’t understand why those people are so eager to get back,” one of my local friends ranted to me recently. “We Shanghainese obediently locked ourselves at home for two whole weeks, and now those outsiders are coming and ruining everything!” “They need to work,” I replied. “They need to survive! They’re not like you, with a nice job that will pay them to work from home.” Our chat ended awkwardly. Fear is as infectious as any disease, and the current outbreak is only fueling tensions between China’s entrenched and increasingly wealthy bourgeoisie and the migrant workforce that powers its cities. I belong to the former category. Really, I’m not any different from my friend. If I was, I wouldn’t have been so uneasy at overhearing a nice conversation in a restaurant. I’ve spent the past few weeks seemingly in a constant state of fear: I’m scared on the street; scared in the elevator; scared any time anyone gets too close. In my increasingly neurotic imagination, every passerby is just a giant virus masquerading as a person. And frankly, I’m tired of it. There’s a line from “The Hot Zone,” a 2019 American miniseries, that has stuck with me. “The Ebola virus spreads when we show each other love, kindness, affection. When we’re most human,” the series’ main character says at one point. The only way to fully protect yourself from infection, the logic goes, is to be coldblooded, absolutely rational, and willing to cut yourself off from all others.  That’s not much of a life though, is it? The threat of COVID-19 is as psychological as it is pathological. I’ll wear my mask, wash my hands 100 times a day, stay cooped up at home, avoid public places, and shun physical contact, but only because I want life to return to normal as soon as possible. This week, netizens on microblogging site Weibo have been joking that “this Valentine’s Day, every relationship is a long-distance relationship.” Stuck in quarantine — and with most restaurants shuttered anyway — romance for many couples means a candlelit video call. It’s not the end of the world, but no one wants it to last forever. That’s because a life without companionship is not worth living. Even in the face of a crisis, we should never sacrifice our affection and sense of humanity. Next Valentine’s Day, I want to enjoy a nice meal with my husband without worrying about who we bumped into that day, where we’ve been — or whether the couple at the next table is laughing just a bit too loudly.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005198
"As Epidemic Rages On, China’s Workers Embrace a New Normal","Working from home has become a daily reality for millions of people in China, though some are finding it more convenient than others.",2020-02-14,"Amid the ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic that has brought large swaths of China to a standstill, millions of people in the country have been forced to take their work home. “I think it’s pretty good,” said Wang Jie, a Shanghai-based public relations executive who has been working from home since Monday. “It saves me the commute time and it’s more freeing, giving me flexibility to arrange my work,” the 26-year-old told Sixth Tone. Prior to Monday, when domestic businesses were officially expected to resume normal operations after the Spring Festival holiday was extended by 10 days to contain the contagion, less than half of companies surveyed said they expected to reopen, according to domestic media, and many were opting to have their employees work from home. Meanwhile, Wang has been enjoying sleeping in until 11 a.m. on less-busy mornings and not having to worry about scrambling to clock in. With all the time saved, Wang can carefully disinfect her family’s home — a daily ritual she considers a “must” during the epidemic. Not everyone is welcoming the new working style with open arms, however. Common complaints include having to work in communal family space for want of a desk setup, or being expected to do even more work than would be required under normal office hours. David Tsai, a 27-year-old marketer in the online professional training sector, returned to Beijing from his family’s home in the southwestern Sichuan province at the end of January to address some of the sudden changes the coronavirus epidemic has foisted on his company’s projects. But collaborating as a team is more challenging without a shared office, he says. “Some people are just touching fish,” Tsai told Sixth Tone, using an online slang term referring to lazy employees. Moreover, Tsai said, some of his colleagues have yet to return from their hometowns due to local quarantine measures and are unable to access the company’s internal network.  “This has made our work very inefficient,” said Tsai, whose company employs around 6,000 people. “Even though our solutions have been worked out (in theory), the colleagues implementing those measures may still be performing poorly.” Tsai isn’t the only one with concerns about China’s unprecedented work-from-home experiment. Dingding, a 24-year-old woman from the eastern Anhui province who works for a new media-focused internet company, told Sixth Tone that she feels like she is being micromanaged by her boss, who demands that his employees be on call at all times. According to a “code of conduct” Dingding’s supervisor sent out, employees must give two progress reports per day, as well as wash their hair and change out of their pajamas before daily conference calls, purportedly to “keep morale high.” But Dingding, who is at home with her family, isn’t comfortable being so closely bound to her work. “You don’t really have the same sense of urgency, and it’s hard to keep up the same tempo as when you’re at the office,” she said. The loss of any semblance of work-life balance also troubles Dingding. “Your work and your home are together: You have no time off at all, and you don’t know when you’ll finish,” she said. “And on top of all that, he (the boss) is watching you more closely.” In Tsai’s case, this is true in the literal sense. His company is requiring all staff to turn on their computers’ front-facing cameras while working so that supervisors can tune in at any time, without warning, and verify that everyone is pulling their weight.  In late January, China’s top health authority said that all nonessential employees, as well as those from epidemic-stricken areas, should be allowed to postpone any Spring Festival travel from their ancestral homes to the cities they live and work in, or work from home to avoid the risk of infection. Companies have taken different measures to work around the belief that the coronavirus is more easily spread in crowded spaces. Some employers have arranged staggered office hours for their staff, while others have imposed their own longer extensions to the Lunar New Year break, or asked employees to self-quarantine and work from home for two weeks upon returning from their holiday travels. As a result of these policies, WeChat Work, a conference call platform owned by tech giant Tencent, has seen the stress on its servers increase tenfold. “During the epidemic, we’re seeing heightened demand from all kinds of industries,” WeChat Work said in a statement to Sixth Tone, adding that livestreamed education is receiving the biggest boost.  But in these unprecedented times, people are questioning the feasibility of coping with increased pressure as a worsening economic downturn threatens to drag down businesses without rainy-day funds to sustain themselves. While some provincial and local governments including Beijing have vowed to subsidize smaller businesses to help keep them afloat, how quickly these funds can be disbursed, as well as how much they can actually help, are difficult to predict. Tsai the marketer says his firm — which plans to go public in the near future — is now asking for greater productivity from its employees in order to meet performance targets and appease investors, even as the epidemic poses ever greater challenges. “It’s hard to do marketing now,” said Tsai, adding that he will consider quitting if the pressure becomes too great, even with the current gloomy job market. “If the epidemic situation cannot be alleviated and I have to keep working from home, I’ll feel even more conflicted.” For 24-year-old Dingding, whose company is much smaller at around 200 staff, her boss’s nagging calls for mobilization are an indication of the pressure the company is under to survive. “He (the boss) says we have to be prepared for a hard time,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005189
Hubei Reports Spike in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases,"After changing its reporting standards, the province set a single-day record on Thursday with almost 15,000 new cases of COVID-19.",2020-02-13,"Health officials in the central province of Hubei reported 14,840 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, the largest single-day increase recorded so far and an almost tenfold jump from Wednesday. The sudden surge — which officials and experts largely attribute to a shift in diagnostic criteria rather than a spike in newly symptomatic patients — has shaken hopes that the epidemic might be nearing its peak. It has also underscored how inaccurate testing kits and slow-moving confirmation protocols continue to hamper efforts to understand the true scale and spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic. In an announcement early Thursday morning, Hubei’s provincial health commission stated that it would begin adding patients that had been clinically diagnosed — that is, diagnosed by a physician but without having had their illnesses confirmed via a nucleic acid test — to its daily tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The move came eight days after the National Health Commission released guidelines permitting doctors in Hubei, but not elsewhere in China, to make clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 “when radiographic imaging of potential cases reveals features of pneumonia.” The commission’s guidelines also directed Hubei’s health authorities to treat clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed when releasing data to the public. It is unclear why the province waited a week before applying the new standards. Generally speaking, a positive nucleic acid or genetic sequencing test result is required before health authorities will confirm the existence of a novel coronavirus infection. But the situation in Hubei has been complicated by a chronic shortage of test kits and a high rate of false negatives. Wang Chen, an expert in respiratory diseases at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told the country’s state broadcaster last week that nucleic acid tests given to those who “definitely” had the disease only came back positive 30% to 50% of the time. Doctors on the ground have been calling for greater flexibility for weeks. On Feb. 3, the Hubei provincial authorities received a request that physicians be allowed to bypass the lengthy and unreliable nucleic acid testing process and diagnose cases on the basis of lung scans. Experts, however, caution that diagnoses made on the basis of lung scans may not be reliable outside of the outbreak’s epicenter. Lu Hongzhou, a virologist at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital, told Sixth Tone that the relaxed diagnostic guidelines should only be applied in places where there is a high concentration of known infections. “It’s the flu season, so many people with clinical symptoms similar to COVID-19 may just have the flu,” Lu said. “The likelihood of a patient in Hubei having COVID-19 instead of the flu is greater than in other places.” Excluding Hubei, China’s health authorities reported 312 new cases of COVID-19 nationwide Thursday, down from 377 the previous day. The vast majority of clinically diagnosed cases were reported in Hubei’s provincial capital of Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated last December. The city recorded more than 13,000 new cases Thursday, bringing its confirmed total to over 30,000. There are signs the city may be hard-pressed to keep up if that number continues to rise. According to calculations from Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper, Wuhan has just 37,000 hospital beds. That number includes not only formal medical institutions, but also newly built temporary treatment facilities like Huoshenshan Hospital and makeshift clinics being set up in university dorms and recreational centers across the city.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005192
Coronavirus’ Assault on Wuhan Mental Hospital Alarms Experts,"Despite the compounded challenge of having to treat patients for COVID-19 as well as mental illness, Wuhan’s psychiatric facilities have largely been left to fend for themselves.",2020-02-13,"Experts are for calling for more stringent measures to protect people with psychological conditions after at least 80 patients and staff at a mental health facility in Wuhan contracted the coronavirus that has now killed more than 1,300 people in China and infected over 60,000 worldwide. Domestic magazine China Newsweek reported last weekend that over 80 patients and medical workers at Wuhan Mental Health Center had been diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia, or COVID-19. An employee of the center who declined to use her name because she was not permitted to speak with media told Sixth Tone on Wednesday that the hospital had stopped admitting new patients “for fear of cross-contamination.” “We have suspected patients, confirmed patients, and severely ill patients,” the staff member said. “All of our (spare) rooms are being used to accommodate infected patients, and we have a shortage of protective gear.” Wuhan Mental Health Center, also known as Wuhan Psychiatric Hospital, is the largest mental hospital in the central Hubei province. Isolation wards comprise much of the hospital’s facilities, posing a high risk of cross-contamination among patients and medical professionals alike. A former patient who was hospitalized at the facility last year told Sixth Tone that the conditions in her ward were poor. She described how the primary and secondary care areas were kept segregated by a sturdy metal door: In the primary care area, most of the rooms had three beds, she said, while in the larger secondary care area, five or six people might share the same living space. “One side of each bed was attached to the wall — otherwise they wouldn’t all fit,” she said, adding that most rooms did not have their own toilet.  A doctor at the facility told China Newsweek that some 10 inpatients developed fevers beginning around Jan. 12. The hospital’s infection control personnel assumed the fevers were the result of a common cold. “At first, we didn’t know that the (coronavirus) disease could be transmitted from one person to another,” an employee from the hospital’s publicity office told online media outlet Pear Video. “We didn’t have sufficient awareness of the disease.”  The first symptoms were observed the day after Wuhan’s health commission claimed on Jan. 11 that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, and that no new cases had been detected since Jan. 3. The city’s health authorities also denied that medical workers were contracting the virus from their patients — though an investigation by domestic media outlet Caixin later found otherwise. In a Jan. 27 interview with state broadcaster China Central Television, Wuhan’s mayor admitted that his government had been slow to relay information to the public in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak because, according to the country’s epidemic prevention law, he had needed to “get approval” before making any public disclosures. Meanwhile, among the first group of 10 or so patients, high fevers gave way to respiratory failure. According to China Newsweek’s report from Saturday, at lease 50 patients have tested positive for the coronavirus since Jan. 20, along with another 30 medical staff, including the hospital’s deputy director. “Severe psychiatric patients do not have a firm grasp on reality and lack the ability to control their environment,” Zhao Xudong, a professor of psychiatry at Shanghai’s Tongji University, told Sixth Tone. “They don’t realize when danger is coming and don’t respond well to the threat of disaster. They might appear indifferent, without understanding what’s happening. This group of people requires greater care from others.” However, a shortage of protective equipment has hampered efforts to provide this care while increasing medical workers’ risk of exposure to the virus. On Jan. 24 and Feb. 3, Wuhan Mental Health Center appealed to the public for donated medical supplies. “Our hospital urgently needs protective suits,” read a graphic the hospital posted online.  “Now two of our wards have cases of infection,” a medical worker from the hospital posted on Chinese social media in late January, around the time several staff were trying to spread the word of their dire situation. “Due to the shortage of beds in designated hospitals (for treating COVID-19), we’ve had to clear out a ward to quarantine and save our own staff.” The employee declined Sixth Tone’s interview request because it was “not allowed” by the hospital. In coronavirus-stricken parts of Hubei, hospitals face severe shortage of drugs, face masks, and protective suits. According to Zhao, mental hospitals are not a top priority when it comes to distributing emergency supplies. “The prevention and control of infectious diseases is routine work at mental hospitals, but it’s rarely done to the same standard as at other hospitals. The dearth of medical supplies is insufficient,” Zhao said. “Some hospital buildings are old. According to strict disinfection and quarantine rules, certain wards have to be isolated, with the connecting channels strictly separated, which is hard to achieve at some hospitals. So it may be easy to have a large area of infection.”  Another case of hospital-acquired infections among psychiatric patients has reportedly occurred at Wuhan Youfu Hospital, located within walking distance of the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the first infections were traced. Some of these patients went to Youfu Hospital for health checks. As of Tuesday, 86 patients — including many with mental disorders and many who were turned away by other hospitals — were under quarantine at Youfu, according to a Shanghai-based health news outlet. Wuhan Mental Health Center declined multiple interview requests, telling Sixth Tone it would provide updated information in an official statement via its public account on social app WeChat. That statement had not been issued by time of publication Thursday. Elsewhere in the city, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, a designated facility for treating infectious diseases, has allocated 30 beds for psychiatric patients with COVID-19. This is far from sufficient, Zhao says, because such patients require treatment for both the disease and their disorder. Because of the lack of beds in designated coronavirus hospitals, psychiatric care facilities like Wuhan Mental Health Center are largely left to fend for themselves when it comes to treating coronavirus patients. But their facilities don’t meet industry standards for intensive care and lack life support machines, a doctor told China Newsweek. A Jan. 31 report by the Wuhan government-controlled newspaper Changjiang Daily co-authored by an employee from the hospital’s propaganda department praised the medical staff for working overtime to treat “undiagnosed fever patients” and handling a larger load of CT scans. Medical staff at mental hospitals “should be well-protected just like at any other hospital,” Zhao said. “If they fall ill, there will be no one left to take care of the patients.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005191
Hygiene Product Donation Drive Puts Frontline Females First,"While campaigns collecting sanitary pads for workers on the front line of the COVID-19 epidemic are making progress, institutions reluctant to receive them show women’s needs are still being overlooked.",2020-02-13,"As millions of people are finding different ways to help the frontline medical workers battling COVID-19, a new campaign is solely focused on delivering something that’s been largely missing: feminine hygiene products.  The campaign, Coronavirus Sister Support, collected over 2 million yuan ($280,000) in under 24 hours after launching Tuesday, according to its founder Jiang Jinjing. The money will be used to provide period panties and sanitary pads for female frontline doctors and nurses in Hubei province, the center of the COVID-19 outbreak that has so far killed over 1,300 people in China and infected more than 60,000 globally. “I was watching a video of a female doctor instructing people to wear protective clothing,” Jiang told Sixth Tone, recounting how the campaign materialized. “She said people needed an hour to put it on or take it off. I wondered: If it takes so long to get out of the protective clothing, what if they have their period? How can they go to the bathroom and change pads?” Jiang said she immediately thought of donating period panties — special underwear designed to absorb menstrual blood without the need to wear a tampon or sanitary pad — to frontline medical workers. The 24-year-old then shared her thoughts on microblogging platform Weibo, where she now has over 270,000 followers. In a matter of hours, messages from strangers started pouring in: “Can I help, too?” With so many people reaching out to her, Jiang said she put together a volunteer team of 45 members to streamline the process. The team then contacted hospitals and factories producing sanitary products, as well as courier services that were still delivering to cities in the province, which has been under lockdown from as early as Jan. 23 to contain the epidemic.  “Over 140 hospitals in Hubei province have contacted us (through different means) saying they need sanitary products,” said Jiang. “A lot of female medical workers, especially those from rural areas, did not prepare any hygienic products because they were less informed about the current situation.” “One female medical worker from Xiaogan (a city in Hubei) told me they were quarantined at the last minute and didn’t have time to pack their belongings. The head nurse had to go out and buy pads for every female doctor and nurse.” According to Jiang, many hospitals weren’t very aware of the needs of their female staff. One of the hospitals in the provincial capital of Wuhan even refused to receive period panties when Jiang’s team proposed to deliver them.  “We need protective clothing and masks — these are not urgent,” Jiang recalled the hospital staff saying. “I was very disappointed … I know masks and protective clothes are important, but I think the needs of female medical workers also ought to be acknowledged,” she said. Other hospitals, too, have prioritized donations of protective gear, overlooking the basic needs of their female frontline workers. Sakura Chan is a co-founder of the Firefly Plan campaign, which aims to deliver a range of products to hospitals, including disinfectants, hand creams, and period panties. However, she said that in the beginning of the campaign, most hospitals weren’t interested in receiving women’s hygiene products. “They would tell me they needed disinfectant, ethyl alcohol, masks, or other supplies, but not period panties,” Chan told Sixth Tone. “Probably because they hadn’t thought of this, or the decision maker was a man so he couldn’t understand such issues.”  While many charities are focused on delivering medical equipment, there’s been little to no focus on women’s needs, Chan said. She added that those familiar with the matter inside the hospitals have told her team that they’re desperately in need of feminine hygiene products. Bai Meidaijia, a lecturer in gender and media studies, told Sixth Tone that neglecting such female needs is a classic example of gender discrimination. “Women’s menstruation should be the authorities’ concern when it comes to policymaking,” Bai said. “The media always describe women’s contributions by emphasizing their gender — like women cutting their hair to go to the front line. But when it comes time to acknowledge their physical needs, those in charge fail to do so.” While most have supported Jiang’s and Chan’s campaigns, not all were thrilled about discussing feminism during a time of crisis. “People are dying, why do you still care about what’s in your underwear?” read a comment under Jiang’s Weibo post. Jiang said such hateful reactions point to a larger societal trend of snubbing women’s contributions. “People might think that combating public crises is just a ‘man’s thing,’ while in fact there are so many female medical workers on the front line,” she said. According to the Shanghai Women’s Federation, a quasi-governmental organization, more than half of the health care workers at frontline hospitals in Hubei are women, and 90% of all nurses there are women. Many of the project leaders and workers involved in the construction of Huoshenshan Hospital — a pop-up quarantine facility built in 10 days — were also women. However, some Chinese media outlets seem to have turned a blind eye to their contributions. In a now-deleted Weibo post, local media in the southwestern Sichuan province shared a photo of six male doctors from the province’s 30-strong medical team — 21 of whom were women. In another case, Weibo’s opening interface showing solidarity with the frontline police officers and medics had exclusively male representation, angering many and prompting one user of the site to design their own female version for the campaign. According to Bai, the absence of representation is about more than fairness: It can also influence policymaking in the long run. “Some people argue that it’s not a good time for feminist critique, as we are fighting the coronavirus,” Bai said. “But in fact, what media represents — the culture, concepts, and gender awareness of those in power — not only affects recognition of women’s contributions but also leads to the policies and measures that we decide to take.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005190
"China’s Cities Slowly, Gingerly Return to Work","Businesses are starting to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, but workers are taking extreme precautions.",2020-02-13,"SHANGHAI — Zhang Luo was supposed to go back to the office Monday, but the 27-year-old was too scared of the commute and decided to take a day of annual leave. After locking herself inside her apartment for weeks to avoid catching COVID-19 — a disease that has killed over 1,300 people in China as of Feb. 13 — the thought of riding the metro to Hongqiao, one of Shanghai’s busiest business hubs, was just too much. “When I imagined the countless strangers I might run into during rush hour, I freaked out,” says Zhang, who works for an internet finance company and whose name has been changed out of privacy concerns. “I just needed an extra day to mentally prepare myself.” People across Shanghai have been having similar internal battles this week as the city of 24 million gradually grinds back to life after an extended public holiday designed to contain the outbreak. The virus has reportedly infected 315 people in the city, with one death and of 62 full recoveries, at time of publication.  Monday was the first official workday for most companies in Shanghai — as well as other cities including Beijing, Chongqing, and Shenzhen — since the Lunar New Year break began Jan. 24. Many people, however, remain reluctant to return to their workplaces, fearing the reopening of businesses may produce a wave of new infections. Around 40% of Shanghai’s residents are originally from elsewhere, and large numbers of people have been coming back to the city in recent days to restart work. More than 158,000 people per day on average arrived at Shanghai’s airports and train stations between Feb. 7 and 10, municipal officials announced Monday. Zhong Nanshan, a virus expert renowned for his work during the 2003 SARS epidemic, has identified the days following the large-scale migration as a key moment that could determine whether the outbreak will soon reach a turning point. Local authorities have been attempting to minimize anxieties, encouraging companies to stagger shifts to reduce rush-hour crowds and allow staff to work remotely. Public areas are required to be disinfected on a daily basis, while metro stations and office complexes have been ordered to ensure everyone entering wears a face mask and undergoes a temperature check.  The city is also continuing hard-line restrictions on those arriving from virus-stricken areas. Around 800 vehicles have been denied entry to Shanghai since Jan. 22, and any outsiders without a place of residence or job in the city will be “persuaded to leave,” local officials have said. Returnees from high-risk regions are subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Shanghai’s streets have become noticeably busier over recent days, though many restaurants, cafés, and small businesses remain shuttered. Several shopping malls are still closing early, while popular restaurant chains including Taier and Gelaoguan have announced their outlets will be closed until at least the end of the week. At People’s Square metro station, one of Shanghai’s busiest connections, passenger volumes are less than 20% of their normal level, a manager from the station told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper Monday. Those going back to work, meanwhile, are often finding the experience surreal, as their normal routines are disrupted by the extreme precautions enforced all over the city.  Chu Hao, who works for a Shanghai architecture firm, went back to the office Monday. He drove into work — arriving quicker than usual, because there were so few cars on the road — to find that only around 40% of his colleagues had joined him. “Everywhere smelled of disinfectant,” Chu says. “The company offered us around 10 face masks, alcohol wipes, and other protective products. For lunch, we weren’t allowed to eat in the cafeteria. Instead, the company prepared designated lunch boxes.” By the afternoon, Chu says he’d had enough: The building management had shut down the air conditioning over fears the circulated air might spread the disease, and the office was freezing. He downloaded all the documents he needed and decided to work from home for the rest of the week. Even after returning home, Chu’s battle against the virus wasn’t over. His wife — who had sent him dozens of reminders about safety precautions throughout the day — opened the door with a bottle of disinfectant in hand, and Chu took off his shoes and coat before entering the apartment. Chu then went straight for a shower, while his wife mopped the floor where he had walked past and put his work clothes in the washing machine. “We do everything we can to seek psychological comfort,” says Chu wryly. “But I know many people must have done the same thing.”  Zhang, the internet finance worker, finally faced the music Tuesday and headed to Hongqiao, though she made sure to avoid riding the metro. Instead, she cycled for 30 minutes, before catching the bus. “It was extremely cold — all the windows were open the whole time (to improve ventilation),” says Zhang. “I’m sure the sensor wasn’t able to read my temperature when I arrived at the office building.” Unlike Chu’s experience, Zhang found her office to be a frenzy of activity. The extended shutdown has cost her company dearly, and she expects her boss will have to take drastic action later in the year to balance the books. “Facing such a crisis, this year’s budget will be cut,” says Zhang. “Quite a few temps and new employees will be at risk of being laid off.”  Zhang’s colleagues are also aware of the situation. The customer service team, which is on the same floor, has been making call after call, barely taking a break, she says. “Most of them are temps, and there’s a high possibility they’ll lose their jobs,” says Zhang. “So, they’re hoping to make as much money as they can. But I feel like they should change their face masks every hour — they must be wet!” The crisis has also affected Zhang’s plans. Before the Lunar New Year, she’d been offered a new job at another company, but she’d delayed signing, hoping to use the offer as leverage to convince her boss to give her a bigger raise. Now, she suspects she might end up with nothing.  “I should have signed the paper,” she says with a sigh. “But who knows?” For many business owners, the outbreak has felt like a Catch-22 situation: They have to restart operations, since the shutdown has put them in dire financial straits, but returning to normal business is almost impossible due to the ongoing disruptions. Ye Fang, who runs a chemicals company, went back to his Shanghai office Monday, as his clients want updates on the status of their orders. The 56-year-old, however, is still waiting for government approval to restart his factory in Anhui, a province to the west of Shanghai. “We can’t resume business unless we have prepared ‘enough’ face masks,” says Ye, whose factory employs 300 people. According to Ye, he stocked up on disinfectant, thermometers, and protective uniforms during the holiday. But there are shortages of face masks all over China, and he’s having to turn to overseas buyers for help.  “All we can do now is wait,” says Ye. “Once I receive the masks, I can ask for the local authorities’ approval to resume operations.” For now, Ye is having his 10-strong sales team in Shanghai work in rolling shifts, two at a time, to minimize the risk of infection. He would normally be making regular trips to Anhui, supervising work in the factory. But given the circumstances, he says he doesn’t dare risk the train journeys. “If the first week has been so difficult, I can’t imagine what the rest of the year will be like,” says Ye. “I hope everything will recover soon.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005193
Racism in the Time of Coronavirus,Rising deaths and infections have been accompanied by a disturbing global surge in xenophobia against ethnic Chinese people and others of Asian descent.,2020-02-13,"These days, a Chinese person coughing or sneezing in public can incite panic among those around them. It’s an unfortunate reality that Gu, a 20-something woman working in London, recently experienced firsthand when her friend came to visit from China. In late January, Gu’s friend had gone to a hospital in the British capital after developing a cough to make sure she hadn’t contracted the novel coronavirus. Days before the medical check, the woman had stayed at Gu’s home — so Gu thought she would relay word of the diagnosis to her roommates so they wouldn’t worry. The test was negative, but so was the reaction from one of Gu’s roommates. “He went crazy and verbally abused me,” Gu told Sixth Tone, using a pseudonym for fear of further reprisals from her roommate, who wasn’t satisfied with the test and demanded more evidence that the woman wasn’t sick. “At first, I thought he was just super scared, and I understand that,” she said. “But later, when I found out he didn’t want me to bring any of my friends (to the apartment), I realized it was racism.” In the two months since the novel coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, more insidious symptoms have spread forth from the epicenter: anxiety, fear, and, increasingly, discrimination. In China, residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, have become pariahs, while abroad, Chinese nationals — and even anyone who looks vaguely Asian — are being targeted with racist tropes and xenophobia. Anti-Asian sentiment, both online and offline, has spread nearly as fast as the virus, which as of Thursday had killed over 1,300 people in China and infected more than 60,000 worldwide.  In Canada, a mother said kids at school had chased and cornered her half-Chinese son to “test” him for the coronavirus. And in the United States, the coronavirus is impacting Asian-owned businesses amid a surge in racial profiling and prejudice against people of Asian descent, even in cities with no confirmed cases of the virus. In the city of Manchester in the United Kingdom, ethnically Chinese people have been maligned as “poisoned by the virus.” In Rome, Chinese people were prohibited from entering a bar near the Trevi Fountain, one of the city’s iconic tourist sites, supposedly due to “international security regulations.” Coronavirus-related discrimination is not limited to the West, either, with anti-Chinese rhetoric ramping up in South Korea and Japan, where some businesses have started putting up signs reading “No Chinese Allowed” in hopes of reducing infection risks. Some restaurants in Hong Kong are even refusing to serve Mandarin speakers as the number of coronavirus cases in the city soars. According to Lyle Fearnley, an assistant professor of anthropology at Singapore University of Technology and Design, societies see the need to identify sources of disorder as a moral imperative — and this applies to more than epidemics. “There’s a lot of social science about how this takes place in all sorts of different domains such as disasters, environmental pollution … risk in general,” Fearnley told Sixth Tone. “We respond to risk by wanting to turn it into a moral question of who might be responsible.” Historically, foreign powers have disparaged China as a breeding ground for infectious diseases. In the 1870s, San Francisco’s squalid Chinatown was viewed as “a laboratory of infection,” culminating in a deadly outbreak of bubonic plague in the city beginning in 1900. Over a century later, the SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people worldwide, fueling prejudice against Chinese people — especially regarding eating and hygiene habits. Now, 17 years after SARS, the public eye is again trained on China’s wet markets, with one in Wuhan believed to be the current epidemic’s ground zero. Weeks after the first infections were officially reported, a video of a young Chinese woman devouring bat soup went viral, prompting many to blame the outbreak on exotic wildlife consumption in China and other parts of Asia. On Jan. 26, three central government departments in China announced the suspension of the country’s wildlife trade for the duration of the epidemic.  On a recent trip to India, Cathy Li came across a nationally distributed magazine that she says made her feel “uncomfortable.” In an interview with The Week, the president of India’s Public Health Foundation said that “Chinese eat a variety of wild animals” — suggesting, Li felt, that this was the reason for the novel coronavirus outbreak. “I find the ‘Chinese people eat a lot of wild animals’ thing to be a bit racist,” Li told Sixth Tone. “It’s a well-circulated magazine here, so it’s also helping to (exacerbate) this blind panic.”  Adia Benton, an associate professor of anthropology specializing in global public health at Northwestern University in the U.S., said there is a history of “scapegoating Chinese people with respect to disease,” a problem that stems in part from immigration-related anxiety and perceived cultural differences. “Those perceived cultural differences tend to be articulated in terms of the foods Chinese people eat, ‘hygiene’ practices, and interpersonal interactions,” Benton told Sixth Tone. “Cultural difference is pathologized — in both literal and metaphorical senses.” Media coverage of the coronavirus may also have contributed to the emergence of racist tropes. The Wall Street Journal ran an opinion piece that described China as “the real sick man of Asia,” a term rooted in imperialism and shame. And continuing to refer to the epidemic being caused by a “China virus” or the “Wuhan coronavirus” — a trap we at Sixth Tone initially fell into — risks unfairly stigmatizing entire communities, experts say.  Earlier this month, the German magazine Der Spiegel ran a cover story characterizing the coronavirus as “Made in China,” a move that was widely slammed as insensitive. The Chinese Embassy in Berlin condemned the magazine, saying “epidemic outbreaks must not be used as an excuse for discrimination and xenophobia.” On Tuesday, the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as the name for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan. “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,” the head of the global health authority explained in an accompanying statement. Christophe Hu, a member of an association for French people of Chinese descent, acknowledges that fears of the coronavirus are legitimate but blames some French media outlets for spreading inaccurate information and being quick to deploy racist labels from the past. For example, the French newspaper Courrier Picard used the phrase alerte jaune — or “yellow alert,” a term referring to fear of Asian migration in the West — in a headline. The paper apologized following public backlash. “Some media called it the ‘Chinese virus,’ which is confusing and might (suggest) that all Chinese people might have the virus,” Hu told Sixth Tone. Hu’s association has received around 20 emails from people sharing their recent experiences with xenophobia — from students being called “Corona” to people being turned away from shops because of their appearance. “Ordinary racism against people of Asian descent existed before, which is now enhanced by the coronavirus,” Hu said. Fearnley, the anthropologist, said that continuing to associate the outbreak with its place of origin is not only problematic from a moral perspective, but also because it isn’t constructive for containing the virus. “By now it has spread to other places. There’s a problem with this idea of a close association with the origin point,” he said. “It may distort efforts to (contain) the outbreak effectively, (causing us) not to respond to the changing nature of it.”  Since Chinese authorities first reported cases of a mysterious pneumonia to the WHO in late December, more than two dozen countries and regions have reported some 490 cases, nearly half of which are on a cruise liner under quarantine off the coast of Japan. Looking to stop the coronavirus from arriving at their doorstep, some foreign governments have imposed travel restrictions targeting China. The United States and Australia, among others, have advised citizens not to travel to the country, while also banning noncitizens from entry if they have been in China within the past 14 days.  Mongolia, Russia, and North Korea have sealed off their land borders with China, while India has canceled visas already issued to Chinese citizens, as well as other foreigners who recently visited China. India, which so far has three confirmed cases of the coronavirus, has also stopped accepting e-visa applications from Chinese people and foreign nationals applying from China. Over 20 airlines have canceled all China flights as a precaution against the virus and to comply with reduced passenger volume to the country. Benton of Northwestern University said that such barriers and travel restrictions “reflect the underlying martial politics of public health,” and are a way for foreign governments to conspicuously assert their authority. “I am not sure if they (travel restrictions) always heighten panic and discrimination, but it seems likely that this happens,” Benton said. “Given the nature of the virus — there may be asymptomatic infections, mild cases, and so on — the restrictions may do little more than ease (some) governments’ perceived loss of control.”  Over a month into the epidemic, experts from around the world are racing to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus — a process that could take up to a year and a half, according to the WHO. In the meantime, many people are coming up with creative ways to combat the increasingly pervasive xenophobia and racism, such as through social media campaigns like #IAmNotAVirus. Lina, an undergraduate studying in the German town of Marburg, said she hoped both the outbreak and the racism it has inspired will pass soon. In the past few weeks, the Zhejiang native said she has been called “Coronavirus” at least three times during her regular commutes.  “I was a little angry because I didn’t feel good. I’m a person, not a virus,” said Lina, who asked to be identified by the name she uses among her friends in Germany. “But I really don’t care much now,” she said. “Most of my friends are really supportive and care about me and my family back home. There are many more people who are better than (a few racist ones).”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005187
"In Virus-Stricken Hubei, Locals Keep Hospitals Supplied","After citywide lockdowns brought much of Hubei province to a standstill, local volunteers provided overstretched hospitals with vital support. But the government is now starting to seize back control.",2020-02-12,"Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic, has been under lockdown since Jan. 23, but local resident Du Xiaohu has spent much of the past three weeks on the road. The 33-year-old hotel marketing manager has become an unofficial taxi driver during the outbreak, ferrying doctors, nurses, and medical supplies to overstretched and undersupplied hospitals across his hometown. Du is one of thousands of local people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province who have mobilized to prop up the virus-stricken region’s creaking health system, which is dealing with an unprecedented crisis. Of the 1,113 coronavirus-related deaths confirmed on the Chinese mainland as of Wednesday morning, 1,068 have taken place in Hubei. The grassroots relief groups have played a vital role in helping hospitals deal with the shutdown of almost all air, rail, and road transportation in over 15 cities across Hubei, which has made it difficult for medical workers and supplies to reach local health centers. But local authorities are now starting to take back control from some of the small-scale teams as officials try to restore order.  Hubei’s residents began organizing themselves within hours of Wuhan’s lockdown taking effect, using social media platforms WeChat and Weibo, as well as the Google Docs-like collaboration tool Shimo to connect volunteers with in-need hospitals and medical staff. Du joined one such group Jan. 24, the day after the lockdown, after seeing videos on Douyin — China’s TikTok — of hospital staff struggling to return home after their shifts. In a couple of hours, he was driving to a toll booth outside the city center to pick up a nurse trying to enter Wuhan from Huanggang, a city 75 kilometers away. “We arrived at the hospital and she wanted to pay me, but I refused,” Du tells Sixth Tone. Voluntary chauffeurs like Du have provided a vital supplement to the emergency measures enacted in Wuhan in the wake of the lockdown. Ride-sharing firm Didi Chuxing has made 200 drivers available to transport medical personnel for free, while local residential committees are organizing rides for residents. Almost all private cars are banned from the roads in Wuhan as part of the government’s efforts to prevent further infections. But traffic police are making exceptions for most volunteers carrying health workers and much-needed products like face masks, hazmat-style protective suits, and disinfectant, according to Du. He brings documents from donors and hospitals with him whenever possible, to convince law enforcement to let him pass. The volunteers are taking real risks by being in constant contact with doctors serving on the frontlines of the outbreak. One volunteer driver died after being infected with the virus in early February. Du tries to protect himself by wearing a face mask and protective suit — which a passenger gave him on his fifth day of driving — and disinfecting his car multiple times a day.  “People are worried about getting infected, but personally I feel it’s fine,” says Du. “I feel that I should do this.” Grassroots groups have been particularly important in Hubei’s smaller cities, which have weaker health systems and have received less aid than Wuhan. Guo Fei, a 27-year-old entrepreneur from Xiaogan, a city of 5 million some 60 kilometers northwest of Wuhan, knew that his hometown might struggle with the crisis as soon as he heard about the lockdown in Hubei’s provincial capital. Within days, reports began to emerge that hospitals across Hubei were indeed running low on supplies, as transportation systems ground to a halt all over the province. Doctors in Xiaogan told Al Jazeera that they had run out of protective gear and were resorting to covering their eyes with material torn from plastic bags. Though he was stuck over 1,000 kilometers away in Shenzhen, the southern tech hub where he runs a business, Guo rallied his friends and family members to help hospitals in Xiaogan procure essential equipment. “Initially, there was basically no deployment of supplies, and hospitals were having to rely completely on their reserves, which were insufficient,” Guo tells Sixth Tone.  Guo created a group on WeChat and invited volunteers and doctors in the city to join. Within three days, the group had managed to acquire 770,000 yuan ($110,000) in protective suits and face masks. The supplies were secured just days after the Xiaogan government launched its own response. The city made its first call for public donations Jan. 24, and formally launched coordinated emergency measures the next day, according to a Xiaogan official surnamed Song, who spoke to Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity. The rapid proliferation of grassroots relief groups is part of a wider trend toward bypassing official charities during the crisis. Though the majority of the estimated 17.2 billion yuan in public donations raised to fight the outbreak as of Feb. 3 has gone to state-designated organizations, public anger over reports of mismanagement at Hubei’s Red Cross Society has led a growing number of people to give to smaller organizations. Luo Xin, a blogger and small business owner, tells Sixth Tone she chose to donate funds to Guo, rather than an official charity. She has also observed more donors giving directly to hospitals via digital payment apps. “It might look a bit dull and troublesome this way, but we’re connected with doctors and volunteers on the ground,” says Luo, who lives in New Jersey. “We can see that our donations work.”  Experts say civil groups like Guo’s have been vital for plugging gaps in the government’s relief efforts, especially in local communities where the lockdown has placed vulnerable groups — such as those with chronic health conditions — in difficult situations. “The role civil society organizations have played has been helpful and urgently needed,” Du Junfei, a professor of political communication at Nanjing University, tells Sixth Tone in a written statement. “The scattered civil relief forces have helped ensure the survival of some members of minority groups.” But organizations like Guo’s are fighting an uphill battle as the number of people infected by the virus in Hubei continues to climb. There were over 33,000 confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the province as of Wednesday. Guo’s group works with around 50 volunteers and over 60 hospitals and health centers. He has suspended operations at his startup to focus exclusively on the relief effort and says he’s barely had a good night’s sleep since Jan. 23. Yet Xiaogan has the highest number of cases of any city in China after Wuhan. Some volunteers are beginning to question how long they can go on. Liu Ming, a Wuhan resident, spent the past two weeks driving medical supplies around the city. Now, however, he says he plans to quit, citing burnout. “I think the shortage of medical supplies has not eased but increased,” says Liu, who manages local Airbnb venues. “There’s really nothing further we’re capable of doing.” Coordinating the efforts of a dispersed network of volunteers, most of which have no experience in professional charity work, has proved challenging for many. Some volunteer organizations have even faced accusations of mismanagement of their own.  As the lockdown approaches its three-week anniversary, Chinese authorities are ramping up relief efforts and gradually easing out grassroots groups, particularly from hospital supply chains. All the factories supplying Guo’s group with medical equipment told Guo Feb. 8 that they had been ordered only to sell to official procurement agencies from now on. The group is currently in the process of transferring all its stock to a government-controlled storehouse. “This was also our plan in the first place,” says Guo. “My original intention was to provide help during an emergency situation. When the government didn’t respond quickly, we civilians could help medical staff secure supplies. Now, I’m wrapping up my operation and passing the baton to the government.” Central and provincial governments are working with manufacturers to increase production of face masks and protective suits and ensure Hubei gets priority when it comes to distributing essential medical supplies, according to state-run Hubei Daily. Some hospitals in Xiaogan, however, remain short of protective equipment, which get quickly used up, according to Guo.  “The production capacity of the (medical equipment) factories and their efficient deployment by the government are the keys to solving the shortages,” says Guo. According to Jia Xijin, vice dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for Philanthropy, the government’s decision to monopolize control of medical supplies is no surprise, given the widespread shortages and the nature of China’s governance system. “It (the government) definitely wants to impose unified distribution of limited resources,” says Jia. “These grassroots volunteer groups can change their strategies in terms of how to play a role in it (the relief efforts).” Jia has concerns, however, that there haven't been enough discussions on how to make the management of the relief efforts more efficient. “The response to the current epidemic has been mainly political,” says Jia. Du, the Wuhan-based volunteer, is still transporting medical equipment for now. He says he had a moment of frustration last Saturday, after traffic police refused to allow him to pick up a delivery without official papers. Minutes later, however, he received a message saying there were 100 protective suits in a storehouse across town. Du headed straight there.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005185
A Brief History of Face Masks in China,The country’s faith in masks is partly a product of early 20th century public health campaigns.,2020-02-12,"It’s usually not a good sign when the most in-demand accessory of the season is a face mask. With China battling an outbreak of a novel coronavirus — the newly named COVID-19 — that has already killed 1,114 and sickened 44,000 as of Feb. 12, face mask factories around the country have been working overtime for weeks to keep up with demand. Yet supplies remain scarce enough that local governments are requisitioning shipments bound for other cities, and residents in some areas need to register for state-issued vouchers if they hope to get their hands on some. Between widespread air pollution and the occasional infectious disease outbreak, images of Chinese people in face masks have become a kind of visual shorthand for some of the problems that have emerged over the past 40 years of breakneck development. Yet for all their seeming ubiquity, convincing the public to actually wear the masks is an ongoing project. In the early days of the current outbreak, netizens left a wave of online comments complaining about the difficulty of getting their parents and older relatives to put on masks when going out. The masks you do see on China’s streets are products of a conscious, centurylong campaign to improve national hygiene and health standards. Long before the development of anything that resembled a face mask, Chinese simply covered their mouths with either their sleeves or hands. This method was both unsanitary and occasionally inconvenient, however, and the more affluent eventually started using silk cloth instead. In the 13th century, Italian explorer Marco Polo recounted how servants in the Yuan dynasty court were required to cover their noses and mouths with a cloth of silk and gold thread when serving food to the emperor. The surgical masks in use today are a Western import. The use of masks in medical procedures dates back at least to 1897, but they were not widely adopted by the Chinese medical community until the early 20th century.  In late 1910, the legendary Malaysian-Chinese doctor Wu Lien-teh was serving as China’s chief medical officer when an epidemic broke out in Northeast China. Wu went deep into the affected areas to lead prevention and control work, and soon identified the epidemic as a form of pneumonic plague spread by droplets in the air. In addition to proposing now-familiar-sounding measures — including quarantining patients and cordoning off many cities — Wu also designed and invented a cheap sanitary face mask that promised some protection from the disease. Made of widely available surgical gauze folded around a 4-by-6 inch piece of cotton, it could be wrapped around the back of the head and tied in a knot. Simple and easy-to-make, it was affordable enough for almost anyone to buy. China’s doctors and nurses continued using Wu’s design throughout the 20th century, improving it here and there but making no substantial changes. It wasn’t until the 2003 outbreak of SARS, which infected hundreds of medical workers and showed the limitations of traditional cotton masks, that the then-China Food and Drug Administration retired Wu’s mask in favor of newer, more effective models. But medical professionals aren’t the only Chinese to routinely wear face masks. During the Republican era (1912-1949), China experienced wave after wave of cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid, scarlet fever, measles, malaria, and dysentery. Shanghai saw 12 outbreaks of cholera between 1912 and 1948, six of them major. In 1938 alone, the city reported 11,365 cases, and 2,246 people died. As far as the country’s health authorities were concerned, one of the easiest and cheapest means of preventing these outbreaks was getting people to wear masks. In 1929, the government responded to a meningitis outbreak that began in Shanghai and soon swept across the entire country by encouraging citizens to don masks and avoid public gatherings. Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, in China’s then-capital, sold face masks to public servants and ordinary residents alike. In small towns like Pinghu in the eastern Zhejiang province, residents could collect face masks for free. In cosmopolitan Shanghai, face masks were promoted as fashion accessories to encourage their use. In response to the meningitis outbreak, well-known journalist Yan Duhe discussed the importance of wearing masks in a 1929 column for the newspaper Xinwen Bao titled, “The Most Fashionable Spring Accessory: A Black Face Mask.” In it, Yan suggested that drugstores should set aside profits and sell items necessary for epidemic prevention, including masks, at cost. He also recommended the government recruit famous celebrities and socialites to wear masks at spring fashion shows as a means of boosting popular acceptance. Contemporary magazines often portrayed women in masks as exemplars of good hygiene, turning the coverings into a status symbol connoting membership in the city’s educated upper crust. Other outlets produced tutorials that taught housewives how to knit their own wool masks to use in the winter.  With the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, face masks became essential protection against chemical and biological warfare. Magazines such as the Red Cross Society of China Newsletter, Air Defense Monthly, and Student Magazine began publishing articles on how to improve face masks by dousing gauze in chemicals like urotropin, sodium carbonate, and ammonium thioate — a combination that would supposedly provide protection against poison gas. The evidence is mixed as to whether masks — even high-tech variants like the N95 — provide protection against COVID-19. But over the past century, Chinese have relied on face masks to shield them from disease, chemical warfare, and pollution. In the absence of better options, we may have to do so again.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005177
Who Is Paying for Coronavirus Patients’ Treatment?,"The Chinese government has vowed that no one will be left out of pocket for coronavirus-related medical care, but is such a promise feasible?",2020-02-12,"It was a tense night for Lin Guihua and her family. On Sunday, the 56-year-old Wuhan resident finally managed to secure a hospital bed for her husband, who is gravely ill with the coronavirus that has ravaged the city. At around 11 p.m., the local neighborhood committee arranged for Lin’s husband to be taken to Tongji Hospital in the city’s Caidian District. Once there, Lin waited for over an hour, only to be told that her husband could not be admitted without a health insurance card, which he does not have. In January, China’s central government vowed to provide free medical care to people infected with the coronavirus — rhetoric that would be expanded to also cover suspected cases. The state, officials decreed, would cover 60% of local governments’ treatment costs. Wuhan authorities, too, have stressed that diagnosed patients should expect to be relieved of all treatment costs: Hospitals in the central Chinese city now admit patients without charging upfront fees, instead keeping detailed records for future reimbursement. With the herculean task of securing a bed at one of Wuhan’s overstretched hospitals managed, Lin was crushed by the prospect of being bested by a wallet-sized piece of plastic. Fortunately, hospital staff informed her at around 5 a.m. that her husband’s government ID card would suffice — though by that point she had already run home to fetch her own medical insurance card in case it might help with the formalities. Though such rigid registration procedures are a source of unwanted headaches for Lin and people like her, they’re essential for hospitals hoping to avoid headaches of their own in the months to come, when they will be seeking payment for endless medical procedures and overtime hours. Treatment first, payment later During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, the Chinese government mandated that hospitals should treat patients first and settle bills later, requiring local governments to pick up the slack. In Shenzhen, SARS patients were asked to pay 10% of their total treatment costs, while in Beijing, where the epidemic killed over 190 people, the municipal government offered full reimbursement to anyone under the urban health insurance scheme — though proof of a positive diagnosis was required. According to the Hubei Healthcare Security Administration, the body that oversees the province’s medical insurance system, confirmed coronavirus patients will be completely covered by a combination of standard medical insurance and government financial support. “For confirmed cases, 100% of the treatment fees are reimbursed (to the patients), while suspected cases follow the normal medical insurance system,” an official surnamed Li from the healthcare security administration in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital, told Sixth Tone. She added, however, that any outpatient fees or medicines purchased prior to a patient being hospitalized would not be covered. According to Li, reimbursement will be systematically carried out later, though no timetable has been set. For now, the chief responsibility of Li and her colleagues is simply to keep records. However, another official from the Wuhan administration surnamed Zheng later said that both suspected and confirmed cases in the city would be eligible for free treatment, including having their outpatient fees reimbursed. The administration’s official website appears to confirm this, indicating that treatment costs for suspected cases are now included under standard medical insurance coverage. The site also says that the Wuhan government has allocated 700 million yuan ($100 million) in relief funding to local hospitals.  Jia Hu, the pseudonym of a 21-year-old college student in Wuhan, was diagnosed with the coronavirus on Jan. 29. He told Sixth Tone that because his symptoms were mild, he merely took the medication prescribed to him by hospitals.  “We paid for the drugs, and I’m sure we’ll get reimbursed later — it’s just that the channel hasn’t been announced yet,” said Jia, who is under quarantine at a hotel after slowly recovering from the infection. According to Zheng, all medications stipulated by the National Health Commission should be covered. This list has been expanded, too, with official notices saying that additional drugs and medical procedures are now paid for in light of the current epidemic. In most parts of China, full reimbursement for both diagnosed and suspected coronavirus patients appears to be the norm. At least nine provincial-level regions, including Beijing and Guangdong, have been unequivocal in promising free treatment for anyone affected by the coronavirus. Housing Funds Can Go Toward Medical Fees — Or Can’t They? Despite the government’s grand declarations of free treatment for all, some have their doubts about whether patients will still need to pay out of pocket. Confusion arose after a central government agency announced on Feb. 3 that working people could withdraw housing funds from their social welfare accounts to pay for treatment costs. Most employers in China pay into a housing fund for their employees each month to help pay their rent or mortgage; occasionally, however, these funds can be allocated to help families cope with serious illnesses. After the announcement, some online expressed what they viewed as a contradiction: Unlike medical insurance payments, which get reimbursed, the housing fund represents a person’s “hard-earned money,” one user argued on microblogging platform Weibo. For her part, Li of the Wuhan Healthcare Security Administration said she was not aware of a directive to work with the local housing fund bureau, and a spokesperson from Beijing’s medical security bureau told Sixth Tone that she hadn’t heard of housing funds being used to pay medical bills. Employees at two banks where Beijing residents can withdraw from their housing funds told Sixth Tone that while they had seen the official notice, there were no signs of it being enforced.  Payment policies may vary from province to province, but the same can be said for how patients are reimbursed through the standard medical insurance system. “Treatment costs for pneumonia patients are completely covered in Jilin,” an official surnamed Wu at the northeastern province’s healthcare security administration told Sixth Tone. “We don’t need the extra withdrawal of housing funds; we can fully cover their treatment costs.” According to Wu, Jilin pays for the treatment — including expenses for medication and outpatient fees prior to hospitalization — of its coronavirus patients, confirmed or suspected. The government disburses funds to designated coronavirus hospitals preemptively, Wu said, so there is no need for patients to settle any bills themselves. Back in 2003, however, some overburdened hospitals faced financial crises after prepaying tens of thousands of yuan for treatment and then failing to receive government subsidies or payments from patients in a timely manner. Although there is currently no policy in writing that delineates the scale of reimbursements for coronavirus patients, “free for all” may actually be realistic thanks to added medical relief funds, according to Chen Qiaoshan, a medical industry analyst at market research firm Analysys. “They (local authorities) are heeding the call of the National Healthcare Security Administration,” Chen told Sixth Tone. “It seems to be localized — that is to say, you address the bill at the hospital that admits you, and then you are reimbursed the specified proportion, with (the medical relief fund) taking care of the rest.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005178
Collage: Shanghai’s First Day Back to Work,Sixth Tone takes a trip through the city as the extended holiday ends and people gear up for work while epidemic prevention continues.,2020-02-11,"More than two weeks after the Shanghai government decided to extend the Lunar New Year holiday, the city is ushering people back to the offices on its first official working day.  Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, reported that Shanghai’s metro and the bus system had 1.45 million and 0.97 million visits yesterday, respectively, both of which were less than 20% of their workday traffic before the epidemic. On West Nanjing Road, one of the main business areas in Shanghai, most of the stores have reopened, still attracting scant customers. Given the city’s highest-level emergency response to the novel coronavirus, several employees continue to work remotely, and the rest greet each other behind face masks.

Tencent's Coronavirus-Tracking Platform Gets Mixed Reviews,"While some say revealing a patient’s diagnostic status is in the public interest, others argue it’s infringing upon their privacy.",2020-02-11,"In China, people can now check online to see if there are coronavirus patients near them. Leading tech giant Tencent has launched an online platform that allows users to locate confirmed coronavirus cases in more than 140 cities nationwide. The platform, dubbed the Novel Coronavirus Community Compounds Search Map, has been available on Tencent Maps and messaging app WeChat since Saturday, and uses official data from local health authorities to mark residential communities with confirmed coronavirus cases and show their distance from the user. Other companies and media organizations including Qihoo 360, Sogou, and Yicai have launched similar platforms for locating confirmed coronavirus cases. A Beijing resident who spoke to Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity said she checks the official updates daily and occasionally uses Tencent’s new feature and similar platforms to see where infections have been reported. However, she said she is sometimes concerned about privacy, as users are required to accept the platforms’ geotagging permission requests. “I gave them access to my location because I want to see (the information),” she said. “But in general, I don’t really like this.” Chinese tech companies like Tencent and Alibaba have been doing their part to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by updating official information, raising awareness about the illness, and donating funds to help the country combat the epidemic. The outbreak has so far killed more than 1,000 people in China and infected over 42,000 globally. As authorities try to contain the outbreak, there have been multiple reports of patients being outed on government and social media platforms. While some returning to their hometowns from the outbreak’s epicenter of Wuhan have found their personal details circulating online, governments in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Shenzhen and Guangzhou, have started to reveal the names of communities and places with confirmed patients on their official websites.  Individuals and experts say they are worried about such personal information being shared online either by tech companies or the authorities. Chen Yinjiang, deputy secretary-general of the China Consumer Protection Law Society, told Sixth Tone that geolocation platforms like the one launched by Tencent could be double-edged swords. While they may provide key information related to the outbreak, they also risk revealing too much data. “If it is based on information released by authoritative departments, I don’t think it’s a big problem,” Chen said. “But if patients’ information is collected privately and inaccurately, it may not only violate their personal privacy, but also mislead the public and cause unnecessary panic that could affect the prevention and control of the epidemic.” Meanwhile, others argue that disclosing people’s private information is necessary, given that the coronavirus epidemic presents an unprecedented public health crisis. “Many places in China have launched Level 1 emergency responses, indicating the urgency and seriousness of the epidemic,” Peng Feng, a researcher at the Institute of Law of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told The Paper, Sixth Tone’s sister publication. “In cases of major public interest, the privacy of individual citizens should take a back seat.” A resident of Enshi, a county-level city in Hubei over 500 kilometers from Wuhan, the provincial capital, told Sixth Tone on condition of anonymity that she checks for daily updates on the epidemic but has rarely used the maps to locate confirmed cases. “I generally don’t check the maps, because if there is a case nearby, in a small city (like ours), everyone will spread (the information),” she said, adding that neighborhood committees have a tendency to dish out the details in online chat groups. Chen said disseminating information that includes specific community and building numbers could help property management and cleaning staff take precautionary measures. However, he added that details such as a patient’s name, photo, phone number, and ID number should be withheld from the public domain. “On the one hand, users must authorize the platforms to access their locations,” he said. “On the other hand, people should use discretion when providing their personal information (in order to) avoid unnecessary trouble.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005184
Wuhan’s Much-Maligned Virology Institute Seeks Patent on US Drug,"After being criticized for inaction early in the coronavirus epidemic, China’s top virus lab is under fire for rushing to secure the usage patent for a drug it didn’t develop.",2020-02-11,"A virology institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences is facing criticism after revealing that it applied for a patent on the use of a U.S.-developed drug to treat the novel coronavirus. Remdesivir, developed by California-based pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, has not been approved anywhere in the world, though it has shown promising results in some laboratory studies. As its inventor, Gilead holds the patent for remdesivir’s chemical formula — though under general patent rules, other companies can still apply for patents on different uses of the drug, as long as those uses are novel and not obvious. Patents and the Problem of Optics On Chinese social media, some people view the virology institute’s move as a callous cash grab after it failed to warn and protect the people of Wuhan. “(The institute) is slow at figuring out whether the virus is contagious but pretty fast at filing patent applications,” wrote one user on microblogging platform Weibo. “The Wuhan Institute of Virology can take care of everything except sounding the alarm and treating disease,” wrote another. The virology institute filed the remdesivir usage patent on Jan. 21 — several days before the drug was used to relieve symptoms in a coronavirus patient in the U.S., and two weeks before clinical trials began in Wuhan on Feb. 3. In the absence of clear solutions, Chinese health authorities and medical workers have been eyeing powerful antiviral drugs, including ones used to fight HIV, in hopes that they might also be effective against the novel coronavirus. “They want a placeholder,” Jerry Xia, a lawyer specializing in patent law at Anjie Law Firm in Shanghai, told Sixth Tone. “Patent filings are always first come, first served — so it’s quite understandable (that the institute did this). The patent could become the institute’s leverage in future negotiations.” If the usage patent application is approved, Gilead may not be able to sell its own drug for the purpose of treating the novel coronavirus without the institute’s consent, Xia said — though it’s also possible that the institute may not be allowed to manufacture the drug in China without Gilead’s license. “In this situation, the two parties would probably have to come to some kind of agreement,” he said.  Remdesivir has not been proved safe or effective for treating the novel coronavirus, Gilead said in a statement to Sixth Tone. “We believe any discussion of compulsory or other types of licensing is premature,” the company said. “We have not had any discussions with authorities about supply, manufacturing costs, or remuneration for Gilead.” In 2016, the California company applied for — but has yet to be granted — a patent in China on using remdesivir to treat coronaviruses. However, this does not necessarily cover the full umbrella, as subsequent usage patents against specific coronaviruses such as SARS, MERS, or 2019-nCoV could still be issued to entities like the Wuhan Institute of Virology. According to Xia, it is unclear whether the institute’s application will be approved because the details have not been made public. “They would need to provide sufficient data to prove that the drug is effective in treating the novel coronavirus,” he said. “A patent normally takes several years to be approved, unless a special green channel is used. By that time, the epidemic would likely be over.” With High Biosafety Levels Come High Expectations The reputation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has taken a few hits since news of the outbreak first started circulating in early January. As the number of confirmed cases began to rise each day, resentment simmered on Chinese social media, with many criticizing the institute for not responding appropriately and promptly to the outbreak. “I don’t think (the institute) did its due diligence,” said Huang Yanzhong, a global health expert specializing in China at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. The Wuhan Institute of Virology houses China’s only Biosafety Level 4 lab — a facility for studying the world’s most dangerous infectious diseases, such as the Ebola and Marburg viruses. After construction on the BSL-4 lab was completed in 2015, Li Bin, the head of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said the new facility “would provide important technological support for preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases, public health emergency responses, and new drug development.”  To Huang, however, the virology institute’s handling of the current crisis has been a letdown. “The lab specializes in virus research and is located at the epicenter — yet it seems to me that the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Chinese CDC, and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences did most of the work in sequencing the coronavirus’ genome,” Huang told Sixth Tone. In a statement released Jan. 29, the Wuhan Institute of Virology said it had sequenced the entire genome of the novel coronavirus on Jan. 2. But the Chinese public was not informed of the successful sequencing until Jan. 10, when a research group led by scientists from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Fudan University published their data. So far, the virology institute has provided no evidence to support its claim of genome-sequencing primacy. Minimum Qualification: A Good Marriage In addition to criticism of the virology institute itself, people have also expressed doubts about the competency of its leader. Several articles widely circulated on social app WeChat have accused Wang Yanyi, the institute’s director-general, of having a weak academic background and ascending to her post through nepotism at a relatively young age. Some suspect Wang was only picked to lead the institute because of her husband, who is an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the virology institute’s former director. According to the institute’s website, Wang has published 28 papers in top academic journals while her subordinate, the deputy director, has published over 60. “What we are feeling now — disoriented and torn apart — is all because of the nepotism that put Wang where she is now,” one of the WeChat articles said. Cherry-Picked Details Do Not a Conspiracy Prove Public disillusionment with the virology institute has also given way to conspiracy theories. Following a report from a fringe media site in the U.S., stories about whether the coronavirus was engineered and leaked by Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus specialist at the institute, have gained traction on Chinese social media. Some netizens point to a 2015 study in which Shi and her team described how they had isolated a coronavirus found in bats and made it infectious to humans by manipulating a key protein. Scientists have slammed that theory as bunkum. “The idea borders on the absurd,” John Swartzberg, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Berkeley told Sixth Tone. “These are conspiracy theories. They are rooted in mischief and paranoia.” In an interview last week, Shi told Chinese media outlet Caixin that she had no intention of discussing technical subjects with non-experts, as doing so would be a waste of time. “All I can tell you is that our experiments follow the relevant laws and regulations,” she said. When Sixth Tone contacted the Wuhan Institute of Virology for comment, a staff member said no one was allowed to speak to the public or press without approval from higher authorities.   According to Li Jing, a sociologist at Zhejiang University in eastern China, rumors such as those surrounding the virology institute are often based on preconceived ideas — that scientists exist to do the bidding of the Communist Party, for example. If scientists are being micromanaged by officials, they can’t work autonomously, Li told Sixth Tone. And if they’re trying to both serve the higher authorities and further their own careers, that hardly leaves room to consider the public interest, she added. “We’ve seen scientists make up data to get their papers published, or write papers that don’t help us understand the truth or advance humankind,” Li said. “That’s why these rumors challenging their authority have become so pervasive.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005169
Housebound Chinese Cope With Being Cooped Up,"Parts of over 30 cities have limited residents’ ability to leave their homes as China battles the novel coronavirus, but the effectiveness of such policies remains in question.",2020-02-10,"For many Chinese, the 2020 Lunar New Year holiday has been an exercise in boredom bordering on absurdity. Almost three weeks into what was supposed to be a one-week break, there are signs that the country is gradually starting to creak back to life. But tens of millions remain under varying degrees of mandatory quarantine in their apartments, rural hometowns, and occasionally in between, while a number of provinces, cities, and businesses have announced plans to suspend work and school until at least March 1. Faced with an epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) that has killed over 800 people and sickened 40,000 across the country since December, local officials are under intense pressure to keep the disease from spreading further. This has led a number of cities and regions to adopt so-called hardcore containment measures, from shutting down public spaces and putting up roadblocks to effectively barring the vast majority of residents from leaving their homes. On Feb. 1, the eastern city of Wenzhou, which had reported over 460 confirmed cases of NCP as of Monday, became one of the first localities outside of the outbreak’s epicenter in the central Hubei province to effectively impose a curfew on its residents. That day, the city issued a directive limiting excursions out of doors to “one designated member per household, every two days.” In the nine days since, districts in at least 30 more cities, including provincial capitals Hangzhou, Harbin, Fuzhou, and Nanjing, have implemented some form of residential curfew. In an extreme example, the central city of Zhumadian announced that each household would only be allowed to send a designated representative outside once every five days. Liu Shuiyi, a 24-year-old Harbin resident, told Sixth Tone on Thursday that she had not left her house in three days. “It’s hard to get groceries or walk the dog,” Liu said in a telephone interview. On Feb. 4, city officials instructed neighborhoods to limit excursions to a maximum of one person per household every two days, though the details of implementation were left up to the neighborhood authorities. While she sees the rules as an annoyance, Liu said she generally supports the policy, in part because she believes it can prevent the further spread of NCP. “I guess we will have to be tolerant, because Harbin’s coronavirus situation is quite serious,” she said. Harbin, a city of roughly 10 million located over 2,000 kilometers from the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan — or roughly the distance between Los Angeles and Dallas — had reported 128 NCP cases as of Monday. For those like Liu who own their own home and stayed in the city for the holiday, the lockdown often means little more than being cooped up indoors. But for migrants returning from their distant hometowns, it can pose a far greater challenge. Yuan Yaru, a 28-year-old native of the central Henan province who works in the eastern city of Hangzhou, told Sixth Tone that her neighborhood’s quarantine policy has made it impossible for her to return. “I was planning to go back on Jan. 29, but the public transportation in my hometown was shut down. Then I tried to return on Feb. 3, only to be told that I am not allowed to go back anymore,” Yuan told Sixth Tone. “(My landlord) sent me the notice from the neighborhood committee.” When Sixth Tone called Yuan’s neighborhood committee late last week posing as a tenant trying to return home, a woman who answered the phone explained that from Feb. 5, all tenants who had left the compound for the break, including those who had gone home for the holiday, would not be allowed back in until a later date. When asked when that might be, the woman was unable give a definite answer. “The policy changes every day,” she said. A search of publicly available records shows a number of Hangzhou districts have recommended that landlords and neighborhoods “strongly dissuade” or outright forbid residents from returning home until Feb. 9 at the earliest. Yuan’s district is telling landlords to keep renters from returning “in the near term.” Yuan has an added reason to want to get back soon: She left her cat at home with only enough food to last for the planned duration of her trip. To resolve the situation, she eventually got in touch with a pet-loving volunteer in the city who agreed to help feed the cat for her. And while the provincial authorities rebuked local governments Sunday for adopting measures that “inconvenience” residents, she still doesn’t know when she’ll be allowed to return to Hangzhou. Meanwhile, experts caution that the evidence in favor of extreme containment policies is questionable at best. “The authorities are justifying their actions by claiming that they are the most effective means of controlling the spread of the virus,” said Todd Meyers, director of the Center for Society, Health, and Medicine at NYU Shanghai. “It is an open question whether or not it (quarantine) is the most effective means of control.” Meyers also highlighted the potential social risks of quarantine and lockdown policies. “I worry that the solution may be worse than the problem,” he said. “It’s not hard to imagine growing public resentment, which could ultimately undermine efforts to stop the spread of the virus.” Indeed, there are signs of a backlash brewing online, as residents complain of discrimination or even being locked in their homes without warning because they had previously traveled to regions hit hard by the epidemic. On Monday, the Hangzhou city government had to release a statement reminding neighborhoods and districts that “hardcore” containment measures such as blockading residential apartments or roads are forbidden. “The most aggressive forms of compulsory treatment and quarantine often fail to realize their aim,” Meyers said. “There is always a cost, not only to the individual but also to a society.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005167
‘Hardcore’ Quarantine Measures Risk Fracturing Social Cohesion,"As China battles the novel coronavirus outbreak, regions across the country are sealing themselves off. But we should be wary of the consequences of local protectionism.",2020-02-10,"This year, China celebrated Lunar New Year — the first of the new decade — with a soul-shaking jolt. In a country known for migration, both internal and external, the ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has brought life here almost to a standstill. In a rare move, the national government extended the Lunar New Year holiday as it dealt with the crisis, and local officials have since extended the extension, shutting down schools and keeping factories in their localities closed for weeks. To identify suspected carriers and reduce the chance of cross-infection, local governments have enacted rigorous health check requirements for public spaces and instituted mandatory quarantines for carriers, both suspected and confirmed. The fundamental goal of these measures is to bring the outbreak under control and eventually allow the country to resume operations in an orderly manner. But there’s been plenty of disorder, too. Some provinces and cities have adopted peculiar NIMBY-style epidemic control measures, unilaterally sealing off roads in an attempt to contain the virus, engaging in tit-for-tat requisitions of emergency supplies with other localities, and locking returning migrants in or out of their homes. While a number of netizens have praised these so-called hardcore preventative measures as necessary to contain the epidemic, it’s worth reflecting on the potential risk they pose to China’s economic and social order.  Take roadblocks, for example. The central government has long explicitly prohibited regions from sealing off roads. This was as true during the SARS epidemic 17 years ago as it is today. Roadblocks not only make it hard for ambulances to enter certain areas, but also for the critically ill to get out. They may even constitute a criminal offence if they damage transportation facilities. So why are so many springing up now? The proliferation of roadblocks across the country reflects each province’s growing sense of self-interest. After 40 years of uneven growth, the economic power and fiscal revenue of China's provinces has diverged significantly. Wealthy regions along the coast have the means to run fiscal surpluses, while the less-developed hinterland often relies on regular transfer payments from the central government.  This new pattern of wealth distribution has spawned different forms of local protectionism. Meanwhile, Chinese citizens may not have a say in their city or province’s political leadership, but officials know they are nonetheless somewhat responsible for the social and economic welfare of the people under their jurisdiction and are therefore inclined to protect the interests of local residents, even if it means upsetting interregional cooperation. But many of the measures currently being taken are short-sighted and reckless. First of all, not only will they not necessarily contain the epidemic — there is evidence quarantines don’t work — they will also inevitably exacerbate divisions between local residents and migrants, a long-running fault line in Chinese society. Since the beginning of the “reform and opening-up” period in the late 1970s, the percentage of Chinese living in urban areas has risen from 18% to over 60% — an immense internal migration. There are more than 7 million migrants with permanent residency in Beijing, nearly 10 million in Shanghai, and another 5 million in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Although they often face discrimination, migrants are essential to how Chinas cities function. The group includes college students as well as a huge percentage of workers in secondary and tertiary industries. Of course, as urban populations become increasingly dense, the risk of disasters — including epidemics — grows. But when faced with these risks, our first priority must be to protect all residents’ legitimate rights and interests, not just those of the local population, even if it complicates our emergency response efforts. Rash isolationist policies and tendencies also undermine the structure of the economy by weakening the ties between regional markets. In today’s market economy, with its high division of labor, provinces are far more interlinked and interdependent than ever before. China’s cities, large and small, are now connected by the world’s largest high-speed rail network. The country’s extensive logistics industry, as well as the infrastructure and consumption habits of the internet era, have also bolstered domestic market integration and reinforced the ties between local economies.  All of this is to say: Sealing off areas is never as simple as it seems. A major metropolitan area and center of global trade like Shanghai may think it’s equipped to go it alone, but it remains highly dependent on the rest of the country. This was shown in 2008, when a severe snowstorm in South China caused the price of vegetables in Shanghai to skyrocket. Agriculture accounts for less than 1% of Shanghai's GDP, meaning the city relies heavily on the nation’s main agricultural producers for food. However, the closure of roads during the snowstorm meant that Shanghai suddenly found itself dependent on its own extremely limited local supply. That January, the municipal ministry of finance was reduced to slashing all tolls on roads into the city in an attempt to get farmers to increase shipments. To lock out others is to lock yourself in. Our cities cannot function normally for extended periods if we seal off our communities from delivery workers and migrants; make white-collar workers work from home; and prohibit intercity commuting. The country’s social and economic structure is completely different than it was in the planned economy era, when local self-reliance was the watchword. We cannot undo the consequences of 40 years of urbanization in a fortnight. Sooner or later, more than 200 million migrant workers will eventually filter back into China’s cities, and the gargantuan machine that is our country will gradually stutter back to life. When that happens, appropriate and reasonable epidemic prevention measures will still be necessary. We cannot, however, resort to “hardcore” tactics that will exacerbate conflicts between local and migrant populations; widen the divide between rural and urban China; and destroy the integrated domestic market. And once the epidemic is under control, there will be much work to do to restore social order, solidarity, and trust. Population mobility is conducive to the spread of disease, but it is also a source of social dynamism. We must strike a balance between economic growth and social stability — or risk losing both.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005176
"Pets, Abandoned and Blamed, Struggle to Survive Virus Outbreak","Amid fears of the novel coronavirus believed to have originated in mammals, animal lovers are fighting for the rights of furry friends.",2020-02-08,"Du Fan had made plans to travel north and spend the Spring Festival holiday with friends amid wintery scenes of ice and snow. Instead, during a viral epidemic that began in his hometown Wuhan, Du is roaming a deserted city to break into strangers’ homes and rescue their pets. As the city — the capital of central China’s Hubei province and the epicenter of an outbreak that has killed over 700 people and infected more than 34,000 as of Feb. 8 — closed itself off from the outside world on Jan. 23 to halt the spreading virus, millions of Wuhan residents were out of town with no way home.  Across China, measures enacted to stop the spread of 2019-nCoV, as the coronavirus is known, have affected businesses, people — and animals. Pets have been blamed for spreading the virus, willingly abandoned amid the crisis, or unintentionally left to fend for themselves. Three days after the lockdown that put Wuhan’s roads, railways, and airport out of service, Du issued a notice on social media saying his nongovernmental organization Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association would help stranded pets for free. So far, the association has received more than 2,000 requests, mostly from people who expected to only be away for a few days and are now afraid their pets are running out of food and water. Du’s team of 28 volunteers are in a race against time, maneuvering through a city of 14 million without the use of cars or public transportation. They have so far managed to save more than 400 pets, mostly cats. Still, they’re receiving more new requests than they can handle. “We will keep doing this until the city is unlocked,” Du tells Sixth Tone.  Before entering a house, Du will ask its stranded owners to record a video holding their ID card and stating that they allow the volunteers to get in. After entering with the help of a locksmith or a hidden key, they are greeted by hungry but elated animals. In one video Du posted on social media, a pig locked in a closed balcony hadn’t eaten for a week. “The balcony is a mess, and he has even chewed on the water basin,” Du said. In another video, a cat was giving birth when Du arrived. Two of the kittens died, but the volunteers cleaned up and left enough food and water to last a fortnight, preventing a worse situation. “In the face of disaster, helping small animals is also what we humans should do,” Du says. Elsewhere in China, animals and their caretakers have also been put in a bind by the outbreak and the measures enacted to stop it. In cities throughout the country, businesses have been advised to stay shut following the weeklong Lunar New Year break, which would have ended on Jan. 30 but has been extended to Feb. 9 in many places.  Chen Junren owns a pet store in downtown Shanghai, and this week opened up anyway. With a decade of experience, he knows it should be a busy time of year. “Usually around this time, the store should be filled with owners taking their dogs over to buy food and give them baths, but now it’s so empty,” Chen tells Sixth Tone. He has turned to selling online, but is quickly running out of goods, especially imported brands. Chen thinks China’s pet market, which has rapidly grown and last year exceeded 200 billion yuan ($28.8 billion) for over 100 million cats and dogs, will be affected for at least a year. Chen is also facing a staffing shortage. “None of my employees have returned yet,” he says. Some of them celebrated Lunar New Year with their families in Hubei and cannot leave the province until the lockdown lifts. In any case, it might be a while before Chen gets help. Anyone arriving in Shanghai from elsewhere in China is asked to go into two weeks of self-quarantine. But Chen is not alone. A 7-month-old shiba inu was sent to stay in his store by its owner, who is stuck in Wuhan. “I will take care of the puppy for him no matter what,” Chen says. “Pets are more important now than ever because, without their company, life would be so much harder at this moment.”  Vet clinics have also largely been ordered to stay closed. Zhang Fan, a veterinarian in Wuhan, thinks such measures might be counterproductive and harmful to public health. “Some pet owners may take their pets to other cities for medical treatment, which will increase the possibility of unnecessary population flow,” he says. Many clinics have launched online consultations, though there are limits to what doctors can do from a distance. “But we will do our best to alleviate the difficulties and save the lives of as many pets as possible,” says Qin Kong, co-founder of Shanghai-based pet services company Petform. “Every life deserves respect.” They launched their online consultations on Jan. 30 and have already helped hundreds of customers.  For most pet owners, the biggest worry is whether they should still take their animals outside. Li Lanjuan, an epidemiologist and member of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television last month that people should “more strictly control their pets,” and that “if your pet runs around outside and comes in contact with an infected person, it will need to be monitored. This virus is transmitted between mammals, so we should take precautions for mammals.” Despite statements from both the World Health Organization and an expert at China’s National Health Commission refuting Li’s claim, suspicion toward pets has spread. In Weifang, eastern China’s Shandong province, and Taiyuan, a city in northern Shanxi province, districts have banned public dog-walking. In Wuxi, Jiangsu province, a neighborhood committee staff allegedly buried a cat alive after its owner was infected with the coronavirus, out of fear the feline could spread the disease. Fang Ling, the founder of a pet hotel in the mountains outside of southwestern Sichuan’s provincial capital Chengdu, tells Sixth Tone that Li’s comments created a wave of panic. “Every day, officials come to supervise and check whether we wear face masks, and how many times we disinfect and clean the place,” she says, adding she’s afraid she’ll be ordered to close any day. She’s taking care of some 35 dogs and has received new orders from people who’ve found it too difficult to keep walking their dogs in the city.  While most Chinese have stayed inside the past few weeks to limit the spread of the virus, Wang Yingchao, founder of WoWoDogWalk, a Shanghai-based dog-walking service, takes over 15,000 steps daily. “Staying indoors for a long time is painful for us, let alone some dog breeds who need more exercise,” says Wang. With her team, she walks dozens of dogs every day, fewer than usual. But there’s also a silver lining. “It’s actually less hassle to walk the dogs now, as you can hardly see people on the street,” says Wang.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005174
Four Charts That Help Explain How the Coronavirus Spread,"Wuhan officials stayed silent for weeks as millions traveled through the epicenter of the outbreak. By the time the alarm was raised, it was too late.",2020-02-07,"On Jan. 12, a longtime resident of Huanggang, a city in China’s central Hubei province, caught a train to Zhuhai, on China’s southern coast. She arrived the next morning with a nagging cough, but wrote it off as a cold. A week later, her symptoms worsened. She checked into a Zhuhai hospital on Jan. 19, and at 10 p.m. on Jan. 21, she finally got a diagnosis: the novel coronavirus. At that point, Huanggang had reported just 12 cases of the disease. Today that number stands at 1,897, making the city one of the hardest hit in an epidemic that as of Feb. 7 has already killed 637 and sickened 30,000 more on the Chinese mainland since it was first identified in Hubei provincial capital Wuhan last December. There were suggestions of human-to-human transmission from almost the very start of the outbreak. But as late as Jan. 19, Wuhan’s health authorities were still reassuring residents the risk was “relatively low.” It wasn’t until the next day, when Zhong Nanshan — a doctor renowned for his work during the 2003 SARS epidemic — declared the evidence for human transmission “definite,” that officials finally began to take it seriously. Two days later, they shut down all buses, trains, and planes in and out of the city. It was too late. An estimated 5 million Wuhan residents had already left the city ahead of the country’s weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. Most of them dispersed across the province, to cities like Huanggang or remote villages to celebrate with their families. Others went on vacation to places like Zhuhai or the eastern city of Wenzhou.  The novel coronavirus has an incubation period of up to 14 days, meaning those infected might not have even realized they were carrying the disease when they set out on their journeys. By the end of January, there were confirmed cases in every province-level region in the country. To get a clearer picture of how the virus spread, reporters at Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, analyzed the 763 novel coronavirus cases confirmed before Jan. 28 — a week after Zhong’s warning — for which detailed information is available. The results not only allow us to trace the path the virus took across the country, but also offer a powerful reminder of the importance of information transparency to a healthy society. Editor’s note: Differences in the amount of publicly available data for each region make it hard to draw comparisons across regional lines. On the night of Jan. 22, the Wuhan municipal government announced it was closing all airports, train stations, and other mass transit in and out of the city beginning from 10 a.m. the following day. The decision came just two days before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, a time when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel home or abroad, attend banquets, and convene with their loved ones. Of the 506 analyzed cases in which the patient’s full itinerary is known, 368 left Wuhan in the week before the quarantine. Of these, 86% did so prior to Jan. 21, when the authorities belatedly began warning of human-to-human transmission.  One carrier, a resident of northern Hebei province, arrived with his parents in Wuhan on Jan. 15. The three tourists left for the southeastern city of Xiamen three days later. Although the son began to experience symptoms on Jan. 19 — one day before Zhong Nanshan sounded the alarm — they continued their trip. He finally went to a hospital immediately after arriving in the southern megacity of Shenzhen on Jan. 22. Many of those who left Wuhan in the days leading up to the shutdown had similar experiences. Of the 506 known itineraries, at least 47 included multiple cities after leaving Wuhan. Another 28 never entered the city, instead contracting the disease while visiting other parts of the province. And a few never went to Hubei at all: They were infected after coming into contact with carriers elsewhere.  Of the 67 patients who passed through Wuhan on their journeys, 17 stayed only one day, and another four spent just hours in the city. There does not appear to be a connection between travelers’ length of stay in the city and the possibility of getting infected, greatly increasing the difficulty of identifying potential carriers.  “Everyone has been dissatisfied with our information transparency in this outbreak,” Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang told China’s state broadcaster in an interview on Jan. 27. The importance of timely, authoritative updates in an epidemic can be seen from the intervals between when patients first felt ill and when they sought treatment. In the early stages, a novel coronavirus infection can closely resemble a common cold, and many patients — and even some doctors — were unaware of the potential severity of the disease. One patient, a longtime Hubei resident from the northwestern Shaanxi province, first became symptomatic in late December but didn’t seek treatment from the local hospital until Jan. 21, after Zhong Nanshan’s announcement brought greater attention to the epidemic.  The broader data shows a split between those who started showing symptoms prior to Jan. 18 and those whose symptoms appeared after — with the former waiting much longer on average before seeking treatment. The contrast becomes even sharper on Jan. 22, when there was a noticeable jump in the number of patients seeking treatment the day their symptoms showed. What changed on Jan. 22? That was the day the Hubei provincial government finally declared a public health emergency. Within a week, every other province-level region on the Chinese mainland would follow suit.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005173
China Pushes TCM Therapy for Coronavirus Treatment,"Scientists are racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus, with an East-meets-West combination of medicines being the recommended course.",2020-02-07,"Health authorities in China are turning to millennia-old traditional medicines to treat the novel coronavirus that has so far killed more than 600 people and infected over 31,000 worldwide. The National Health Commission on Wednesday published its latest treatment plan for symptoms of the novel coronavirus, urging medical institutes to include traditional Chinese medicine in their formulas. There is no cure for the virus yet, but with a rising death toll and infection rate, authorities are pushing for a cocktail of TCM and Western medicines in hopes of saving more lives. According to the plan, there are certain traditional Chinese medicine therapies that can mitigate patients’ symptoms — including fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, and nausea — and that should be applied depending on the patient’s “state of illness, local climate characteristics, and physical condition.” Chinese patchouli, sun-dried tangerine peels, betel nuts, as well as the Peaceful Palace Bovine Bezoar Pill — a mixture of cattle gallstone, buffalo horn, and pearl and ruby sulfur, among other ingredients — are all prescribed under the plan. As TCM is being promoted to fight the novel coronavirus — as it was in 2003 during the SARS epidemic — supporters of the age-old practice believe the government’s push will give the long-debated field an opportunity to prove its worth. Meanwhile, skeptics doubt whether the 5,000-year-old custom can actually play an important role because of lacking scientific evidence and controversies over ingredients such as animal parts. Zhang Guojun, a professor at Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, told Sixth Tone that TCM emphasizes “treatment based on syndrome differentiation,” and its effectiveness varies from person to person. He says he believes the medicinal effects of TCM go beyond just fighting the coronavirus. “Traditional Chinese medicine plays a role in the entire clinical process, no matter if it’s for the diagnosis and treatment of common ailments or for severe problems,” Zhang said. Jiao Yahui, deputy director of medical administration and supervision at the National Health Commission, said Tuesday that traditional Chinese medicine has played “a very important role” in alleviating the symptoms of coronavirus patients. She added that it has also helped delay mild cases from developing into severe ones, which “can be verified by clinical data and cases.” However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence showing that the TCM ingredients work effectively on patients, and researchers have been racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. China said it would begin clinical trials on remdesivir from Feb. 3, after a paper in a renowned scientific journal said the experimental drug may have helped alleviate the symptoms of a patient in the United States. Doctors in Thailand have said that a mix of flu medicines and HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir were able to mitigate some of the more severe symptoms in some patients. China’s health authority has also said that the HIV drugs can be used on coronavirus patients. Meanwhile, the central government’s push to promote its national heritage means several local governments — including Shanghai, as well as Hubei, Guangdong, and Henan provinces — have turned to traditional Chinese medicine for coronavirus treatment. According to the official Xinhua News Agency, 23 patients in Hubei — the province with the highest number of deaths and infections — recovered following treatment with a combination of TCM and Western medicine. The Guizhou Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has gone a step further, soliciting suggestions from the public on “secret folk recipes” from TCM to help cure coronavirus infections, raising doubts over whether folk therapies could be clinically practical for treating the disease. Debates over the effectiveness of TCM were cast into the spotlight last week after two medical institutes suggested a traditional Chinese medicine syrup, Shuanghuanglian, could help “contain” the novel coronavirus. This led to a buying frenzy, and to influential state media outlets like People’s Daily, as well as medical experts, advising people not to fall for such claims during public health crises. Furthermore, after betel nut was listed among the ingredients in Wednesday’s treatment plan, experts debunked rumors that chewing the addictive stimulant could fend off the coronavirus. They also advised people to distinguish between betel nut for medical purposes and the carcinogenic snack that poses health risks. Zhang Boli, director of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and no relation to Zhang Guojun, said during a press conference Monday that TCM treatment “is not aimed at viruses, but more to regulate the body’s immune system.” “It is not advisable for everyone to take Chinese medicine for disease prevention,” Zhang said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005168
Gone But Not Soon Forgotten: Li Wenliang’s Online Legacy,One of the coronavirus whistleblower’s earliest posts on Weibo was an expression of solidarity for a journalist who suggested that officials’ negligence had contributed to a deadly train crash in 2011.,2020-02-07,"In the early hours of Friday morning, the novel coronavirus claimed the life of Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor authorities had punished just over a month ago for raising the alarm about a mysterious SARS-like respiratory disease spreading around the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Wuhan Central Hospital, where Li worked and had been receiving treatment, announced the doctor’s death on microblogging platform Weibo. “An all-out rescue failed,” the statement read. Initial media reports announced Li’s death at around 9:30 p.m. Thursday, though they were replaced hours later with new posts saying he was in critical condition receiving emergency treatment. Millions of sad, angry, and confused netizens stayed up late hoping for a miracle that never came, and the hospital’s eventual confirmation of Li’s death seemed to send a shockwave through the entire country. Li is believed to be one of eight whistleblowers the Wuhan police summoned and formally reprimanded in late December and early January for supposedly spreading rumors about a virus that bore striking similarities to SARS, also a coronavirus. In the days and weeks that followed, Li would reflect on the farcical experience in his Weibo posts, growing his follower count to 1.2 million by time of publication Friday. Hours after the doctor’s death, the National Supervisory Commission, China’s top anti-corruption agency, said it would send a team of officials to Wuhan to conduct a full investigation. To get to know the man before he became a martyr, Sixth Tone has reviewed Li’s Weibo posts, written in vivid and vigorous prose, from 2011 to about a week ago. The young doctor who studied in Wuhan and later made his home in the city had a penchant for posting photos of his daily meals and snacks. He posted about gifts he received from online lotteries, staying up late to watch snooker by livestreaming, and the latest gadgets he hoped to buy.  One of Li’s first posts on Weibo came after a collision of two high-speed trains near the eastern city of Wenzhou left 40 dead and over 170 injured in July 2011. Wang Qinglei, a journalist for state broadcaster China Central Television, had been suspended for raising questions about preexisting safety concerns during an interview after the incident — a punishment Li felt was unjust. “Wang Qinglei is a responsible and excellent journalist,” he wrote. “We should collect signatures and demand that he be reinstated!” Like most everyone else, Li would sometimes complain about work. He wrote that he felt frustrated because he couldn’t afford expensive imported fruit, and about how he forced himself to exercise to stay fit. Li’s warmth and humanity shine through in these posts, which show how he treasured his multiple roles as father, husband, and son. Li photographed food with all the enthusiasm but none of the skill of a high schooler hoping to spruce up his Instagram. Once, he posted a series of photos of Coca-Cola bottles with differently worded labels that amused him. One night in 2013, Li wrote that he suddenly had a craving for oranges; half an hour later, he posted again to say that he had left his home and was on a 1 kilometer adventure to find the citrusy goodness he so craved. In 2019, Li took to Weibo to compliment the chef at the Chinese fast-food chain Dicos who had made the scrumptious fried chicken he had ordered.  In a post on Nov. 27, 2019, Li half-joked, half-complained about Elevit, a multivitamin for pregnant women. “It’s so expensive!” he lamented. After Li’s death, some media outlets reported that his wife, who is pregnant, had left Wuhan with their first child and her parents. Earlier in November, Li had shared a post with photos of the Great Wall in the fall. “It’s so beautiful! I hope I can bring Li Junior there some day,” he wrote. Li rarely posted photos of his family on Weibo. His wife and son appear in just two pictures from November 2018. In the first, the boy is wrapped in a red blanket smiling wide at a toy in each hand, with Li’s caption reading “hand in hand.” The second photo shows the boy and his mother in the back of a car, the boy’s face turning away as if to escape the stern expression on his mother’s. “Ideological education is important,” Li quips in the post’s accompanying text.  On a few occasions, Li writes about arguments or tiffs between him and his wife. When smartphone maker Smartisan released its T2 handset, Li waited online for two hours to buy it — only to be thwarted, he claimed, by his wife at the last minute. “We had a cold war on our hands the whole night, and even canceled our parting kisses in the morning,” Li wrote. “You see, a man can’t live without a secret stash of dough!” In 2013, Li posted about a partial relaxation of the one-child policy that allowed couples in which one spouse was an only child to have an additional kid. Li was elated. “Holy crap! It’s now possible to have two!” he cheered. Once when Li was trying to lose some extra weight, he posted twice to complain about how his father seemed to be in better shape than he was. After Li’s parents visited him in 2012 when he was working in Xiamen, a coastal city in the eastern Fujian province, he posted about how he was sad to see them go. “Dad and Mom are leaving…” he wrote, attaching a photo of a high-speed train at a railway platform. As a doctor, Li closely followed the latest news and developments in China’s medical and health care industry. He harbored no illusions about his profession: Unlike in other countries, doctors in China work long hours for relatively low pay and social standing. In 2013, he shared a screenshot of a paper in British medical journal The Lancet titled, “Appeal from Chinese doctors to end violence,” after three doctors were killed and 10 medical staff were injured in a spate of seven attacks. Then in December of last year, Li shared an article about how Yang Wen, another doctor, was brutally killed by a patient’s relative in Beijing, causing a public outcry. One of the tougher times, according to Li’s Weibo page, was around Feb. 7, 2014. “I don’t want to work, I don’t want to work,” the young doctor wrote in successive posts. Five years later, he appeared to be out of the doldrums and intently focused on his calling. “Today is a busy day. With too many people to see, I inevitably felt myself becoming a bit impatient,” he wrote in October 2019. “Thanks to all my patients for their understanding.” While Li’s posts reveal a keen sense of humor, one of his jokes — about how the Mayan calendar supposedly predicted the end of the world on Dec. 21, 2012 — is now heavy with the weight of his death. “Dear friends, after today you may lose contact with me because I’m going to save the world,” Li wrote. “If you see the sun rise as usual on the 22nd, then it means I have succeeded. But don’t thank me for it — it’s merely my duty.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005172
A City on Red Alert: Shanghai Hunkers Down to Wait Out Epidemic,"The novel coronavirus has infected relatively few people in Shanghai so far, but the city’s residents are leaving nothing to chance.",2020-02-07,"SHANGHAI — For Qiqi, a security staff member at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, a passenger wearing a mask and sunglasses used to be a rare and intriguing sight. The person was likely a pop star, an online celebrity, or a plastic surgery patient, the 29-year-old would tell her colleagues. But things have changed dramatically in recent days: Nearly every traveler passing through Qiqi’s scanner now covers their face. “If they don’t have medical-issue eyewear, they’re wearing sunglasses or swimming goggles,” says Qiqi, who withheld her real name because she’s not authorized to speak to the media. “Everybody is fully armed.”  The mood in Shanghai has been calm but tense in recent days as local residents do everything they can to protect themselves from the outbreak of a novel coronavirus that has killed over 630 people in the Chinese mainland as of Feb. 7. The eastern Chinese city has so far remained relatively isolated from the epidemic — which started some 700 kilometers to the west in the city of Wuhan — with only one recorded death from the disease to date. But Shanghainese are leaving nothing to chance. The Shanghai government declared a level 1 emergency Jan. 24. It has since extended the Lunar New Year holiday, shut down major tourist attractions, canceled music concerts, and forced airports and train stations to check the temperatures of every passenger before entering. Two weeks later, the city’s streets are still remarkably quiet as residents hole up at home. Most bars, restaurants, and stores remain shuttered. Many office complexes have sealed their premises entirely, with companies ordering employees to work from home.  Most locals have fully embraced the safety precautions. Despite accounting for only 2% of China’s population, Shanghai users were responsible for one-quarter of face-mask purchases on e-commerce apps Taobao and Tmall Jan. 20, according to online data consultancy Shenmou. When lining up to collect face masks from distribution points, some residents have begun standing at 2-meter intervals, to minimize the risk of infection — a practice netizens have labeled “North European queuing.” Photos of the staggered lines bearing the tongue-in-cheek slogan, “in terms of fearing death, we’re absolutely No. 1 in the country” have been shared by thousands of Shanghainese on social media apps WeChat and Weibo in recent days. Inside the city’s housing complexes, community organizers are coordinating local efforts to contain the outbreak, which has infected 269 people in Shanghai as of Feb. 7, according to official data.  Dong Chaxian, chair of the residential committee at the Shuitangjie complex in north-central Putuo District, says the workload is even more intense than during the SARS epidemic of 2003. All seven Shuitangjie committee members are spending the entire day on virus-related tasks, according to Dong. Their duties include broadcasting health advice over public loudspeakers, putting up posters announcing new safety measures, and tracking the movements of the complex’s roughly 2,000 households — especially the 25 families who come from Hubei, the province at the center of the epidemic. The return of one family from Wuhan in late January triggered a frenzy of activity, Dong says. The 66-year-old received a call at midnight from an anxious resident informing her of the family’s arrival. “Come on, go check their situation!” she recalls the man saying. Dong knocked on the returnees’ door first thing the next morning, informing them they were required to stay inside their home for 14 days. She also ordered the returnees to sleep and eat in separate rooms, have their temperatures checked every day, and update Dong on their health condition on a daily basis.  A group of social workers, volunteers, and a community doctor come to the complex to conduct temperature checks twice a day. The quarantine policy, however, has proved difficult to enforce at times. Dong says she continually receives calls from residents complaining that their neighbors have left their apartments. “I know the things we can do are only trifles — we tell them to wash their hands, stay at home, and if they have a fever, report it to us immediately,” says Dong. “But communities are the small cells that make up society.” Shanghai’s schools have been ordered to remain closed until March, yet local principals tell Sixth Tone they’re also struggling to cope with coronavirus administration. Wang Qian, head of a downtown primary school who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy, says she’s required to keep track of nearly 2,500 students and dozens of staff members on a daily basis.  “We designed an online questionnaire for parents to report everywhere they’ve visited since Jan. 10 and whether they’ve had contact with any confirmed (coronavirus) cases,” says Wang. “We also require parents to report their children’s health condition every day.” Wang began stockpiling essential supplies as early as mid-January as concerns over the outbreak began to escalate, ordering 3,000 face masks and hundreds of bottles of hand soap and disinfectant. She’s starting to worry, however, that these preparations were inadequate. “We have to undertake a comprehensive cleaning and disinfection of the whole school before the new semester,” says Wang. “If the epidemic isn’t over by then, we’ll need more supplies.” With no end to the health crisis in sight, the principal says she’s already considering canceling plans for several events, including the student’s graduation ceremony in June.  At Pudong Airport, Qiqi is also concerned about shortages of essential supplies, particularly face masks. She is required to wear a mask at all times during her 24-hour shifts, and she prefers to change masks every four hours for hygienic reasons. But in recent days, she has only been given one new mask per shift. Passenger numbers at the airport are only around 30% of their usual levels, Qiqi estimates, as tourists scrap vacation plans and airlines cancel flights. Her work, however, has become more challenging due to the tense atmosphere. “Passengers are reluctant to take off their masks and sunglasses, and they don’t like it when we require them to open their suitcases,” says Qiqi. “They think it’ll increase the chances of them being infected.” The security guard says she canceled all her plans to see family members over the Lunar New Year holiday, and she stays at home as much as she can. Like many in the city, Qiqi is cooking most of her meals and relying on delivery companies to deliver her groceries, so she doesn’t have to shop at crowded supermarkets.  Grocery delivery companies have been the main beneficiaries from the outbreak, and delivery drivers on scooters can be seen constantly zooming between different housing complexes. Lei Zhiqiang, a 33 year-old driver for Alibaba-owned supermarket chain Hema, says he’s working from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, trying to keep up with the number of orders. “Most of the vegetables are sold out. And even if they’re not, we don’t have enough delivery people,” says Lei. “Normally, we have around 200 people to deliver orders, but because of the Spring Festival, there are only about 70 people working.”  The upside for Lei is that, because the streets are so quiet, he’s been delivering eight orders per hour in recent days, two more than usual. “I can drive as fast as I like,” says Lei. “Shanghainese are all staying home and are reluctant to go outside.” Lei, who is from the inland Henan province, tells Sixth Tone his customers are being extremely cautious during the epidemic. Most place large orders — enough to last several days — and tell Lei to leave the packages outside their doors, so they don’t have to interact with him directly. “They’re afraid of meeting and having contact with strangers, especially someone like me who has an accent,” he says. The driver, however, says he isn’t scared of the coronavirus. He’s happy for the extra work — and looks forward to receiving his bonus. “If you’re strong like me, you’ll never be infected and beaten by the virus,” says Lei.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005171
Chinese Students’ ‘Millions of Masks’ Drive Courts Controversy,"Donors are increasingly turning to grassroots relief efforts to fight the coronavirus, but such initiatives’ scant experience in the civil sector has worried volunteers and sparked questions about transparency.",2020-02-07,"A grassroots charity campaign for sending sorely needed medical supplies to China’s frontline medical workers as they battle the coronavirus has come under suspicion of mismanagement. The “millions of masks” campaign, launched by Chinese students at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio before spreading to other U.S. universities, aims to collect and send protective medical equipment to Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic that by Thursday morning had killed over 500 in China and infected over 28,000 people worldwide. Shortages of medical supplies have led to over 150 hospitals in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, appealing to the general public for emergency aid. Domestic media reported Wednesday that a hospital in Guangshui, a city some 150 kilometers north of Wuhan, had run out of medical supplies, with almost no goggles or face shields left. In a video that went viral last week, the campaign’s spokesperson, Liu Diqing, told domestic media outlet Pear Video that the campaign had acquired 3.4 million protective suits from Alabama in the U.S., and that these supplies could meet the demands of China’s frontline doctors for one month. After news of the purported donations spread on Chinese social media, some netizens began to question whether the protective suits met the necessary standards, or whether they had actually been delivered to Wuhan. Chinese people have good reason to be skeptical of charities, which have a less-than-sterling reputation in the country after several high-profile scandals in the last decade. Earlier this week, Hubei’s Red Cross Society was punished for negligence after distributing 3,000 face masks to a hospital for Wuhan’s coronavirus patients and 18,000 masks to non-frontline hospitals in the city. According to Liu, the message of the viral video was misleading due to “the media outlet’s editing and repurposing of content.” He said last week that the 3.4 million protective suits were actually synthetic coveralls, and that some of them had yet to be purchased. The same day, the campaign said that while the items may not be suitable for use in hospitals, they could still provide protection for nonmedical workers such as security guards and trash collectors. These assurances have done little to disperse netizens’ doubts, however, and volunteers who worked on the campaign have even begun to voice concerns about what they say is a lack of transparency. Wen Chenglong, one of the campaign’s volunteers, told Sixth Tone that he has heard hardly anything from the organizers about the donation drive’s progress. Wen, a former employee of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has volunteered with several charitable causes including “millions of masks” by helping to pair them with Alibaba’s logistics services to get their items into China and to their intended destinations. After representatives from the campaign approached him for help on Saturday, Wen began making plans to meet their tight deadline. But in the end, the campaigners didn’t go with any of the operators Wen procured for them, and he hasn’t heard from them since. “Where did the medical supplies go? Because we were involved in the work, we have a right to know their whereabouts,” said Wen, who feels worried that well-meaning but unprofessional initiatives could undermine China’s broader relief efforts. A student responsible for the “millions of masks” campaign’s media relations told Sixth Tone on Thursday that they will publish an article about their progress in one week, after all the medical supplies have been shipped to China. The student declined to comment further. Speaking to domestic media, another member of the campaign acknowledged that there had been unforeseen obstacles in procuring supplies and engaging with would-be donors. “When the truck runs fast, there’s a risk that it might flip over,” the volunteer said, using a metaphor to refer to the progress of the campaign. “But actually, we didn’t flip over — we’re just misunderstood.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005166
"After the Lockdown, Wuhanese Struggle to Return Home","On Jan. 23, the megacity at the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak sealed itself off from the rest of China. Two weeks later, thousands of residents are still stuck outside.",2020-02-06,"As Mei Ke boarded a flight out of the central Chinese city of Wuhan Jan. 14, she thought she was embarking on a regular Lunar New Year vacation. Over the past two weeks, however, the 21-year-old’s trip to southern China has taken a dramatic and unexpected turn. Within days of her arrival, Mei’s hometown was placed under lockdown as an outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus spread from the city across the country. The disease has killed 491 people and infected over 24,000 as of Feb. 5. The lockdown has left Mei and thousands of other Wuhan natives stranded in places where they are increasingly unwelcome, with locals viewing anyone from the city in Hubei province as a potential source of infection. Mei had never heard of the coronavirus when she left Wuhan with her brother and grandmother to visit her parents in Fangchenggang — a port city near China’s border with Vietnam, where the couple worked seasonal factory jobs.  A week previously, Chinese health authorities had announced a novel strain of the virus to be responsible for a spate of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, but said they considered the danger of an epidemic to be low. The day after Mei’s arrival in Fangchenggang, Wuhan’s health commission announced that though 41 people had been infected, it believed “the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low” — a miscalculation later proved wrong. But the situation changed dramatically as China ramped up preparations for the Lunar New Year, a weeklong holiday during which hundreds of millions of people travel across the country and abroad. On Jan. 23 — the day before the start of the holiday — all air and ground transportation was suspended in Wuhan, a city with a larger population than New York City. The travel restrictions left 9 million people inside Wuhan, while an estimated 5 million residents had already left. New coronavirus infections continued to emerge in regions across China, and many of these cases involved people who had recently traveled from Wuhan or other cities in Hubei province. On Jan. 27, a 50-year-old man from Beijing died from pneumonia caused by the virus just days after returning from a trip to Wuhan. The speed of the outbreak has spread fear in China, evoking painful memories of SARS — another strain of coronavirus that killed more than 300 on the Chinese mainland in 2002 and 2003. Whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome infected just over 5,000 Chinese over more than six months, Chinese authorities had confirmed a similar number of cases of the new virus within weeks.  Local governments in 31 Chinese provinces launched a level 1 emergency response, canceling public events and shutting schools, to prevent further infections. Fifteen additional cities in Hubei province followed Wuhan’s lead by imposing a full lockdown. Anyone from Hubei, or who had recently visited the province, rapidly became suspect — especially after reports emerged of people infected with coronavirus hiding their symptoms and denying having recently visited Hubei. In Fangchenggang, local officials began sending doctors to check the temperatures of everyone with a connection to Wuhan twice a day from Jan. 25. Mei and her relatives passed the tests, but their relief was short-lived. The following day, Mei received a message confirming that the family’s return flights to Wuhan had been canceled, as the city’s airport had been closed down. She has been unable to find alternative routes back to her hometown.  Shortly after, the hotel in which the family was staying ordered them to check out. No other local hotels would admit them, for fear they might be infected. Mei’s parents finally convinced their employer to let the family stay in a small, prefabricated cabin next to the factory. The cabin has no kitchen, so the family has no choice but to leave the cabin to find food.  These expeditions, however, have become increasingly difficult. On several occasions, the local restaurants have called the police after discovering Mei and her relatives are from Wuhan. “I feel like a fugitive,” says Mei. “We have to eat. But every time we drive our car outside, we’re scrutinized.” Fangchenggang residents tend to avoid the family in the streets, while some occasionally shout at them in the city’s local dialect, which the Wuhanese don’t understand. On one occasion, a colleague of Mei’s father explained that the locals were telling the family to “get out for the sake of everybody’s health.”  The family is trying to avoid unwanted attention by staying quiet in public. Yet Mei says the psychological pressure on the family is building, and both her and her mother have cried several times. “I understand the urgency to control the virus, and we have cooperated with the authorities,” says Mei. “But it’s unbearable, being cursed by the others.” Though some Wuhanese trapped in other cities have praised the treatment they have received, tensions have been rising in many regions as communities go to ever-greater lengths to isolate themselves from those who fled the center of the epidemic. In Henan, a region bordering Hubei province, villages have set up checkpoints and barricaded roads to keep out people returning from Wuhan. In a few cases, local officials have locked returnees inside their homes by fixing steel bars to their front doors. Many netizens have praised these “hardcore” measures, perceiving them as tough but necessary to contain the epidemic. Some Wuhanese, however, say fears over the virus have occasionally led people to overreact and take excessive action against them. Zhang Wen, a student at a university in Wuhan whose name has been changed to protect her identity, has been shocked by the harsh treatment she has received since returning to her hometown of Sanming in the southeastern Fujian province Jan. 18.  Five days after her arrival, a list containing the personal details of people returning from Wuhan to her hometown began circulating on social media app WeChat. The leaked document included Zhang’s name, national ID number, home address, and phone number. Zhang, who was quarantined at home at the request of the local health authorities, began receiving calls from relatives and people she didn’t know, telling her to stay inside and not infect others. Before long, Zhang also started hearing rumors, again spread through WeChat, that she was infected with the coronavirus. “I was furious,” Zhang tells Sixth Tone. “I was furious about those people circulating my personal details, ignoring my legal rights.” Zhang’s hometown is not the only city involved in mass leaks of Wuhan returnees’ personal information. Databases containing the details of thousands of people in several communities were shared on WeChat and other social media platforms before this year’s Lunar New Year holiday.  “Some people say extraordinary measures are necessary in extraordinary times. I don’t get it,” says Zhang. “Just because it’s a critical time, should our rights to privacy be sacrificed?” The cases prompted the state-run People’s Daily to publish an editorial Jan. 26 calling for an end to the leaks and unnecessary discrimination against people from Hubei. Four days later, the Ministry of Transport published a notice ordering transportation departments to safeguard personal information according to the law and prevent any such information leaks. As the epidemic progresses, many people from Hubei are focusing on finding ways to return to their hometowns. Ye Zhigang, who spoke to Sixth Tone under a pseudonym for privacy reasons, cut short his vacation to Tibet Jan. 29.  Since arriving in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Ye had been staying in a government-designated hotel, after other hotels refused to admit travelers from Hubei. By Jan. 29, however, Ye was receiving repeated calls from the hotel, asking when he planned to check out. Ye’s hometown of Jingzhou, a city bordering Wuhan, is under lockdown. But Ye decided to book a train that passed through Jingzhou, then beg the train driver to stop in the city. Though a rail customer service operator insisted that the train wouldn’t stop in Hubei over the phone, Ye had heard stories of several Hubei travelers returning home this way. Ye flew from Lhasa to Chongqing on the night of Jan. 31 and managed to catch four hours of sleep in a hostel after being turned away by several hotels. The next morning, he boarded his train home. It was the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, but there were only three people in Ye’s carriage as the train entered Hubei. As he stepped onto the platform at Jingzhou Station, he smelled disinfectant — and he knew he was finally home. “Even though the situation at home is worse, we just want to be with our families,” says Ye. Back in Fangchenggang, Mei and her family hope to make the 1,300-kilometer journey back to Wuhan by car. They have asked village officials to provide a permit allowing the family to pass through the highway checkpoints. The officials, however, have yet to respond to this request. The family is still waiting in the prefabricated cabin for further news. “All I want is to go back to Wuhan,” says Mei.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005156
"Under Quarantine, Huanggang Students Fret Over ‘Gaokao’","China’s leaders have called the coronavirus crisis a “major test,” but the high school seniors at the heart of the epidemic are preoccupied with a different sort of exam.",2020-02-06,"When 18-year-old Gan Jian heard last week that China’s Ministry of Education was pushing back the start of the spring semester amid the ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic, he was more worried than relieved. “I was a bit concerned about the gaokao (college entrance exam),” Gan says. “The epidemic will end. But for me, the gaokao is my priority. The clock is ticking, and we don’t have much time left.” Gan is a 12th grader at Xishui County Experimental Senior High School in the central city of Huanggang. Located 75 kilometers from the outbreak’s epicenter of Wuhan, Hubei’s provincial capital, Huanggang has the third highest number of recorded cases in the country and has been on virtual lockdown since Jan. 24, with schools and most businesses closed and residents urged to stay indoors and “self-quarantine.” But with the all-important gaokao just 122 days away, many students, parents, and teachers in the region worry that lost class time now could mean lost points on the exam. On Jan. 27, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, announced a nationwide extension of the Lunar New Year public holiday from Jan. 30 to Feb. 2. The same day, the education ministry empowered localities to extend the break further if needed. For most students in Huanggang, school remains canceled, but the city is one of a number around the country allowing schools to make special arrangements for students preparing to take the gaokao. Huang Tian, a 12th grader at Hubei Huanggang Secondary School, didn’t get to enjoy the two-day extension of the Lunar New Year holiday: Her school announced that classes for seniors would be held via livestream starting Jan. 30. “That’s when our spring term was originally scheduled to begin,” Huang says. “We didn’t really get a longer break. It’s too bad: I still had to finish my (vacation) assignments on time.”  Huang received a detailed daily schedule from her teacher a week ago. Her days start at 6:30 a.m., when her subject teachers post review materials to the class’s chat group on QQ, a popular messaging platform. At 8:35 a.m., the day’s lectures begin. Huang has four 90-minute classes each day, all of which she watches from her bedroom. After a scheduled 35-minute dinner break, she starts wan zixi, the nighttime review session, when she does her homework and takes practice tests until 10:30 p.m. “Given the epidemic, we’ve made disease control our priority,” says Gong Dansheng, an official with Huanggang’s board of education. “But taking into consideration the immense pressure 12th graders are under because of the gaokao, we’re letting them start (online) classes slightly earlier. Other grades are not scheduled to start (online) until next week.” The city’s decision to offer virtual classes is broadly in line with official policy. On Jan. 29, two days after authorizing an extension of the winter break, the Ministry of Education released a statement urging all schools to “suspend school but not learning” by hosting classes online. Wuhan, one of the only cities with more coronavirus cases than Huanggang, is also establishing virtual classrooms for seniors. As China deals with the widening epidemic, a number of prominent digital education platforms have offered their services to schools that are unable to open regularly. In the coming weeks, as many as 5 million students at all levels of education are expected to attend livestreamed classes via Alibaba’s free DingTalk conference call service, according to state media reports. Other schools including Gan’s are using online courses designed by education companies. The sudden switch to virtual classrooms and distance learning hasn’t been entirely smooth. Li Xingchen, a 12th grader at Huanggang Secondary School, doesn’t have a broadband connection at home. In order to watch his school’s online lectures, he has to use around 2 gigabytes of mobile data every day. “It’s affordable so far, but I can imagine it being a problem for someone else,” Li says. “For me, the biggest issue is all the time I spend staring at my phone screen. I feel like I’m almost blind by the end of the day.” The ongoing citywide lockdown also poses challenges. “I’m about to run out of pens and paper,” Huang says. “And there’s nowhere to get more because most stores are closed.” Students aren’t the only ones struggling to adjust. Guo Xu, a math teacher at Huanggang Secondary School, says widespread travel restrictions in the province have stranded many teachers in their rural hometowns. “They don’t have access to adequate equipment for livestreaming,” Guo says. “So the few of us who remain in the city have to teach all the students.” There are nearly a thousand 12th graders at Guo’s school, he says, and only about two teachers for each subject. Other teachers worry that having students attend class from home is ineffective. “We have to rely on parents and homeroom teachers to supervise students and make sure they upload their homework on time,” says Yang Fan, a 12th grade Chinese teacher and the dean of pedagogy at Tuanfeng Secondary School in Huanggang. Yang’s school isn’t planning on livestreaming classes because many students and teachers lack the necessary equipment. They’ve been using pre-designed resources from an online education platform instead. Yang’s school is also telling students to be mindful of their health. “We remind our students all the time to take precautions against the novel coronavirus,” Yang says. The school asks all students to report their health status every morning. According to Yang, none of the students or staff have contracted the virus. “For most students, the gaokao is a bigger source of anxiety,” Yang says. “They’re still kids.” “I’m a bit nervous,” says 12th grader Gan. “I’m still not very used to online classes, and some of my study plans have been disrupted by the epidemic. I need to catch up as soon as possible.” Other students have more practical concerns about the online course model. “I prefer having classes in an actual classroom to what we’re doing now,” Huang says. “Sometimes my teachers’ internet connection is spotty, and we can’t really hear them. There’s also no bell to remind teachers when class ends, so they just drone on and on.” “I hope they can contain the epidemic quickly so we can go back to school,” Huang says.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005164
China’s Entertainment Sector Suffers Amid Coronavirus Epidemic,"Delayed release dates and stalled projects are likely to hurt the country’s TV and film industry like never before, insiders say.",2020-02-06,"China’s television and film industry is facing a harsh winter, as several high-profile projects have postponed their releases amid the novel coronavirus crisis that has disrupted normal business operations by keeping millions of people indoors. Two Chinese films, “The Enigma of Arrival” and “Wild Grass,” have indefinitely delayed their scheduled Feb. 14 premieres. Nearly a dozen other movies slated for release on Valentine’s Day — a plum premiere for many studios — are also expected to announce later releases. Apart from domestic movies, several foreign films were scheduled to be released this month, including the critically acclaimed “Marriage Story” as well as “Sonic the Hedgehog,” according to American entertainment outlet Variety. Other Hollywood productions such as “Jojo Rabbit,” “Little Women,” and “1917” had already announced delays for their China releases. Though there are no official figures, some media estimates suggest that China’s box office is likely to suffer 13 billion yuan ($1.86 billion) in losses in February alone. The announcements come as more cities across the country are taking precautionary measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus that had killed more than 500 people and infected over 28,000 others globally as of Thursday morning. People have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, mass gatherings, and crowds. The coronavirus outbreak has unexpectedly impacted China’s entire TV and film industry, said Lü Jianmin, a film producer and founder of the Beijing-based production company Chunqiu Time Film Co. Ltd. “This is a situation that we have never experienced before,” he told Sixth Tone. Lü’s company, known for the hit “Wolf Warrior” franchise, planned to kick off production of two films after the Lunar New Year holiday, but those projects have been delayed. “Various categories of the film and television industry such as production, film promotions, and post-production have taken an unprecedented hit,” Lü said. “The industry was already facing a cold winter. There were just starting to be signs of recovery, but a more violent shock has arrived. The industry’s prospects are indeed not optimistic.” Last month, all seven Chinese films, including two animated features, delayed their debuts during the Lunar New Year holiday, a prime time for movies to rake in big bucks at the box office. Earlier this month, the China Federation of Radio and TV Associations issued a notice suspending all shoots, bringing more pressure and uncertainty to companies that were already in the middle of projects. Even before the epidemic started, the industry was facing a slowdown. In 2019, there were 27% fewer TV dramas filmed in China than in the previous year, and 1,884 Chinese film companies went out of business. “A sudden epidemic is tantamount to a ‘second frost,’” Lü said. “Everyone depending on this industry to make a living is now facing leaner times.” Guo Linyuan, vice general manager of a Beijing-based TV and film production company, said the company had greenlit a period drama before the holidays, with shooting scheduled to start in May or June. But the nature of film industry jobs doesn’t allow Guo and her peers to do much of their work remotely — the way many businesses are currently coping with the epidemic. “Now, our project has to be delayed indefinitely, and is contingent upon changes in the epidemic situation,” Guo said, adding that “everyone is still confident and waiting for the epidemic to be controlled in order to resume work and recover (from the slowdown).” For Shanghai Project Banana Filming Co. Ltd., the impact will not be felt as sorely in the short run, the company’s executive president, Wei Xiangdong, told Sixth Tone. The company’s recent film “Sheep Without a Shepherd” premiered in December, and the company is in the early preparatory stages for other projects. But Wei said he sees greater uncertainty in the long run, especially when it comes to booking actors and securing funds from investors. The halt in production also means there might be a period devoid of new creative content, should the epidemic drag on for months. “That would be the knock-on effect,” he said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005163
Life on the Coronavirus Front Line for Wuhan’s Doctors,"Overwork, stress, and the constant risk of infection have taken their toll on physicians at the center of the epidemic, but many are hopeful that the situation is starting to stabilize.",2020-02-05,"Since early January, Hu Sheng has been at the heart of the battle against the new coronavirus infecting thousands in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. In recent days, however, the 39-year-old doctor has been focusing on just one patient: himself. Hu is one of dozens of physicians in Wuhan who have been infected with the virus they are trying to contain, as medical staff struggle to protect themselves and their families while dealing with an ever-growing number of patients. More than 3,000 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located, on Tuesday alone. The respiratory disease specialist’s first encounter with the outbreak came Jan. 8. His employer, the Third People’s Hospital of Hubei Province, reassigned Hu to the outpatient department, to help his colleagues deal with a sudden surge in fever and pneumonia cases. The hospital is located just 7 kilometers from the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the first coronavirus cases reportedly emerged in December, and the number of patients was almost overwhelming.  Doctors in the outpatient department were working 24-hour shifts and dealing with up to 100 patients each day, whereas normally they would see fewer than 50, according to Hu. Around 60% of the patients had pneumonia, he estimates.  The physician took all the usual protective measures, wearing a mask at all times while seeing patients. Yet after two weeks, he began to feel fatigued and developed a cough. At first, Hu thought his intense workload was simply taking a toll on his health. But he decided to go for a CT scan anyway. Fifteen medical workers had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus Jan. 21, and health experts had confirmed the disease was definitely capable of human-to-human transmission. “I have a 3-year-old child and my parents are elderly. I had to be cautious, because I’d been working in an extremely dangerous environment,” Hu tells Sixth Tone. Hu took the scan Jan. 24. That evening, he was due to meet his family for a traditional Lunar New Year’s Eve dinner. But he canceled his plans as soon as he saw the results. The doctor had double pneumonia. After seeing dozens of patients with the same symptoms over the previous days, Hu knew that could only mean one thing: He was infected with the coronavirus. “When I tried to figure out how I got infected, I realized the most likely reason was that I didn’t wear any protective goggles,” says Hu. In late January, as more doctors became sick, Wuhan’s hospitals ramped up protection measures, and medical staff began wearing hazmat-style protective uniforms, masks, goggles, and face shields. The fear of infection, however, has weighed on junior doctor Ye Liwen’s mind. She was transferred to the fever clinic at the Third People’s Hospital Jan. 4.  The 27-year-old, who only began practicing medicine six months ago, tells Sixth Tone she didn’t tell her parents what she would be doing in her new position. “I didn’t want to worry them too much,” she says. Within days, Ye began experiencing chest distress and underwent a CT scan. Fortunately, the results showed no signs of infection “It (the distress) might have been caused by anxiety,” says Ye. “Who wouldn’t feel nervous working in such a distressing environment, receiving so many fever patients and seeing your colleagues go down?” Ye’s supervisor, a more senior doctor, was diagnosed with the virus the same day she received the all-clear. At least two other doctors and several nurses on her team have also been infected, she says. According to Ye, it’s difficult to estimate what proportion of the staff has contracted the virus. Her team has around five physicians on duty at a time, but the personnel are constantly changing as doctors recuperate from illness and long shifts. But anxiety in the wards is starting to dissipate as staff members who had contracted the virus early on recover and return to work, Ye says. “From feeling a lot of panic at the beginning, I think the general atmosphere at the fever clinic is calming down,” says Ye. “We understand more and more about the virus … (and) this gives us a sense of security.” Hu says he’s also feeling much better after over a week’s rest at home. “I’ve regained most of my vitality,” he tells Sixth Tone Sunday. “I’m exercising a bit more each day to prepare myself for when I go back to work.”  Some doctors in Wuhan, however, still worry about the safety of their family members, fearing they may unwittingly infect them with the virus. Though most healthy adults have only experienced minor symptoms after contracting the new coronavirus, other groups are at greater risk — especially elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions. (Of the 400-plus deaths reported so far, 80% were patients over 60 and over 75% already had more than one chronic disease, the National Health Commission said Tuesday). Hu has been living apart from his wife and child since being reassigned to the outpatient department, and his family remains healthy. But his wife, a doctor at a community hospital, is still working on the frontline, dealing with fever patients on a daily basis. “She still lives with our young child,” says Hu. “I’ve repeatedly told her to pay attention to every detail of protection at work, but I’m still deeply concerned about their health.” Diagnosing new coronavirus cases remains challenging in Wuhan, and this is increasing the risk that patients will infect loved ones without realizing it, experts have warned. Many pneumonia patients have complained about shortages of coronavirus test kits. Meanwhile, Zhang Xiaochun — a leading respiratory disease specialist at Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital — has questioned the accuracy of the test kits and called for hospitals to rely on CT scans as the main method for diagnosing new infections. “We have seen more infections happening at family gatherings in Wuhan, and many patients didn’t show clear symptoms at the beginning,” Zhang wrote in a post on social media app WeChat. “Their diagnostic test results came back negative in the early stages.” Zhang worries that hospitals’ current policy of telling patients with mild symptoms to stay at home for observation is worsening the epidemic. The early-stage patients are more likely to infect family members, as well as other people at the hospital when they come to take tests or collect prescriptions. “We have to immediately quarantine people in hotels or schools if their CT scans show typical signs of infection,” says Zhang. “We should get volunteers to help give them medicine.” For Hu, the fear that has spread throughout Wuhan is also exacerbating the situation. People are rushing to the hospital as soon as they develop a fever, and this is straining the city’s health system and increasing the number of infections. “If you develop a fever in the morning and visit a doctor in the afternoon, there’s no way a blood test can determine your real health condition,” says Hu. “If you visit a fever clinic, there’s a risk of cross-infection. You might contract coronavirus by making a non-essential hospital visit.” Though the Third People’s Hospital is being patient and ensuring infected doctors are fully recovered before returning to frontline duty, Hu says he is keen to get back to work as soon as possible. He is urgently needed.  The hospital has quadrupled the number of beds in the inpatient department for respiratory disease patients and closed down several smaller departments — including ear, nose, and throat, as well as ophthalmology — reassigning staff to concentrate on treating people with fevers and pneumonia. “Some of the beds are designated for medical workers who got infected and are in a relatively severe condition,” says Hu. “But most medical staff suffer only mild symptoms, like the majority of patients I have seen.” Few of the recently reassigned physicians are respiratory disease specialists, and doctors with Hu’s expertise are therefore needed more than ever. Hu hopes to be back on the ward within days. He has been taking two anti-viral drugs, umifenovir and oseltamivir, as well as the antibiotic moxifloxacin. On Monday, the doctor underwent a CT scan that suggests he has effectively recovered.  “I’ll be given further tests for coronavirus,” says Hu. “If two separate results in three days come back negative, I’ll be considered recovered and can get back to work.” Though there are few signs so far that the epidemic is slowing down, doctors tell Sixth Tone they’re hopeful most patients with non-severe symptoms can make an equally smooth recovery. Ye hasn’t witnessed a decline in the volume of patients visiting her department each day, but in recent days more of her consultations have been with existing patients coming for checkups, rather than new cases. “As we see more people recovering, we’re growing more confident that most people with mild infections can fully recover,” says Ye. Hu expects to see a greater number of patients declared healthy again in the coming weeks and says he’s confident most patients with mild symptoms will make a full recovery with the recommended medication. “The health authority has set a very high threshold for defining a recovery case: two negative coronavirus tests in a row over at least three days and apparent recovery shown on CT images,” says Hu. “That’s why the number of recovered patients has increased very slowly. Even for those with mild symptoms, the process takes two to three weeks.” In a press conference Monday, Qiu Haibo, a health expert working with the National Health Commission, said coronavirus patients in the recovery stage and those discharged from the hospital are no longer infectious and won’t be at risk of contracting the virus again for at least half a year. Hu cautions, however, that Wuhan’s medical workers should continue taking maximum measures to protect themselves — even those, like himself, who have already contracted the disease. “We’re still in the outbreak period of the epidemic,” says Hu. “We have to take every step cautiously.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005161
Coronavirus Reactions and the Politics of Xenophobia,"As an Italian in Nanjing, I’ve spent much of the past few days debunking wild and often racist rumors sent to me by friends around the world. Where is it all coming from?",2020-02-05,"“Now what do I do?” The question kept echoing in my head last Friday. Checking my messages after waking up, I could scarcely believe what I saw. While I’d been getting a few hours of sleep, Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s prime minister, announced my country was suspending all flights to and from China — an attempt, he said, to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed at least 492 people and infected another 24,000 worldwide as of Wednesday morning. I didn’t know how to react. Just before Conte announced the move at a press conference, I’d bought a ticket to go back to Italy. I teach art theory at a university in the eastern city of Nanjing, but after the school announced it was indefinitely delaying the start of the spring semester, I agreed to my mother’s request to spend some time with my family in Massa, a small city in northern Tuscany. But looking at the news, I had no clue whether that was even possible anymore. I tried to contact the travel agency through which I’d booked my tickets, only to learn I was customer number 1,301 in the queue. No one at the air carrier’s customer service picked up. I started to call anyone I could think of, but nobody — including people I know who work for the Italian government — could give me a clear answer on what to do. Conte’s announcement came just one day after World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the virus an international public health emergency, while also explicitly stating there was no need for measures that would “unnecessarily interfere with” travel and trade. Although my mother insisted that I should nonetheless try to make it back, my gut told me things wouldn’t work out. So I opted against boarding my plane to Beijing, where I was scheduled to catch my connecting flight to Italy. It turns out I’d made the right decision. Shortly before the plane was set to depart, a text message informed me that the second leg, from Beijing to Milan, had been canceled. On the positive side, I dodged the worst-case scenario: being stranded at 2 a.m., 1,000 kilometers from my home in Nanjing. To be clear, my original decision to fly back to Italy was not motivated by fear. Over the last few days, I’ve received dozens of messages from friends all over the world asking me how I was doing. People everywhere are talking about the current situation in China in post-apocalyptic terms: dead bodies in the streets, food shortages, and martial law. At least where I am in Nanjing, I have seen nothing of the sort. It’s certainly a moment of crisis. People are getting sick and dying. And even those not sick have had their lives altered by the radical measures the Chinese authorities have implemented in order to contain the coronavirus’ spread. Still, without forgetting the risks posed by the epidemic or ignoring the unfolding human tragedy, the vast majority of Chinese are not in imminent danger of death or starvation. And yet, like most non-Chinese residing in China that I know, I now spend much of my day answering panicked questions and debunking obvious falsehoods sent to me by frightened relatives and friends. Nerves are running high enough that a conspiracy theory about the virus being a bioweapon — for which there is no evidence — seemed plausible to many of my acquaintances. What’s behind all this fear? The answer to this question is certainly complex, but in this case I can think of two main factors. First, there’s the global rise of clickbait, fake news, and misleading information. Even academica isn’t immune. Take for instance a widely shared academic article that suggested the virus’ makeup was “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.” In other words, this preprint — that is, an article that hadn’t gone through the standard peer-review procedure — hinted that the virus had possibly been engineered. Vocal criticism from the scientific community led to the paper’s quick withdrawal, but not before it contributed to narratives like the above-mentioned bioweapon conspiracy theory. The second reason is perhaps even more alarming: the triumph of politics over reason. In times of crisis, it’s important to listen to neutral experts over ideologues. The WHO cautioned against suspending travel or trade, but some governments, including Italy’s, seem willing to disregard expert opinion in favor of catering to domestic politics. Conte’s rushed decision was likely just a desperate stunt to shore up support from the country’s right-wing populist Northern League Party and its powerful leader Matteo Salvini. Regardless of how you view Conte’s actions — or those taken by other governments — one thing is certain: These politicians’ rhetoric is often grounded in sinophobic or xenophobic sentiment. Too much of the discourse surrounding the current crisis has been influenced by, or plays into, the kind of outdated narratives scholar Jeff Bass explores in his work on epidemics and imperialism. The Western world, Bass argues, often depicts itself as a civilizing force, justifying its imperialistic tendencies by the need to control and quarantine the chaos of the so-called Third World. A widely shared video of a Chinese woman eating bat soup offers a perfect example of what Bass was talking about. Many commenters saw the video as proof that Chinese culture is filthy, thus justifying their impulse toward segregation and containment of the country’s people. Yet the three-year-old video, which features Wang Mengyun, the host of an online travel show, wasn’t filmed in China, but at a restaurant in Palau, an island in the western Pacific. It’s worth noting that the origins of the current outbreak remain unclear. Any connection between the novel coronavirus and the wet market in Wuhan where some of the first cases were identified — and where bats are not even part of the local cuisine — is still highly speculative. But more to the point: Wasn’t Wang simply following in the footsteps of Anthony Bourdain? The celebrity chef built his reputation on his adventurous “I’ll eat anything” attitude, for which he was praised as an ambassador of open-mindedness. It’s easy to see how reactions and policies differ when epidemics occur in Western countries. In April 2009, for example, the H1N1 “swine flu” virus killed thousands of people in the United States and Mexico without generating the sort of racially tinged narratives we see today. I do not mean to say we should let down our guards against this deadly disease. But we cannot dress up racism in the guise of scientific or medical concern, either.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005158
Remote Control: Coronavirus Has Millions in China Working From Home,"With conference call services overloaded by unprecedented traffic and people having to think outside the box to devise home office setups, China’s first-ever remote working experiment is off to a rocky start.",2020-02-05,"For many in China, Monday morning brought with it a surreal first-time experience: working from home. Millions of people in the country began working from home this week as both companies and local governments aimed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus that had infected over 24,000 people nationwide as of Wednesday morning, killing nearly 500 of them. From Monday, many large companies — including Tencent, JD.com, Suning, and Huawei, among others — have encouraged their employees to work from home for at least the next two weeks. Some cities and provinces including Shanghai have taken similar measures, mandating compulsory home quarantine periods during which people are expected to work remotely. The first day of these trials did not get off to the smoothest start. On Monday morning, video conference call providers such as Tencent’s WeChat Work, Alibaba-owned DingTalk, and U.S. firm Zoom were overwhelmed by surges in traffic, with many users complaining of lag and interruptions. Netizens joked that the companies had experienced their own “Double 11” — China’s biggest online shopping bonanza on Nov. 11 each year, when e-commerce sites’ servers are occasionally crushed by the figurative weight of millions of deal-seekers. Looking to avoid this problem, at least one company opted to use a group chat service marketed toward gamers to host its conference calls. DingTalk, which serves over 10 million companies in China and supports video calls with up to 302 people, announced Monday evening that it had experienced an all-time high in web traffic that morning, and had allocated 12,000 additional servers to increase its capacity. The same day, Zoom’s share price shot up 15%, the company’s biggest increase in eight months. On Tuesday, DingTalk said it had hastily added a beautifying camera filter to its video conference call app in response to sudden demand from users. Meanwhile, netizens — many of whom traveled to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday and have not yet returned to the cities they live and work in because of the coronavirus — are sharing their first-ever remote working successes and mishaps, as well as pictures of their less-than-ideal office setups — such as using a cupboard, washing machine, or workout bench as their desk, working in bed, or being interrupted by inquisitive pets.  Media outlets have also chimed in, sharing tips on working efficiently at home (pretend it’s a normal workday) and video conference call etiquette (change out of pajamas, avoid sending the wrong message by video-calling colleagues from bed, and apply basic makeup). Managers have come up with some innovative solutions to ensure that their employees are being productive. One worker told the online outlet Tencent Technology that their company enforced its regular 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. work schedule by requiring employees to send their geotagged location and photos of themselves in front of their computers three times a day, plus daily health updates. But creative work solutions have also led to some serious mistakes. On Monday, an employee at internet company Sougou accidentally sent a message to the app’s users warning that a city in the northern Hebei province was about to be hit by a 12.0 magnitude earthquake — the strongest ever recorded, had it not been completely fabricated. Sougou later apologized, removed its opt-in earthquake alert function, and attributed the error to an employee working remotely. Also on Monday, financial news outlet Eastmoney published a report that suggested the coronavirus epidemic could permanently transform the way Chinese industries operate by ushering in a prolonged era of remote work — and recommending that investors keep cloud-based work-from-home products and services on their radars. With most Chinese schools closed until at least early March, classrooms have been moved online, too. As of Monday, education bureaus in 20 provincial-level administrative regions had signed up with DingTalk’s “homeschooling” plan, which currently accommodates 20,000 schools and over 12 million students. Meanwhile, foreign teachers in Shanghai say they’ve been instructed to prepare content for online lessons. Some students are less than thrilled by technology being channeled to put an end to their extended Lunar New Year breaks. On Monday, students review-bombed DingTalk and Enterprise WeChat as revenge for indirectly putting them back to work. “DingTalk, I love you,” read a tongue-in-cheek one-star review of the app. “You allowed me to see my long-forsaken teacher earlier than anticipated.” “I’m so annoyed — were you really so bored that you had to eat bats?” read another one-star review, referring to the prevailing theory that the novel coronavirus came from human contact with the flying mammals. “Thanks a lot, you bat-eating bastard.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005160
China’s Students Battle Coronavirus From Behind Their Keyboards,"University students are coordinating online to solicit donations for hospitals needing medical equipment, fact-check what’s being reported about the epidemic, and relay first-person accounts from frontline cities.",2020-02-04,"On Monday morning, a group of students from Wuhan University’s school of computer science and engineering launched an online platform for connecting would-be donors with over 800 hospitals across China that are strapped for medical supplies. The efficiency of the initiative is almost as impressive as its altruistic spirit: The group of 40 students and programmers needed just 40 hours to bring their project to life, and coordinated everything entirely online. Their platform, Luoying Shanlian, lists people who have signed up as donors, along with the partner hospitals’ contact information and details of the equipment they need. The idea for the project came to Cui Xiaohui, a professor at Wuhan University’s Big Data and Cloud Computing Lab, after he and his students realized how badly hospitals — and especially those in the countryside — needed certain medical supplies. Though the students also want to develop online platforms to serve their local communities, they decided their first project should prioritize frontline medical workers, Cui told Sixth Tone.  Cui and his students may be hoping to do even better than at least one well-established charity. On Tuesday, the discipline inspection commission of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, dismissed the deputy head of Hubei’s Red Cross Society for “misconduct” after the group reportedly distributed 3,000 protective masks to a frontline hospital and 18,000 masks to hospitals not treating coronavirus patients, and then offered an unconvincing explanation as to why. “Many hospitals have urgent demand for supplies, but they don’t know who to turn to; at the same time, many would-be donors don’t know where to donate, and are just making inquiries through friends or on social media,” Cui said. “So I thought that if we could create a public platform that connects all of these hospitals and donors, people would be able to easily see the hospitals’ needs.” The project team consists of 40 people — half graduate students, half local programmers — as well as nearly 300 volunteers who help verify the information registered on the platform by both hospitals and prospective donors. But because most of Cui’s students are housebound, effectively quarantined, all of their collaboration takes place online. Yet the students and volunteers have still managed to work efficiently, dividing themselves into different groups tasked with customer service, system development, system maintenance, materials collection, and information screening. In the first 24 hours after Luoying Shanlian’s launch, the site received 150,000 visits, according to Cui. Students at the epicenter of the epidemic aren’t the only ones taking action. At Nanjing University some 500 kilometers away, Zheng Jiawen, a researcher at the School of Journalism and Communication, and the students she mentors have focused their well-known campus media platform, NJU FactCheck, squarely on the coronavirus epidemic and the misinformation surrounding it. Founded in October 2017, NJU FactCheck has a reputation for debunking online rumors and rebutting inaccurate or misleading claims made by public figures. In the past month, it has published two in-depth reports about the coronavirus crisis. The first compared the current epidemic to that of the SARS in 2002-2003, focusing on how the official responses have dovetailed or diverged, and the role played by media outlets; the second analyzed the updates Wuhan’s health department issued between Dec. 31 and Jan. 24, and identified a number of inconsistencies in the official narrative. At a time when most Chinese media outlets are focused on reporting from Hubei and other frontline areas, platforms like NJU FactCheck offer valuable analysis and context to reporters in the field — including some from the same university. Since Jan. 25, Nanjing University-affiliated public accounts on social app WeChat have been publishing a series of gripping first-person accounts by students from Hubei province who went home for the Spring Festival holiday and found themselves in the thick of the battle to contain the coronavirus. The series was organized by six faculty members from the university’s journalism school, who assembled a crack student reporting team as news of the epidemic began to break. On social media, the teachers recruited students from Hubei to record scenes from their daily lives at the heart of the outbreak. Around 30 students signed up, and have been sending a steady stream of reports back to the faculty-led editing department, which selects the best pieces for publication. By Tuesday, the team had published 11 articles in the series, each depicting a different reality on the front lines — from large cities like Wuhan and Yichang to lesser-known areas like Huanggang, Honghu, Xiantao, and Yangxin County. “The reason we initiated this reporting is because we want our students to know that they’re present in this life — they cannot detach themselves from it,” Zhou Haiyan, one of the six faculty working on the project, told Sixth Tone. “The things they see will become the basis for their future thoughts and actions.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005157
Dispatches From Hubei: New Year’s in the Countryside,"As China confronts a deadly coronavirus outbreak, rural areas near the epicenter are hunkering down for a long fight.",2020-02-03,"On the night of Jan. 13, 2020, I left Shanghai and returned to central China’s Hubei province to spend the Lunar New Year holiday with my family. After reaching the provincial capital of Wuhan, I caught a two-hour bus back to my village in the nearby municipality of Xiaogan. I remember thinking that the orange groves near my house resembled a sea of lanterns, stretching far off into the distance. That first week’s weather was cold, and my family and I spent it huddled indoors, only occasionally going out to stand by our door and chat with the neighbors or passing villagers. In other words, it was a perfectly ordinary January. Then, on Jan. 22, the Wuhan municipal government abruptly announced it was shutting down all public transit in and out of the city, effective from 10 a.m. the next day. Within a week, 14 other cities across the province followed suit as officials belatedly rushed to contain a viral outbreak that had already spread out of Wuhan to almost every region of the country. As of 3:50 p.m. on Feb. 3, China’s health authorities have confirmed 17,218 cases of the novel coronavirus, a cousin of SARS that causes pneumonia-like symptoms; 361 have died. Much of the public’s attention has been concentrated on Wuhan, where the outbreak originated last December, but a number of nearby satellite cities have also been devastated. Huanggang, a small city 75 kilometers from Wuhan, has the second most confirmed cases in the country at 1,246; Xiaogan is next, with a reported 918 cases. Villagers here were slow to wake up to the danger. Many of the 200 people in my village continued going about their lives and preparing for their Lunar New Year gatherings, even after Wuhan announced it was severing transit links on Jan. 22. Most had heard of the so-called Wuhan Disease, but out of habit they trusted that local officials were fully capable of handling the outbreak. Yet as I read up on the situation in Wuhan, I began to feel a sense of dread. More disturbing news began coming out of the city around Jan. 21. One of my relatives, who had been admitted to a hospital in that city for a bone fracture, was ordered out after just two days. His doctors said the hospital was being emptied but didn’t explain why. Over the next few days, the epidemic bubbled just beneath the surface of village life. Residents started sharing videos of Wuhan hospitals calling for aid, fever patients lined up out the door, and doctors on the brink. But they didn’t seem fully aware that they, too, were at risk. A few younger villagers and I tried to get our relatives to stay home, but without much success. The local farmer’s markets remained packed. The atmosphere intensified Jan. 23, after the news of Wuhan’s lockdown broke, but even then, few villagers believed they were in any personal danger. When I sent a message about the coronavirus outbreak to a group chat populated by friends and family, I was scolded by a relative. “Oh, cut it out,” he complained. “It’s the New Year and you’re making everyone uncomfortable.” I understood. Given the circumstances, denial was a normal response.  That night, however, a widely shared video brought the villagers’ worst fears to life. In it, a man is taken away by doctors to be quarantined as the middle-aged woman by his side starts to wail. “Help me!” she cries. “I have a fever too! I have a fever too!” Everyone instantly recognized her accent. Once they saw a fellow Xiaogan local being affected, they began to fear for themselves. Village chat groups were suddenly flooded with details about the outbreak. “It’s too scary out there,” another relative of mine wrote after cancelling plans to help host a banquet. “I’m not going out, even to make (the customary) New Year’s visits.” Of course, not everyone’s minds were so easily changed. While some social media-savvy residents spent the next few days sharing increasingly worrisome updates, videos, and photos from the crisis, others who were less plugged in hardly altered their routines. What finally spurred the village to take concrete action was news that a resident of a neighboring town had been quarantined, paired with Xiaogan’s announcement that it was halting all public transit services within the city limits. The city’s various counties and villages quickly fell in line by parking buses, shuttering stations, and closing roads. Cadres in some villages used construction waste to fashion makeshift blockades, while others organized shifts to keep an eye on roads into their villages. The local authorities in my area closed the roads down on Jan. 24 — Lunar New Year’s Eve. There was no more denying what was happening. Almost immediately, everyone began looking for face masks. Younger residents tried buying some online, but most outlets had already sold out. Local pharmacies had a limited stock, but this, too, was quickly exhausted. The afternoon our village’s transit links were cut, my father rushed to the nearest town on his scooter, where, after considerable effort, he managed to procure two disposable smog masks. Typically these might cost between 2 and 3 yuan ($0.30 and $0.45) each; he paid 20 yuan apiece. That night, we gathered around the TV to watch the annual Spring Festival gala, but we weren’t in the mood for its usual extravagant skits and performances. Instead we talked about cancelling our yearly New Year’s visits to the other houses in the village — something no one in our deeply traditional village could ever recall happening before.  The first morning of the new year arrived amid deathly silence. We all know who came home from Wuhan, but while word of every cough or fever spreads like wildfire, there’s no sign of panic or prejudice. Local cadres go around the village making announcements reminding residents to wear masks, stay indoors, and not to gather in large numbers. To keep villagers contained, the county government has told gas stations to stop selling gas to vehicles without a state-issued transit pass. With the roads closed, there’s nowhere to go anyway. Bringing goods into the village is no less challenging. Currently local pharmacists rely on their own private channels to procure supplies. It’s impossible to find effective medical-grade masks in local shops, and even the disposable ones are either out of stock or marked up. On Feb. 1, only two of the markets in the nearest town were open, and while they still had most daily necessities available, there was nowhere to buy hand sanitizer, antibacterial spray, or rubbing alcohol.  Over the past few weeks, I’ve seen people make numerous unfounded accusations about my province. Residents hailing from Wuhan but now living elsewhere have been doxed in some parts of the country. Other locals, traveling when the outbreak hit, now can’t find hotels willing to take them in. A few have opted to return home and risk contagion rather than put up with such treatment. I’m not opposed to the quarantine. But it requires respect and trust. Hubei residents are victims, too. Just because we’re at the greatest risk doesn’t make us risks ourselves. China has extended the Lunar New Year holiday as it deals with the crisis. Even so, with our province still on lockdown, many residents worry they’ll be stuck in our hometowns and unable to get back to work. On a more positive note, the village’s old traditions of self-reliance and self-governance have started to reemerge. Everyone says China’s countryside is in decline, and rural Hubei has supposedly fallen into disarray, but this epidemic has brought residents closer together. We don’t know where the virus will hit next, yet in the face of supply shortages and a lack of outside help, many villages are managing to fend for themselves while maintaining order. For example, in one nearby village, residents have organized and set up a system for spreading the alarm whenever new infections are reported, while others have taken the initiative to disinfect their neighborhoods. These villages are our homes. Besides, we have nowhere left to run.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005153
China To Begin Testing Ebola Drug on Coronavirus Patients,"The country’s health authorities approved the trial just days after an academic paper suggested the drug might be effective against the novel coronavirus, but not everyone is convinced.",2020-02-03,"China has announced it will immediately commence clinical trials on an experimental drug, remdesivir, in hopes of finding an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus that has killed over 360 people and infected another 17,000 since mid-December. The trial, which begins Monday and runs through April 27, will take place in the central city of Wuhan and include a total of 270 novel coronavirus patients, Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper reported Sunday. It will be overseen by Cao Bin, an expert in respiratory infections at Beijing’s China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The news comes just three days after a paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine claiming that remdesivir, which is not yet approved by drug regulators in any country, may have helped alleviate the symptoms of a 35-year-old male novel coronavirus patient in Washington state.     According to the NEJM paper, doctors on Jan. 26 administered remdesivir to the unidentified man, who had been diagnosed shortly after returning from a visit to Wuhan. The next day, his condition began to improve, and almost all of his symptoms had subsided by time of publication. The authors noted that they had observed no “adverse events” related to the treatment.  On Jan. 31, the day the paper was published, the drug’s developer, California-based Gilead Sciences, announced it had provided doses of the drug to China for use “in a small number of patients” and was working with China’s health authorities to set up a randomized, controlled trial to test the drug’s effectiveness against the novel coronavirus. Historically, unapproved or in-development drugs have sometimes been used to treat diseases for which there are no accepted alternatives. Although there is no clinical data on remdesivir’s effectiveness against the novel coronavirus, the company claims it has been used in animal subjects to treat two other coronaviruses — SARS and MERS — with some success. A 2018 clinical trial found it was less effective than other drugs at treating Ebola, another viral disease.  On Feb. 2, China’s Center for Drug Evaluation announced it had approved Gilead Sciences’ application, with trials to begin the next day. As of time of publication, neither the China-Japan Friendship Hospital nor Cao, the doctor overseeing the trials, had responded to Sixth Tone’s requests for comment. There are currently no drugs approved to treat the novel coronavirus. Although a number of companies including Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline have announced work on a vaccine, development is expected to take years. In the meantime, Chinese researchers are experimenting with existing antiviral drugs, including those for MERS and HIV, in hopes of finding an effective stopgap. In addition to the just-announced remdesivir trial, doctors at Wuhan’s Jin Yin-tan Hospital last month launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, a cocktail often marketed as Kaletra. The pairing, which a previous study suggested might be effective against SARS, work by targeting protease, an enzyme both HIV and coronaviruses use to reproduce. Others are working to decode the novel coronavirus to speed up the search for potentially effective treatments. XtalPi, a Massachusetts-based biotech startup, announced Sunday that it had screened 2,900 FDA-approved drugs against novel coronavirus proteins and found 96 on-the-market drugs that could potentially inhibit the virus’ activity. “We got a list of drug repurposing candidates and predicted their binding affinity ranking,” Lai Lipeng, the company’s co-founder and head of AI research, told Sixth Tone. “By sharing this list with the rest of the research community, we hope to help expand the search for a cure for the novel coronavirus, find partners who can experimentally validate these candidates, and hopefully shorten the time needed for an effective treatment to reach patients.”    According to Lu Hongzhou, a leading virologist at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital, new antivirals like remdesivir may be more effective than existing drugs such as lopinavir. Unlike lopinavir, which seeks to block the virus from reproducing, Lu says remdesivir acts directly on the virus itself.  “The drug would work on patients in any condition, and starting the treatment in the early stages of the illness can improve the prognosis,” Lu told Sixth Tone. “If we can get the virus early, we can stop it from further damaging the body and prevent the sick from getting sicker.” Not everyone is as sanguine about the experimental drug’s potential, however. Jiang Xuefeng, a professor of chemistry and molecular engineering at East China Normal University in Shanghai, warns that one isolated case in the U.S. is not statistically significant. “No random, controlled, or blank samples were used in that case,” he told Sixth Tone. “The effectiveness of remdesivir cannot be determined by this single case.” According to Jiang, even if remdesivir does prove effective in treating novel coronavirus patients, that doesn’t make it safe to use: It can take years, he said, to fully understand the pharmacological and toxicological side effects of new drugs. “Take thalidomide, for example. It was sold to pregnant women as a cure for morning sickness in the 1950s, but four or five years later people discovered that it was causing birth defects,” Jiang said. “Given the circumstances, it’s totally understandable that people want a cure for the novel coronavirus as soon as possible. But as scientists, we have to be extremely cautious.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005155

Shanghai Asks Residents To Sign Up for Orderly Mask Distribution,"With more coronavirus cases each day, the city is likely to see a surge in demand as people return following the Spring Festival holiday.",2020-02-01,"SHANGHAI — Cheng Xiumei was surprised to find that no one was lined up to buy face masks at her neighborhood pharmacy on Saturday. Dozens of residents had waited outside in the cold the previous day hoping to snatch up one of the hottest commodities of the public health crisis currently unfolding in China. Instead, the 50-year-old elder care worker found a notice at her local pharmacy in the central Jing’an District asking would-be customers to register with their neighborhood committees beginning Sunday to receive vouchers for picking up masks from designated pharmacies the following day. “I still have more than 30 disposable masks left, but I need to use one mask a day for hygiene purposes (when taking care of my client),” said Cheng, who hails from the northeastern Jilin province. Cheng is among hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Chinese who haven’t been able to obtain new face masks, with demand driven up by the novel coronavirus that has spread to every provincial-level region of China, as well as dozens of other countries. Authorities have strongly urged — and in some cities compelled — people to cover their noses and mouths with a mask as a precaution against the virus, which so far has killed 259 people in the country and infected nearly 12,000 others.  Last week, Chinese health experts said disposable masks should be worn daily, and changed every two to four hours, in accordance with a new guideline from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. However, amid dwindling supplies, some local disease control and prevention centers, including one in Beijing, have recommended that people reuse disposable masks if they aren’t “wet or dirty.” To alleviate the mask crunch, Shanghai’s city government has been collaborating with local mask manufacturers and pharmacies since Jan. 28, aiming to ensure that the supply chain to residents is not disrupted. From Saturday, the city temporarily suspended the sale of masks at pharmacies in a bid to prevent crowds and chaos. The factory closures and suspended delivery services over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday — which was further extended through Feb. 2 — have strained supply chains as demand intensifies in places like Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and other large cities across the country.  Products from popular mask suppliers to China such as the American brand 3M are constantly selling out online. Though anti-pollen and cloth masks are still available in some online stores, they’re not as effective as N95 masks — which claim to block 95% of harmful particles in the air — or surgical masks, according to health experts. Domestic mask makers have nonetheless moved to ramp up production during the holiday period, begging employees to cut their breaks short and attempting to lure them with overtime pay. At Shanghai Dasheng, one of the city’s mask manufacturers, there were nearly two dozen employees working 24-hour shifts until their colleagues returned, according to the company’s founder, Wu Shengrong.  “We can produce 70,000 to 80,000 masks a day (now),” Wu said. “When more employees return, we will be able to produce 200,000 masks a day.” As of Thursday, all 17 mask manufacturers in Shanghai had resumed operations, producing a total of 1.5 million masks that day, according to Li Jia, an official with the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization. “Currently, we’re not selling any masks on our own,” Wu said. “The government is in charge of that.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005151
‘Rumormonger’ Doctor Who Raised the Alarm Says He Has Coronavirus,Wuhan police had reprimanded Li Wenliang after the ophthalmologist warned a chat group of fellow doctors in late December of the possible return of SARS.,2020-02-01,"Update: Dr. Li Wenliang died in the early hours of Feb. 7 at the age of 34, according to the hospital where he worked and was being treated for the coronavirus. The subsequent outpouring of grief and anger catapulted the news of his passing to the top-trending topic on microblogging platform Weibo. Initial media reports cited conflicting times of death. A doctor in Wuhan who is believed to be one of the eight whistleblowers police reprimanded in early January for “spreading rumors” about a mysterious pneumonia has become infected with the coronavirus that causes it. “Today’s nucleic acid (novel coronavirus) test came back positive. Everything is settled now — it’s finally confirmed,” Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, wrote Saturday morning on his Weibo microblog. His workplace, Wuhan Central, is one of the city’s designated medical facilities for admitting and treating suspected and confirmed coronavirus patients. By Saturday morning, the novel coronavirus had killed 259 people in China and infected nearly 12,000, over half of whom reside in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. Prior to his diagnosis, Li had been working on the front lines of the epidemic. Around Jan. 10, he developed a cough and fever, and later had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. His parents were hospitalized with similar symptoms. In a separate post Friday, Li recounted how, on Dec. 30, he had examined the medical report of a patient whose condition seemed strikingly similar to SARS, also caused by a coronavirus. Li decided to share this discovery with his former medical school classmates so that they might take appropriate precautions. In their class WeChat group, he sent a message that read: “Seven cases of SARS confirmed.” “After I sent the message, the police found me and made me sign an official letter of criticism,” Li said. According to a photo of the letter included in Li’s post, the police chastised him on Jan. 3 for “making untrue comments” that had “severely disturbed the social order.”  “The police hope that you can actively cooperate with us, heed our advice, and stop your illegal behavior. Can you do this?” Li writes, “Yes, I can.” “We hope you can calm down and reflect on your behavior. We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice — is that understood?” Li answers, “Yes, I do.” His signature and fingerprint appear at the bottom of the document. On Jan. 1, the Wuhan police announced on Weibo that eight people had been summoned and punished for “spreading rumors” about the city’s pneumonia patients. After China’s state broadcaster reported on Jan. 9 that a new type of coronavirus was responsible for the unusual number of pneumonia cases, people began to question whether the “rumormongers” had been unjustly punished, prompting the Wuhan police to restrict viewing access to their Jan. 1 Weibo post. On Tuesday, the Supreme People’s Court, the country’s highest judicial authority, criticized the Wuhan police for reprimanding the whistleblowers in an article published on the court’s official WeChat account. The next day, the Wuhan police wrote on Weibo that the whistleblowers had only been “educated and criticized,” and had not been “warned, fined, or taken into custody.” A leading scientist from the National Health Commission weighed in on the case during a livestreamed interview that evening. “Those eight individuals are admirable,” he said. “Hindsight is 20-20, but these people had foresight.” Li has received similarly strong support online, with his posts garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and countless comments from people expressing their gratitude. “Doctor Li, you are a great doctor with a kind heart and good conscience. I hope you’re at peace,” read the top comment under his Friday post.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005150
The Wuhan Pneumonia Patient Trapped Between Despair and Hope,"Ten days after Zhang Chi first went to the hospital with a high fever and lung infection, he has yet to receive a conclusive diagnosis.",2020-02-01,"SHANGHAI — Double pneumonia: The results of the CT scan were as unmistakable as they were unbelievable. Zhang Chi’s temperature had remained stable for the past five days. It was Thursday, and he had been eating and sleeping well, his energy and spirit gradually returning. The day before, he had been talking with other pneumonia patients online about the apparent success of his home-based recovery regimen, after several hospitals refused to admit him. Now, he feels lost. “I did everything I could: I took all the medicine I was told to, I ate nutritious meals at regular intervals, I made sure I got enough sleep,” Zhang tells Sixth Tone by phone on Thursday afternoon. He is seated in his car outside Wuhan Central Hospital, where he’s been waiting for four hours, with 90 people still ahead of him in line. Thursday wasn’t Zhang’s first trip to a hospital, or even to this hospital. Five days earlier, on Jan. 25, he had seen a doctor at Wuhan Central after his fever returned, only to be told to return home and try not to come into contact with others. “They told me, ‘Don’t go to a hospital — what you need is good rest,’” the 39-year-old says, adding that the doctor prescribed him oseltamivir, a generic version of Tamiflu. Zhang did as he was told, but his respiratory infection worsened, spreading from one lung to both.  Zhang was born and raised in Wuhan, a transport hub in central China that’s home to some 14 million people. Lately, he’s been sticking to the same routine, visiting three local supermarkets to see how their stocks are holding up. He sets out from his home in Jiang’an District, around 1 kilometer from the south entrance of the sprawling South China Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first coronavirus infections are believed to have occurred. By Friday morning, the virus had killed 213 people in China and infected over 9,700 more.  In Wuhan, the tension is palpable, with residents’ nerves easily frayed by the slightest abnormality in their health, or in that of their loved ones. Police cars patrol the streets, loudspeakers blaring, urging residents to stay indoors and pay close attention to their personal hygiene. Just days ago, some locals were still joking about the supposed scourge as they left the city for long-planned Lunar New Year trips. “I drive past the South China Seafood Wholesale Market every day,” Zhang says. “I didn’t sense that anything big had happened in the city, even though I noticed earlier this month that the market was closed one day while driving by.” Zhang first heard rumblings of a mysterious, unidentified virus in late December, but he says he was soon convinced that it was just a rumor. “Everyone knows you’re not supposed to believe or spread rumors!” he laughs. Now, looking back at everything that’s happened, he admits he was naïve. According to Zhang, Wuhan felt the same as usual as late as Jan. 20, when a bunch of his friends shared the same picture on social app WeChat: a young man in a surgical mask, sitting with his legs crossed and holding a lotus flower, the words “Don’t come near me, I’m from Wuhan” printed on top.  “Back then, it was still a joke — we thought it was funny,” Zhang says. “We all heard about the virus spreading but didn’t believe it was a big problem. In my experience, most Wuhan people are pretty carefree and laid-back.” For the Lunar New Year holiday, Zhang and his family had planned to take a meandering tour by car of the areas surrounding Wuhan, as they had done in years past. Those plans were deflated when, a day after Zhang shared the viral picture of the young man with the lotus, he came down with a fever.  His muscles sore, his entire body weak, Zhang went to a pharmacy to buy a thermometer on Jan. 21. When his temperature read 38.5 degrees Celsius, he went straight to Hubei Xinhua Hospital, one of the province’s top medical facilities. “It wasn’t until I arrived at the hospital and saw medical workers in protective suits that I realized how serious it had become,” Zhang says. When a CT scan showed an infection in Zhang’s right lung, he asked to be tested for the novel coronavirus. The hospital rejected his request, saying there was a shortage of test kits. So Zhang sprang into action, consulting his friends and searching online for information related to the virus. “I hadn’t visited the seafood market or come into contact with any fever patients,” he tells Sixth Tone. “But after reading through all the available information, I was sure I had been infected with the virus — I just had no idea how.”  As of Saturday morning, over 7,100 novel coronavirus infections had been confirmed in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. Nearly 18,000 suspected cases nationwide are still waiting to be tested and confirmed. The shortage of test kits is largely due to there being so few labs qualified to administer and evaluate them, a disease control officer from the southwestern Yunnan province told Sanlian Life Weekly, a domestic magazine. “For newly discovered infectious diseases, the state mandates that, to prevent infection, tests must be carried out in labs that meet certain biosafety standards (Level 2 or higher). Most hospitals simply don’t have such labs,” said the officer, who was not named in the report.  Wuhan resident Yuan Yuan has taken his 58-year-old father to three different hospitals trying to get a diagnosis for his high fever, but he’s been unable to get a clear answer beyond confirmation that it’s a virus. “I asked the doctors if they could rule out the possibility of my father being infected with the novel coronavirus, and they all replied no,” the 23-year-old tells Sixth Tone. “One of them told me that if a patient isn’t suffering from severe symptoms or complications, they’re not likely to be hospitalized or taken for further tests, given the extremely limited number of hospitals in the city that are qualified to administer the coronavirus test.”  Many people who think they might be infected with the coronavirus are all too familiar with the difficulty of getting the one test with the power to either confirm or allay their fears. On Jan. 21, the results of a standard blood test informed Zhang that he had a virus, though it wasn’t the common flu or any of the usual culprits. “The doctors I saw seemed very cautious about giving their real medical opinions,” Zhang says. With his elderly parents and young daughter at home, Zhang decided to quarantine himself at a local hotel on the 21st — three days before the first day of the Spring Festival holiday and two days before Wuhan was placed under citywide lockdown, with virtually all transport services suspended. The day of the lockdown was Zhang’s third at the hotel. His condition had improved and his temperature had come down. But he had also started vomiting occasionally — a side effect, he assumed, of his anti-flu pills. He did not know that, in addition to high fever and weakness, people infected with the novel coronavirus have also shown gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting and diarrhea.  On Jan. 24, Wuhan Union Hospital, another top medical facility in the city, released an updated medication guideline for anyone with viral pneumonia. In addition to the oseltamivir tablets that Zhang had been taking, the guideline recommended moxifloxacin, an antibiotic for treating respiratory infections, as well as another antiviral drug, umifenovir, which serves a similar purpose as oseltamivir. Zhang enlisted help from his friends to seek out moxifloxacin and umifenovir: He knew that, even if he were to brave the long lines and cross-infection risks at a hospital, a doctor would be unlikely to prescribe him more than minimal medication, given his relatively mild symptoms. Fortunately, as president of a local soccer fans’ club with over 1,000 members, Zhang had a lot of friends. When his fever went back up to 37.5 degrees on Jan. 24, Zhang tried to stay hopeful, believing in his ability to conquer the illness. “I play soccer a lot and have even run a few marathons,” Zhang says proudly. The next day, however, Zhang’s confidence evaporated, giving way to desperation. At 6 a.m. on Jan. 25 — the first day of the Year of Rat — the hotel where he was staying told him he had to leave.  “They didn’t tell me the reason, saying only that the hotel was being commandeered by the authorities,” he says. Over 6,000 medical workers arrived in Wuhan this week to assist with containment and treatment efforts, and they’re being put up at hotels near the hospitals where they’ll be working — hotels like Zhang’s. More bad news followed. A second CT scan showed that the infection in Zhang’s right lung had worsened, and private cars were being barred from the city’s downtown area from Jan. 26, meaning he’d have difficulty getting to and from hospitals.  “I had no place to go! I would rather have been locked up somewhere with someone to give me a coronavirus test,” Zhang says. Hours before the blockade was to take effect, Zhang drove his car under a bridge, where a friend from the soccer fans’ club delivered the drugs he needed. That night Zhang called a local community office, which arranged temporary accommodation for him at another hotel. On his second day there, two security guards escorted him to a local health center. “The doctors didn’t examine me,” Zhang says. “I was told to go home, take some medicine, and wait.” Wuhan’s fever patients are currently being managed by community workers. People are asked to first report their symptoms to community center staff, who can then connect them with local hospitals for a preliminary checkup. Anyone not showing serious symptoms is encouraged to stay indoors. Before returning to his home, Zhang asked his relatives to take his daughter away. His parents, both in their 60s, would not be budged, vowing to stay and cook nutritious meals for their son to speed along his recovery.  Completely drained by a week’s worth of fear and anxiety, Zhang slept for 24 hours, waking up to a clear mind and a normal temperature. He was pleased to find that his appetite had returned, and he became active online again, organizing a charity campaign with his soccer fans’ club to buy protective suits for the frontline medical workers.  “They’re the most respected people in Wuhan right now — they’re our guardians,” says Zhang, a passionate son of Wuhan. “I love my hometown. People from Wuhan are direct and outspoken. We don’t easily surrender to adversity.” On Zhang’s third day back home, his temperature was still normal, and he didn’t feel any discomfort. Online, some people asked him how he had managed to get better, and he told them about his home-based recovery regimen, for lack of a better option. Although he was feeling fine, he still went in the next evening for a third CT scan. “People told me that without a CT scan, it’s hard to tell whether I’m really recovering,” he says. Buoyed by days of hope and health, Zhang was devastated when the scan results came Thursday morning: double pneumonia. His condition had worsened, with the infection taking hold in his second lung.  Out of the more than 11,800 coronavirus cases confirmed by Saturday morning, only 246 have made full recoveries. Some patients were discharged from hospitals after a few days, while others have needed up to three weeks. With a referral letter from his designated community hospital in tow, Zhang arrived at Wuhan Central Hospital again on Thursday. Seven hours later, he saw a doctor, only to be told there were no beds or coronavirus test kits available. Again, he was prescribed antibiotics — one package with three moxifloxacin tablets — and told to go home and wait. Since the outbreak was publicly reported, China’s health authorities have accelerated the approval process for coronavirus test kits, and manufacturers of medical masks have been working around the clock. On Friday, the National Health Commission said that supplies of protective equipment for frontline medical workers have improved, though there are still shortages in some areas and facilities. “She (the doctor) just told me to go home and take the pills,” says a crestfallen Zhang. “She didn’t tell me when I should come back to the hospital for another CT scan or how long the recovery might take. I have no idea what’s going on.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005149
"Hubei Police Say Refusing Quarantine, Spitting at People Illegal","Authorities are reminding people to comport themselves well amid the coronavirus epidemic, after an ignominious few behaved badly.",2020-01-30,"Authorities in Hubei province, where China’s novel coronavirus infections are most concentrated, have warned of severe repercussions against anyone caught endangering the personal safety of medical workers or civilians. In a statement Wednesday, the central province’s public security department said that it is forbidden to disturb the normal operations of a medical institution, endanger medical workers’ personal safety, or damage hospital property, under threat of criminal punishment. The statement further said that novel coronavirus carriers who spit at other people to intentionally spread the disease, as well as those who are infected or suspected of being infected but refuse to be quarantined, may bear criminal responsibility. Whoever insults, intentionally injures, or threatens violence against medical personnel may be prosecuted under the law, the bureau said. Causing disturbances at medical institutions — by setting up religious altars, burning joss paper, hanging banners, or blocking gates — may also be criminally punished. As of 10 a.m. Thursday, the novel coronavirus had killed 170 people and infected over 7,700 others in China, according to the National Health Commission. Beyond the mainland, a total of 25 cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, with around 80 additional cases in North America, Europe, and Australasia. Since a mysterious pneumonia was first detected in Wuhan around mid-December, a few places have been implicated in nefarious affairs, such as obstructing the prevention and control of the epidemic, deliberately spreading the virus, and disrupting hospital order, all of which impede containment efforts, the statement said. There have been examples of local communities supporting frontline doctors in Hubei province. This week, employees from a Wuhan restaurant delivered around 1,000 hot meals a day to doctors and supporting medical staff at local hospitals. But Chinese media have also exposed several instances of people behaving badly toward medical workers. At a top hospital in Wuhan, a patient reportedly assaulted a nurse after being told not to take a mask and thermometer home. Meanwhile, a doctor at the same hospital told local media that a patient had deliberately removed a face mask and coughed on the doctor after a CT scan revealed viral pneumonia. “Some patients have torn off our face masks and spat on us,” one Wuhan doctor was quoted as saying.  On Wednesday night, two doctors at a Wuhan hospital were attacked by the relative of a deceased coronavirus patient, according to The Beijing News. Local police detained the assailant the next day. One of the doctors, surnamed Gao, told medical news platform Dingxiangyuan that his case was insignificant, as people are attacked in all walks of life. “The most important thing right now is to deal with the outbreak,” he said. “I don’t want to dampen the morale of the medical staff, because the epidemic is very serious at the moment.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005147
Dispatches From Hubei: Two Weeks Between Life and Death,"A Hubei resident recounts his wife’s final days, and his battle to save her.",2020-01-30,"Weng Qiuqiu never learned what killed her. The disease moved fast. Over the course of just 12 days, the 32-year-old resident of Huanggang City in China’s central Hubei province went from complaining of a headache and cough to being diagnosed with an “unknown” type of pneumonia and put on a respirator, says her husband Chen Yong. Finally, on Jan. 21, 2020, after burning through 200,000 yuan ($29,000) in less than two weeks — the totality of their life’s savings plus everything they could raise from family, friends, and a crowdsourcing campaign — and with no sign of improvement, Chen agreed to take his wife off life support. For weeks, Hubei has been wracked by a novel coronavirus epidemic that has sickened thousands and left over 100 dead, according to official figures. But even these numbers may not tell the full story. On Jan. 24, a research group affiliated with Wuhan University hospital warned doctors that the novel coronavirus’ wide-ranging symptoms make it difficult to identify and treat. Weng’s death certificate says only that she died of “septic shock, respiratory failure, and severe pneumonia.” Chen still doesn’t know if she had the novel coronavirus, or if such a diagnosis could have saved his wife’s life. Huanggang lies just over 75 kilometers away from the provincial capital of Wuhan, where the outbreak started, and it has been among the areas hardest hit by the epidemic, with almost 500 infections and 12 deaths. As Weng clung to life, municipal and provincial officials belatedly escalated their response to the crisis. They have since ordered more test kits, given designated hospitals the authority to confirm cases on their own, and shut down public transportation in and out of a number of cities. And at 5 p.m. on Jan. 21, just hours after Weng died, the Wuhan city government announced it would cover the medical bills of all those infected. None of that helps Chen when his young daughter asks where her mother went, however, nor does it soothe his thoughts of the second child Weng was carrying when she died. Instead he’s wracked with guilt: Some of Weng’s fellow patients have gradually started to recover, leaving him to wonder what might have happened if they’d been able to hold out just a little while longer. The following is Chen Yong’s story, as told to Sixth Tone’s sister publication, The Paper, and edited for brevity and clarity.  Part 1 On Jan. 7, my wife went to a wet market to buy a fish head, chicken, and some vegetables to make hot pot. We all had dinner together and her appetite was good; she ate plenty. The next day was our daughter’s last day of school before the Lunar New Year holiday. My wife said she wasn’t feeling well, and asked me to pick our daughter up. On the 9th, the two of them spent all day at home. Around noon, my wife messaged me and said she had a cold. She asked me to pick up some cold medication on my way home from work, as well as a pregnancy test. I got off work a little after 5 p.m., and came home with the medicine and the test. A few hours later, at around 6 or 7 o’clock, she told me she was pregnant. I was happy. I made dinner that night: fried pork liver, pickled vegetables, and some greens. She had a big bowl of rice, but seemed a little off. Afterward, I went to wash the dishes and she returned to our room to sleep. I figured she had a cold and just needed some rest, and I soon followed her to bed. But at about 3 a.m., she suddenly shook me awake and told me she didn’t feel well. Her head and throat hurt, and she had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius. I quickly took her to Huanggang Hospital of TCM — one of the city’s top-rated medical institutions. There was no one to watch our daughter, so we took her with us rather than leave her at home alone. The doctors told us they couldn’t give my wife an IV drip until the morning, so all we could do was pick up some cold medicine. On the way home it started to rain, and by the time we got back it was around 4 a.m. My wife was coughing nonstop and neither of us could sleep. Only my daughter got any rest. It rained the whole day on Jan. 10. We got up at around 7 a.m. and went back to the hospital. The doctors ran some tests and told us her throat was inflamed. But they couldn’t give her any medicine or injections because she was pregnant. It was already noon by the time they finished, so we decided to go home first, then head to Huanggang Women’s Hospital in the afternoon. I made my wife some millet porridge for lunch, but she could only manage a few bites.  That afternoon, we went to Huanggang Women’s Hospital. The doctors there said the same thing: She was pregnant and couldn’t take medicine or receive shots. So we went back to the TCM hospital — this time to the respiratory clinic. By that point, my wife was having trouble breathing; she was weak and could barely walk. She was also experiencing chills The doctors gave her an electrocardiogram before telling us to go the municipal hospital downtown. When we couldn’t get in to see a doctor there, we went to the smaller Huanggang Tongji Hospital instead. It was already late afternoon, and we’d been carrying our daughter around with us all day. I called my brother-in-law and asked him to come by and take the girl to her grandfather’s house. I then sat on a stool and asked my wife how she felt about being admitted, rather than leaving and coming back the next day. She couldn’t speak, but she kept nodding her head. It was painful to watch. That was a long day. At 11 p.m., my wife was transferred to a top hospital in Wuhan. I’d heard a few days earlier that there’d been a pneumonia outbreak in that city, but there’d been no cases reported in Huanggang, so I hadn’t given it much thought. The doctors also didn’t say anything about it. My only concern was figuring out how to pay to keep my wife alive and how to get her into the best hospital possible. After she was admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, the doctors there told me my wife had a germ infection. They said her lung scan came back completely white.  Part 2 My wife and I moved to Huanggang from nearby Qichun County about six months ago. We invested 30,000 yuan and opened a store that sold windows and doors with a few other people. We wanted to change our lives; we never thought something like this would happen. The store had just opened, and we had yet to turn a profit. We took home about 3,000 yuan a month in salary, but with rent, living expenses, and our daughter’s preschool bills, we’d been in the red for half a year. In Wuhan, my wife was first admitted into the fever clinic, but at around 1 or 2 in the morning on Jan. 11 she was transferred to the ER, and then moved into an observation ward for those in critical condition. There were a lot of people in the hospital that night. Some of the patients’ family members weren’t wearing masks, but many of the doctors and nurses were. I asked a nurse for a few. From the moment my wife went to the fever clinic, she was kept in isolation. The doctors told me she had an unknown type of pneumonia. The next day, they said her condition was critical, and they would need to revise her treatment plan. She needed some kind of machine, they said. All I knew was that it would be expensive: 20,000 yuan a day, and even then, there was only a 10% chance she’d survive. I was on the verge of a breakdown. I hadn’t had any rest in days. Finally, on the morning of Jan. 12, I found a chair in the hospital and went to sleep for an hour. My mom and I eventually got a room in a hostel nearby. Many of the other people staying there also had family members who were being treated for pneumonia.  I wasn’t allowed to see my wife, so I spent every day cooped up in the hostel thinking of ways to raise money. While we were still in Huanggang, I’d borrowed 10,000 yuan from my brother, and I later made the rounds among both our families. I was scared: I only knew that she couldn’t stop treatment. I had to get her back. I called the mayor’s hotline, the provincial governor’s hotline, and the numbers of several media outlets. I also launched a crowdfunding campaign that brought in about 40,000 yuan. But it was nowhere near enough. In the first three days after she was admitted, her treatment cost between 50,000 and 60,000 yuan a day, and another 20,000 each day after that. I wanted to see her. I wanted to talk to her and ask her how she was doing, what she wanted to eat, or if there was anything she wanted to do. But I couldn’t. Every time I called her doctors, they told me she still hadn’t woken up, and that her condition hadn’t improved or that she’d gotten worse. Her pregnancy made her more vulnerable. Her doctors said her hands turned purple, then her feet. It was necrosis. It all happened so fast. After she was put into an observation ward on Jan. 11, I wouldn’t see her again until I picked up her ashes 11 days later.  Part 3 By noon on Jan. 21, I had exhausted every available resource, and my wife was showing no signs of improvement. Utterly heartbroken, I talked it over with my in-laws before signing a waiver agreeing to halt further treatment. An hour later, at 1:46 p.m., my wife died. She was cremated later that night. Her death certificate says she died of “septic shock, respiratory failure, and severe pneumonia.” I found out later that an elderly fellow patient of hers, one whose condition had also been very serious, has slowly recovered with treatment — though not yet enough to leave the isolation ward. It’s hard to process. My in-laws don’t blame me, but I feel guilty. Sometimes I think she might have gotten better, but at the time there was just no hope. We had spent almost 200,000 yuan, almost all of it borrowed. We sold our stake in the door and window company, and our state-provided insurance for rural residents covered another 60,000 yuan. When I was a migrant worker, I used to bring home between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan a year. My wife stayed at home and made curtains or clothes. We were married seven years but never saved much. We had no house, and we sold our car. Our only property is my parents’ old house. The day after my wife died, I went to the hospital to fill out paperwork, then to the crematorium to pick up her ashes. There were 10 or so other people there. Afterward, I took the bus back to my home village. I haven’t been back to Huanggang since. I can’t sleep. I lie awake in bed, my mind racing. I can’t put this pain into words. It’s still the Lunar New Year holiday, but my home feels cold and cheerless. My neighbors are terrified, and almost everyone hides in their houses. My daughter’s too young to understand what happened. Sometimes she asks me where her mother went and I don’t know what to tell her. Weng Qiuqiu and Chen Yong are pseudonyms.

Wuhan Expands New Hospital Plans As Coronavirus Cases Climb,"Two temporary hospitals already under construction will be scaled up to accommodate as many as 2,600 patients.",2020-01-29,"Two pop-up hospitals being built at lightning speed to cope with the coronavirus outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan will be expanded to house more patients and medical staff, domestic media reported Wednesday. According to a blueprint of Huoshenshan Hospital released Tuesday, the facility will be expanded from 25,000 square meters to 33,900 square meters — nearly the size of five soccer fields — with a total capacity of 1,000 beds. The construction of the temporary medical facility was announced Jan. 24 and scheduled for completion in just six days, on Feb. 1, because of the rapidly rising number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections in the country. As of noon Wednesday, the coronavirus had killed 132 people in China and infected nearly 6,000 others, according to official data. Meanwhile, there are over 9,200 suspected cases in the country, the National Health Commission said. When completed, Huoshenshan Hospital will have patient wards, intensive care units, supply rooms, a medical technology department, a temporary waste storage room, and an ambulance decontamination room, among other facilities. To handle the growing number of patients, Wuhan authorities announced Saturday that the city would build a second temporary medical site, the 1,300-bed Leishenshan Hospital, by Feb. 5. Leishenshan Hospital, located 50 kilometers southeast of Huoshenshan, is being expanded to about 60,000 square meters, according to media reports. Its patient capacity is also being increased to around 1,600, while its on-site accommodation area will be able to house more than 2,000 medical staff. In recent days, people throughout Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, have voiced concerns about medical supply shortages, overcrowded hospitals, and overworked staff. In the meantime, doctors and nurses from across the country have been dispatched to Wuhan to provide additional medical aid, and officials are counting on the new hospitals to accommodate all suspected patients who might otherwise be turned away due to a lack of resources. Online, millions of people are tuning in to follow the construction of the two hospitals in real time. On Wednesday afternoon, a livestream on state broadcaster China Central Television’s mobile app attracted some 13 million concurrent viewers. “It’s fascinating to see how two hospitals can be built in just one week,” said Chen Hui, a Shanghai native who, like millions of others in China’s major cities, has stayed indoors for the majority of the holidays to reduce the likelihood of being exposed to the virus. “When I’m watching, I feel like I’m not only a supporter and spectator, but also a participant and supervisor,” Chen told Sixth Tone. Hundreds of kilometers from the two construction sites in Wuhan, Beijing’s Xiaotangshan Hospital is also being reopened after 17 years. The hospital was famously built in seven days in April 2003 to treat patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, when that coronavirus killed nearly 800 people worldwide. This time around, the hospital will spring into action to treat the latest coronavirus epidemic. Zhengzhou, capital of the central Henan province, has also broken ground on the construction of a new quarantine ward for treating people with the novel coronavirus. The 300-room facility is scheduled to be ready for use in just under 10 days.  and Leishenshan Hospital (right) on Jan. 29, 2020. Ding Yining/Sixth Tone)",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005145
"Leading Expert on Epidemic Outcomes, ‘Psychological Intervention’","Zhang Wenhong, the infectious disease expert tasked with managing Shanghai’s response to the novel coronavirus, spoke to Sixth Tone about the epidemic’s present state and possible future.",2020-01-29,"With the Wuhan coronavirus infecting thousands of people in China and growing numbers abroad, many provincial-level regions are appointing teams of doctors and scientists to manage emergency relief efforts and localized cases. Zhang Wenhong, a leading infectious disease expert at the Fudan University-affiliated Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, has been tasked with leading such a team in the eastern megacity. He spoke to media, including Sixth Tone, at a press event Wednesday morning. Here are our five takeaways from that meeting: A spike in confirmed cases isn’t inherently scary One hundred thirty deaths and 6,000 confirmed infections are big, alarming numbers — but they should be considered within their full context, according to Zhang. “The soaring number of confirmed patients these days, especially in Wuhan, is because of improved detection capabilities,” the doctor said. Now, anyone who is sick or thinks they might be sick is being evaluated by medical staff, he said, and there’s a greater likelihood they’ll have access to test kits for the novel coronavirus. On Tuesday, China’s National Medical Products Administration approved two more 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test kit products, adding to the four products already on the market. “Wuhan is trying to ascertain the total number of existing cases,” Zhang said. “This does not mean an exacerbation of the epidemic situation, but rather that adequate diagnostic measures are in place.” The novel coronavirus is incredibly virulent According to current research, the Wuhan coronavirus is at least twice as virulent as Ebola and nearly as virulent as HIV, Zhang said. He acknowledged that some scientists have expressed pessimistic outlooks for the coronavirus epidemic. “And they’re right,” Zhang said, adding that the virus would spread “very fast” if left uncontrolled. “But such projections don’t take external factors into account — they’re purely mathematical,” Zhang said. Earlier this week, Gabriel Leung and his peers at Hong Kong University’s faculty of medicine estimated that there were 25,630 symptomatic patients in Wuhan, and that this number could double in less than a week, based on a mathematical model using available data. According to Zhang, however, external factors “always matter.” “China has taken unprecedented measures to fight the virus,” he said, pointing to cities being put on lockdown, the Spring Festival holiday being extended, and health care workers and volunteers implementing “grid management” to uncover potential coronavirus cases in their local communities. “Personally,” Zhang said, “I feel that these considerable external factors would disrupt a mathematical model.” Containment outside Wuhan critical Chinese health authorities have traced the novel coronavirus to a wet market in Wuhan that sold a variety of unusual animals, with the first patient showing symptoms as early as Dec. 12. Since then, Zhang said, nearly all coronavirus cases outside the central Chinese city have been found to be “imported,” meaning the patients contracting the virus either in Wuhan or from people who had been to Wuhan. “The chain of virus transmission is clear,” Zhang said. “But we have to be very cautious: If a region suddenly has a number of cases whose source of transmission cannot be identified, or if the region has its own second- and third-generation viruses (with the initial virus having mutated), this would mean the infectious disease has started circulating internally in that region.” “This would be a very serious thing,” Zhang said, referring to this possibility of new mini-epicenters. “If this happened, we would have to declare the failure of the ‘defense campaign’ in that region and move on to the next step: not just focusing on cases imported from Wuhan, but screening any patient with a fever.” ‘Psychological intervention’ essential to prevent panic Because the Wuhan coronavirus is “so ferocious,” some people — and especially infected patients — might be tempted to panic, Zhang said. “That’s why, apart from medical treatment, psychological intervention is also very important,” he said. “Luckily, we’ve already recognized this and taken action.” Shanghai has sent seven “psychological interventionists” to Wuhan, the doctor said, and the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center has a psychiatrist on duty in its coronavirus ward to talk with or comfort patients who might be depressed or overwhelmed with unfounded fears. Three outcome scenarios: one good, one bad, one ugly Scenario 1: Win“This would entail no patients still requiring treatment after two to four weeks, and controlling the epidemic within two to three months. This, of course, is the most optimistic situation.” Scenario 2: Hold“This means we partially control the epidemic, with cases continuing to climb, but at a mild rate. The anti-epidemic measures (under this scenario) might last from six months to one year, as was the case with SARS.” Scenario 3: Failure“This means the new virus would evolve to become a recurring seasonal disease,” Zhang said, adding that such an outcome would be “so dangerous.” “What we want to do is erase the virus from the human realm, driving it back into nature, back to the wild, back into its cave,” Zhang said. “When can we manage to do that? It’s hard to tell. At present, we can only hear the clock tick without knowing what time it is.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005144
"Amid Coronavirus Epidemic, Taobao Cracks Down on Fake Face Masks",The Chinese e-commerce platform says it shut down more than 80 vendors after customers reported them for selling fake masks.,2020-01-28,"Over 80 shops on e-commerce platform Taobao allegedly sold fake 3M and N95 face masks, Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper reported Monday. On Monday, the Alibaba-owned marketplace wrote on its official Weibo microblog that it had checked all shops flagged by customers and removed those that it found to be engaging in false advertising or price gouging. Taobao also said it would assist customers seeking refunds. Some customers who bought masks on the platform said they received “risk alerts” warning them of potentially unreliable products or vendors. Taobao said in its post that while some vendors would require closer scrutiny, the fraudulent products had been removed, as “health is the priority.” The company urged users to report further suspected fraud on its mobile app. The novel coronavirus epidemic originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has led to a severe shortage of face masks. Over the span of just two days last week, more than 80 million masks were sold on Taobao, prompting some mask merchants to beg their employees who had gone home for Spring Festival to come back to work, in some cases for up to five times their regular wages. As of noon Tuesday, the novel coronavirus had killed 106 people and infected over 4,500 in China, with a further 6,973 suspected cases in the country. Taobao said it has been taking orders and delivering face masks in nearly 300 cities across the country over the Spring Festival holiday, when online sellers typically take around two weeks off to spend time with family. Taobao previously said it had warned mask merchants operating on its platform that any unusual price hikes would not be tolerated. As the outbreak spreads, local governments have begun making masks mandatory in public places. On Sunday, the government of the southern Guangdong province issued a notice ordering people to wear face masks in public under threat of punishment by public security organs. Since Monday, authorities in the northern city of Shijiazhuang have made masks a requirement for using the subway system. The northeastern Jilin province on Monday carried out an inspection to ensure that prices for face masks and other protective equipment were not being inflated. Authorities said that any illegal commercial behavior — such as price gouging or hoarding — could result in the products in question being confiscated, as well as a maximum fine of 3 million yuan ($432,000). On Monday afternoon, the public security bureau of Yiwu, a manufacturing hub in the eastern Zhejiang province, announced that over 50,000 fake face masks had been seized, and that at least five people had been detained for selling fake or inferior products.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005143
Coronavirus Highlights Perils of China’s Illegal Wildlife Trade,The country’s leading scientists and scholars have called for an urgent crackdown on the trade and consumption of wild animals.,2020-01-25,"Updates: On Jan. 26, three Cabinet-level agencies announced a ban on domestic wildlife trade for the duration of the COVID-19 epidemic. On Feb. 24, the country’s top policymakers, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, made the ban permanent. A number of China’s leading scientists have called for a crackdown on the country’s illegal wildlife trade as well as legislation against the consumption of wild animals, amid the novel coronavirus outbreak that is believed to have originated at a wet market in the central city of Wuhan where dozens of unusual animal species were sold. Nineteen scientists and scholars from China’s leading institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a joint statement Friday proposing legislation against the consumption of wild animals as a grave matter of public health. “Limiting or even prohibiting eating wildlife and related trades is not only important for ecological conservation, but also because of the great significance for controlling public health risks,” the statement said. China’s illegal wildlife trade has been thrust into the spotlight following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that, as of time of publication, had killed 41 people and infected over 1,200 in the country. The first infections were traced to a market in Wuhan that reportedly sold meat from a wide variety of unusual animals, including camels, kangaroos, masked palm civets, and the Chinese porcupine, among others.  Lü Zhi, a professor of conservation biology at Peking University and a co-author of the open letter, told Sixth Tone that it is often difficult to verify the real source of the animals sold at such markets — whether they’re from certified breeding centers or captured in the wild, for example. It’s not uncommon for animals caught in the wild to be sent to certified breeding centers before being sold at market, and not all certified breeding center go through legal channels to obtain their licenses. “How can one tell (the source of an animal) if it has already become meat? There are lots of situations where people might ‘hang up a sheep’s head while selling dog meat,’” Lü said, using a Chinese adage meaning doing wicked deeds under a banner of virtue. “Domesticating and breeding wild animals is expensive, while purchasing one caught from the wild is cheap. As long as this illicit market exists, the (trade) chain will persist.” According to a study published Wednesday by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the natural reservoir host of the novel coronavirus is probably a bat. The SARS coronavirus — which originated in southern China and killed 774 people worldwide in 2002-2003 — is also believed to have been carried by bats. A separate paper published Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology suggested that snakes are the “most probable wildlife animal reservoir” for the novel coronavirus — though some scientists have expressed doubts about the methodology and analysis that led the researchers to this conclusion. “To be honest, we don’t know that much about wildlife,” Lü said. “We’ve had domesticated poultry and livestock for thousands of years, yet there are still unknown viruses coming from these animals. Despite quarantine inspections for wildlife, there are many things we are unable to prevent.” Wild animals are often connected to disease outbreaks, including Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which are linked to bats and camels, respectively. The SARS coronavirus was detected in masked palm civets sold at a wet market in Guangdong province. The civets, which transmitted SARS to humans, are believed to have contracted the virus from bats. Just months ago, a man in Inner Mongolia became infected with pneumonic plague in November after skinning and eating a wild hare.As the novel coronavirus spreads, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and National Forestry and Grassland Administration have vowed to tighten restrictions over the country’s wildlife trade and suspend the trade of potential virus vectors, including bamboo rats and badgers. Several provincial-level administrative regions including Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, and Inner Mongolia have completely suspended all wildlife trade. Lü, meanwhile, is hoping the Chinese public will become more aware that consuming wildlife is “shameful” and “risky.” She’s also urging authorities to accept their responsibility to put an end to such practices. “If government departments do not cooperate, our concern is useless. We cannot police it ourselves,” Lü said. “In fact, we have tried a lot of methods but ended up with nothing (to show for it) because of a lack of scrutiny and law enforcement. I hope this big disaster will attract sufficient attention and lead to more impactful results.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005138
Tribute to Medical Staff Steals the Show at Spring Festival Gala,"Performances for the world’s most-watched television event are usually planned months in advance, but the most memorable one this year was a last-minute addition in light of the ongoing public health crisis.",2020-01-25,"A recitation paying tribute to medical staff battling a deadly novel coronavirus outbreak became the most talked-about performance of Friday’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s biggest television event aired annually on Lunar New Year’s Eve by state broadcaster CCTV. About an hour into the gala, six well-known Chinese TV hosts took the stage and performed a five-minute recitation called “Love Is the Bridge,” with each giving a moving tribute to the frontline medical workers working to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Unlike the other performances, which are planned and practiced months in advance, the recitation was a last-minute addition on Friday afternoon and was performed without being rehearsed beforehand. “We are here celebrating the new year while you are there helping to carry us through these difficulties,” TV host Bai Yansong said, addressing the medical workers. “We love you not only today, but every day of our lives.” “I want to give a new year’s greeting to the people of Wuhan. Staying home is your greatest contribution and sacrifice in fighting this epidemic,” said another host. “I want to give new year’s greetings to those who’ve left Wuhan in the past two weeks. Wherever you go, please take care of yourself and reduce the possibility of infecting others. Once you are safe, 1.4 billion of us will be safe.” By Saturday morning, the novel coronavirus originating in the central city of Wuhan had killed 41 people and infected at least 1,200 others on the Chinese mainland. CCTV’s annual gala, also known as chunwan, gradually rings in the new year over the course of a more than four-hour broadcast. First aired in 1983, it is now the most-watched television program on the planet, drawing a whopping 1.17 billion viewers last year. As usual, this year’s gala — officially titled “Fulfilling the Common Prosperity, Celebrating the Happy Year” — featured singing, dancing, opera, magic, comedy, and martial arts. But because of the coronavirus epidemic, two performance venues in the central city of Zhengzhou and the southern Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao contributed prerecorded rather than live performances. By Saturday afternoon, a hashtag translating to “the only chunwan performance that wasn’t rehearsed” had been viewed over 400 million times on microblogging platform Weibo. Many users said they hoped the tribute would sway anyone who wasn’t already taking the coronavirus epidemic seriously. “My mother finally agreed to wear a face mask after watching this performance,” one Weibo user commented. “I hope Grandpa will cancel the new year’s reunion for 30 people at his place,” posted another.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005139
Shanghai Launches Level 1 Emergency Response Over Coronavirus,The city is taking maximum emergency measures to prevent the spread of the deadly pneumonia-like virus as epidemic concerns grow.,2020-01-24,"With the Lunar New Year holiday already on China’s doorstep, Shanghai has launched its highest-level emergency response against the novel coronavirus that had infected 20 people in the city and at least 865 in the country as of noon Friday, according to official notices. Beijing had issued its own Level 1 emergency response just 15 minutes earlier. Shanghai’s public spaces — including subway stations, city buses, airports, train stations, and temples — have been carrying out daily disinfection measures since Wednesday, and staff at such locations have been ordered to wear face masks. Mandatory temperature screenings have been introduced at local hospitals, highway toll stations, and tourist sites. Local nursing homes have been encouraged to establish reporting mechanisms for possible cases, as the estimated average age of the infected individuals is 50 years old, according to research by Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper. The Shanghai Disney Resort has closed indefinitely. Schools have been barred from hosting events that might draw large crowds. And Shanghai authorities are calling for tighter controls over wildlife-related businesses, including banning the sale of wild animals and shutting down companies that provide close encounters with wildlife.  Face Masks and Protective Supplies Face masks are now ubiquitous among workers at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, two of the city’s largest transport hubs. When asked when they had decided to wear masks, several passengers told Sixth Tone that they began doing so around Monday, amid news reports of the virus spreading outside Wuhan, the site of the first infections. A security employee working in the Hongqiao Airport arrivals hall told Sixth Tone on Wednesday that, though staff were previously discouraged from wearing masks because “it doesn’t look good,” the facial accessories are now compulsory, and in most cases freely provided by state-affiliated transport authorities. Hongqiao Airport reportedly began conducting temperature screenings of passengers arriving from Wuhan on Wednesday. However, no mandatory screening could be observed at either the airport or the train station, with rail passengers arriving from Wuhan on Wednesday afternoon telling Sixth Tone they were not subjected to health screenings. As the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, Wuhan has been under lockdown since Thursday morning. Many residents were reportedly scrambling to leave the city before the 10 a.m. deadline. A Wuhan resident told Sixth Tone that she has remained in the city with her family but is worried about the precarious situation, especially since her father works at a train station. “Even though I was (initially) supportive of the action taken, when I actually saw that the city had been sealed off, I nearly broke down,” the woman wrote on microblogging platform Weibo. “I believe the decision-makers are thinking cautiously,” she told Sixth Tone later.  One of the last trains from Wuhan to Shanghai arrived at Hongqiao Railway Station Thursday afternoon. A passenger surnamed Gu told Sixth Tone that when he got on the high-speed train midway through the journey, in the eastern provincial capital of Hefei, he found an almost entirely empty carriage, with no one from Wuhan appearing to be onboard. The man said that at no point was his temperature checked. With a sharp rise in confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, concerns are growing among Shanghai residents. By noon Friday, the city had reported 20 patients, compared with 26 in Beijing. A 45-year-old Shanghai resident surnamed Chen told Sixth Tone that her family has cancelled their planned trip over the Spring Festival holiday because of the coronavirus outbreak. “We wanted to buy the (best) face masks … but they are basically out of stock now,” said Chen, who was wearing two disposable surgical masks, one over the other. While mask-making factories are working overtime and paying higher wages to stop supplies from running dry, many pharmacies in Shanghai have sold out of even basic disposable masks, leaving some people with little or no protection. Zheng, an Anhui native who works as a baggage porter at Hongqiao Railway Station, is among those in the city who have failed to obtain protective masks. “Sure, I’m worried. This is a matter of life and death,” Zheng said. “But what’s the use in worrying? I’m going back to Anhui in a few days and will definitely get masks there.” Patients and Hospitals While around 110 fever clinics in Shanghai have received patients seeking help, the vast majority of the confirmed coronavirus cases have reportedly been transferred to the Fudan University-affiliated Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in the city’s suburban Jinshan District. Shanghai has designated the Jinshan hospital as the city’s quarantine site for all confirmed patients and their close contacts, as well as any “highly suspected” cases, according to Caixin. The hospital has staff on duty 24 hours a day, and each patient is allotted their own room, with couples receiving double rooms, a patient at the facility surnamed Liu told the outlet.  Liu, a 52-year-old Wuhan resident who came to Shanghai to visit her daughter over Spring Festival, made headlines this week after unconfirmed online posts framed her as a high-level Wuhan health official who had fled from a Shanghai hospital after showing symptoms of infection gone into hiding. Wuhan’s health commission on Wednesday debunked this rumor, which had assumed the woman was Liu Qingxiang, the commission’s vice director. According to Caixin, Liu was identified as a suspected case Tuesday, a day after she sought medical attention for a high temperature. When Ruijin Hospital in central Shanghai was unable to contact Liu the morning after examining her, they requested assistance from the police, who located Liu in a residential compound that afternoon. Liu was taken back to the hospital for further checks, and the rooms and surfaces with which she came into contact were disinfected. Both Liu and her daughter have now been quarantined. When Sixth Tone visited Ruijin Hospital on Thursday, a few patients were quietly lined up at the fever clinic. Prominently placed signs requested that patients inform doctors if they had traveled to Wuhan within the past two weeks. Doctors in direct contact with patients were equipped with protective suits and eyewear. Gu Zhijian, a senior physician at Shanghai Tongren Hospital, told Sixth Tone’s sister publication The Paper that an increasing number of people — up to around 400 per day — have been coming in for fever checks. Those with ties to Wuhan are prioritized for treatment by the facility’s most experienced doctors in a separate room, Gu said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005135
Wuhan Residents Prepare To Step Solemnly Into the New Year,Citywide lockdowns amid the novel coronavirus epidemic have forced millions to change their plans and reconsider how they will welcome the Year of the Rat.,2020-01-24,"SHANGHAI — Wang Yuanyuan was supposed to be on a high-speed train to Wuhan for a big Lunar New Year’s Eve family dinner on Friday. But instead, she is more than 800 kilometers away in Shanghai, where she lives and works, scrolling through news feeds for the latest updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in her hometown, and missing out on the annual reunion to welcome the Year of the Rat. “I miss my parents and my 85-year-old grandma,” the 24-year-old told Sixth Tone on Thursday. “But if I go to Wuhan, I feel like I will expose myself to the virus, and I worry it might even affect my life when I return to Shanghai. People around me might see me as a walking virus.” More than 400 million Chinese people are expected to travel to their hometowns for the the Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival. For many migrant workers who endure long hours and endless shifts throughout the year, the weeklong annual holiday may be their only chance to see their families. Spring Festival is a time when elderly people are reunited with their children who’ve moved away to big cities for work, and in many cases the only time young couples see children they entrust to grandparents for a majority of the year. However, this year’s reunion for millions of people in Wuhan and surrounding cities in the central Hubei province has been characterized by fear and heartbreak, with over a dozen cities and counting turning into quarantine zones amid the coronavirus outbreak. Thirteen cities in Hubei including Wuhan are in partial or total lockdown mode, with air and ground transportation suspended since Thursday in a bid to contain the virus. As of noon Friday, there were around 550 confirmed coronavirus infections in Wuhan. Nationwide, 26 people have died and at least 870 people in nearly every provincial-level administrative region of China have been infected. Lin Xi, who works in Wuhan, said he heard about an “unidentified pneumonia” as early as mid-December, when such news first appeared on Chinese social media. The 30-year-old added that at first, he and those he knew didn’t take it seriously, and went about their daily lives in the city of 14 million people without the slightest concern. There were no signs of an epidemic in the initial weeks of the outbreak, Lin said. He got married this month and was looking forward to taking his bride to the southwestern Guizhou province to meet his family. The couple had booked their flights in November, shopped for new clothes, and even prepared a dozen hongbao — cash-stuffed red envelopes exchanged over Chinese holidays — for his parents and children in the family. But when Lin and his new bride heard about a mandatory mask policy and possible travel restrictions this week, they decided to cancel their plans and stay put. “At first, my parents still insisted that we come home for the reunion,” he told Sixth Tone. “But when they saw the news and realized how serious it was, even they told the other relatives back home to hold off on the family new year dinner.” On Monday, the National Health Commission confirmed that the new coronavirus was being transmitted from person to person and infecting medical workers, raising concerns that the mass migration over the holiday period might cause an epidemic. A leading scientist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended that people “not travel to Wuhan,” and that people in Wuhan “stay put if they can.” As the country welcomes the Lunar New Year and families gather for the customary feast, it will be a somber night for many in Wuhan, as well as those with close ties to the city. They may greet their loved ones over video calls instead of hugging them in person, and may have to rely on friends as stand-ins for family far away. “Of course it’s disappointing that we can’t go home,” Lin said. “But distance is not a problem as long as our hearts are together.” Wang, meanwhile, says she plans to spend Lunar New Year’s Eve with a colleague’s family in Shanghai. “I might cry when I video chat with my parents, because this is the first time in my life that I’m spending the new year without them,” she said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005137
"Hubei Residents Worry About Medical Supply, Test Kit Shortages",Family member of a pneumonia patient in Xiangyang says a lack of face masks and test kits to diagnose the novel coronavirus has the city on edge.,2020-01-24,"As China ramps up efforts to contain the spread of a deadly new coronavirus, some living just a few hundred kilometers from the epicenter of the outbreak say that a lack of test kits is making it difficult to diagnose new cases in their city. Yu Yang, who lives in Xiangyang, some 300 kilometers from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, told Sixth Tone that a shortage of proper medical equipment at local hospitals could hinder the containment of the virus, which had killed 26 people and infected 865 on the Chinese mainland as of noon Friday. Yu, who asked to be identified with a pseudonym, said he noticed the problem when he visited the city’s largest hospital with his wife after she showed symptoms of an infection. “It’s extremely worrying,” Yu said. “Dozens of patients were (in the hospital) with high fevers and kept coughing. Most of them had returned from Wuhan and were crowded in the doctor’s office.” “The doctor simply wore two masks, with no other protective gear. Most of the patients and their relatives weren’t even wearing masks. There are no quarantine measures for suspected cases.” By Wednesday night, Xiangyang had reported just 31 suspected cases of coronavirus infection, while Wuhan had reported 495 confirmed cases. When reached by Sixth Tone on Friday, staff at Xiangyang’s disease control and prevention office said it was “inconvenient” to disclose information about the availability of diagnostic kits. Yu and his wife returned to Xiangyang, their hometown, from Beijing on Monday and went straight to Xiangyang Central Hospital, as Yu’s wife had been feeling feverish the day before their journey. A routine blood test and CT scan showed that she had a viral infection, but Yu said the hospital couldn’t confirm whether it was the new coronavirus due to a lack of test kits. “There was no way to confirm if she was positive for the novel coronavirus,” Yu said. “She was told to go home and stay vigilant — if her condition worsened, she should be sent to the hospital immediately.” In an unprecedented move Thursday, eight cities in Hubei province including Wuhan were put on lockdown, with all public transport cut off in a bid to contain the virus. However, no such restrictions were imposed in Xiangyang. As a city of just over 6 million inhabitants, Xiangyang sees many of its young people migrate to its larger neighbor, Wuhan, for work. Yu said many of these young workers returned to their hometowns a week or two before the Lunar New Year holidays, and so he feared the number of infections could jump in the coming days. “In the room with IV drips, you could see people coughing everywhere — very few of them were wearing masks, many were spitting into trash bins, and others were eating right beside them,” the 37-year-old said. Yu is also concerned about the safety of hospital staff due to the shortage of face masks. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan who came into contact with coronavirus patients have been infected, with one in critical condition. To cope with the crisis, Hubei provincial authorities have sought help from the central government, requesting 40 million face masks, 5 million protective suits, and 5,000 infrared thermometers. Hubei will only be able to produce 8 million masks for medical purposes and 2 million protective suits by the end of January, provincial authorities said — a far cry from meeting the needs of patients and staff as more are quarantined. Three Shanghai-based manufacturers of novel coronavirus test kits told domestic media that they’ve been operating around the clock to meet the increasing demand. However, one manufacturer said that some of their raw materials suppliers are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, posing further challenges for domestic containment efforts.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005136
"Wuhan on Lockdown As 17 Dead, 571 Infected With Coronavirus",All transportation including flights and high-speed trains has been temporarily suspended as authorities attempt to contain the outbreak.,2020-01-23,"Wuhan has been placed under lockdown. The central Chinese city of 14 million has suspended all air and ground transportation in a bid to contain the new coronavirus that has killed 17 people and infected hundreds of others, according to an official announcement Thursday. From 10 a.m. Thursday, the city will no longer be operating its bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance transit services until further notice, the announcement said. The city will also close its airport and high-speed rail stations. “Residents should not leave Wuhan unless there’s a special reason,” the announcement said. The announcement comes just a day before the Lunar New Year’s Eve, the beginning of the country’s peak travel rush, when hundreds of millions of people travel home to be reunited with their families. With some 3 billion trips expected to be made over this year's holiday, there were concerns of the disease spreading further. On Wednesday, Wuhan’s health commission announced that the death toll from the coronavirus had nearly doubled since the day before. At least 17 people had died by Wednesday — all in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located — and the number of infections had spiked to 571 on the Chinese mainland, with cases in dozens of provinces, including major cities. All of the deceased were between 48 and 89 years old. Fifteen were over 60, and most had underlying health issues. Experts have suggested that children and young people are less susceptible to the virus. On Tuesday, Wuhan officials introduced a mandatory mask policy at local restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, shopping malls, and parks, among other places. Those without masks are being barred from public premises, and violators should be reported to the relevant authorities. Hong Kong’s top health official said Wednesday that a man who had traveled from Wuhan underwent a “preliminary positive test” for the virus. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macao, and the United States have also reported one infection each. On Wednesday, Thailand confirmed another infection in the country, a 73-year-old Thai woman, in addition to three Chinese tourists, according to local media. The woman had previously traveled to Wuhan.The World Health Organization held an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss the novel coronavirus but stopped short of declaring it a public health emergency. The global health body said it would meet again Thursday, given the evolving situation, especially in China. “The decision is one I take extremely seriously and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said during the press conference, referring to whether to declare a public health emergency. Health authorities in Wuhan first acknowledged the unexplained illness in over two dozen people on Dec. 31., but the first coronavirus cases weren’t reported in other Chinese cities until weeks later. A 61-year-old man in the city with preexisting medical conditions died on Jan. 9, becoming the virus’ first casualty. Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist who helped expose the scale and severity of the SARS outbreak in 2003, confirmed Monday that some of the newly identified novel coronavirus cases in the country are not linked to Wuhan. “It is no longer an accidental and scattered disease, and it is more than animal-to-human (transmission),” Zhong said at a press conference in the Chinese capital attended by a group of experts from the National Health Commission. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases unit, said during Wednesday’s press conference that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission in close settings, such as between family members or at medical facilities. “We have not seen any evidence of onward transmission such as 3rd, 4th generation transmission,” she said. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during Wednesday’s press conference that the novel coronavirus is believed to have come from wild animals that were illegally sold at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. According to a paper published Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology, the Wuhan coronavirus may have come from snakes. A team of five Chinese researchers concluded that snakes are the “most probable wildlife animal reservoir” based on an analysis of the novel coronavirus’ genetic properties. However, some of their peers in the Chinese scientific community have dismissed the paper as flawed, with one immunologist saying the researchers’ conclusion “is only based on a simple bioinformatics analysis” that doesn’t prove anything.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005131
"Fourth Coronavirus Death Confirmed, Human Transmission ‘Definite’","Over 200 people in at least four provincial-level regions have been infected, Chinese authorities say.",2020-01-21,"Hours before health authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan reported a fourth death Tuesday from the novel coronavirus that has the country on edge, the head of the team tasked with managing the outbreak said there is “definitely human-to-human transmission.” Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist who helped expose the scale and severity of the SARS outbreak in 2003, confirmed Monday that some of the newly identified novel coronavirus cases in the country are not linked to Wuhan, where the virus originated. So far, official reports say four people have died and a total of 219 have been infected, including 198 in Wuhan, 14 in Guangdong, five in Beijing, and two in Shanghai. “It is no longer an accidental and scattered disease, and it is more than animal-to-human (transmission),” Zhong said at a press conference in the Chinese capital attended by a group of experts from the National Health Commission. The scientist said two patients in Guangdong with no history of traveling to Wuhan contracted the virus from family members who had visited the city. On Tuesday, a commentary published by the social media account of China’s authoritative Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission urged officials to learn from the painful lessons of SARS and warned that anyone caught covering up infections would be “nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.” With the number of infections in Guangdong rising to 14 after a new case was reported Monday, the southern province has the most cases of any region in the country outside of Wuhan. Infections have been confirmed in four Guangdong cities — Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhanjiang, and Huizhou — according to the provincial health commission. Wuhan’s health commission on Tuesday confirmed that 15 medical staff in the city have been infected, along with one additional suspected case. Of these 16, who are all under quarantine, one person is said to be in “very serious” condition, while the others are stable. Wuhan’s health commission told CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, that the city has enforced access controls to curb the spread of the virus: Tour groups from other areas of China must remain in Wuhan for the time being, and local officials are checking private vehicles entering and leaving the city for wild animals and birds. There are several suspected cases hundreds of miles from Wuhan, too, in the eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Shandong, the southwestern Yunnan province, and the southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Zeng Guang, a scientist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the recent spike in the number of infections can be attributed to health authorities’ evolving knowledge of the virus. “Today’s understanding is different from yesterday’s,” he said at Monday’s press conference. Though Zeng says the uptick in cases isn’t altogether surprising, he suggests staying away from the epicenter over the Lunar New Year travel rush, when an estimated 3 billion trips are expected to be made as people cross the country to be reunited with their families. “We hope that people will not travel to Wuhan, and that people in Wuhan will stay put if they can,” Zeng said, adding that this view was not an “official call,” but rather a “suggestion” from the team of experts. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has not issued travel advisories or recommended trade restrictions in response to the outbreak. On Tuesday, the WHO said an emergency committee focused on the new virus will meet Wednesday at its headquarters in Geneva. Many online are urging rail and air travel providers and booking companies to offer refunds for already-purchased tickets, in the event that people end up changing their travel plans because of the coronavirus outbreak. One of China’s largest travel companies, Trip.com, said Tuesday that users would be allowed to cancel their bookings to Wuhan over the Lunar New Year without facing additional fees. The National Health Commission on Tuesday categorized the Wuhan coronavirus as a Class B infectious disease, the same category as its cousins, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory system (MERS). It added, however, that authorities would employ strategies devised for Class A pathogens — the most dangerous, most infectious disease category that includes cholera and plague — to stabilize the outbreak.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005113
China Confirms First Coronavirus Infections Outside Wuhan,"Three patients have tested positive for the virus in Beijing and Shenzhen, and 136 new cases — including a third death — were confirmed in Wuhan over the weekend.",2020-01-20,"Update: On Monday evening, the official Xinhua News Agency said that the total number of coronavirus infections in the country had climbed to 217, including 198 in Wuhan, 14 in Guangdong, and five in Beijing. Shortly after the update, the National Health Commission confirmed the first case in Shanghai. Two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, the cities’ health commissions said Monday. The announcements mark the first time the virus has been officially confirmed in mainland cities other than Wuhan since the outbreak began last month. According to the Shenzhen Health Commission, a 66-year-old man tested positive for the virus after traveling to Wuhan on Dec. 29 to visit his family. Before returning to Shenzhen on Jan. 4, he experienced fever and weakness. He was hospitalized a week after arriving in the southern city, and his biosample was sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, where it tested positive on Jan. 19 for the Wuhan coronavirus. Beijing’s health commission, meanwhile, confirmed two infections in the city’s southern Daxing District. Both patients had traveled to Wuhan and experienced fever-like symptoms. The three patients in Shenzhen and Beijing are reportedly in stable condition, and their close contacts are under medical observation. Also on Monday, the health commission in the eastern Zhejiang province announced five suspected cases of coronavirus infections in four cities: Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and Hangzhou, the provincial capital. The five patients — all of whom traveled to Wuhan and returned with flu-like symptoms — have been quarantined and are in stable condition, the commission said. As infections are starting to be diagnosed in other Chinese cities, Wuhan’s health commission publicly confirmed its third coronavirus-related death Monday, following two earlier deaths on Jan. 9 and Jan. 15. In a dramatic turn, Wuhan health authorities on Monday confirmed 136 new infections diagnosed over the weekend, bringing the total number of infections in the city to 198. Of these patients, three have died, 35 are in “serious condition,” nine are in “very serious condition,” 25 have recovered and been discharged, and 126 are hospitalized with mild symptoms. All of the 136 new cases — 66 men and 70 women — experienced symptoms before Jan. 18. The patients range in age from 25 to 89 years old. China’s National Health Commission said Sunday that it has established a national reporting mechanism for coronavirus infections, and that public updates will be published every day, even if there are no new developments. Infections in other Asian countries also appear to be on the rise. South Korea confirmed its first Wuhan coronavirus case Monday morning, becoming the third country in which the disease has been found, following two cases in Thailand and one in Japan. The South China Morning Post reported Saturday that a suspected case has been detected in Shanghai, citing sources familiar with the matter. The city’s mayor, Ying Yong, said in a press conference Monday morning that local authorities are dealing with suspected infections and will provide up-to-date information in the event of confirmed cases.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005104
17 More Coronavirus Infections Reported in Wuhan,A growing number of cases suggests China’s disease control authorities may have their work cut out for them over the Spring Festival travel period.,2020-01-19,"Wuhan health authorities said Sunday morning that 17 more pneumonia-like infections have been confirmed in the central Chinese city, far more than the four new infections disclosed in a previous official update. Before Thursday, the number of reported novel coronavirus cases in the city had remained at 41 for nearly two weeks, ever since health authorities acknowledged the mysterious illness for the first time on Dec. 31. As of Friday, however, that number had risen to 62 — with 19 patients fully recovered, eight in critical condition, two dead, and the rest hospitalized but in stable condition. In an interview with Hong Kong-based newspaper Takungpao, Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, said the maximum incubation period for a coronavirus is 15 days. “No new cases have been reported since Jan. 3, which shows that the outbreak has been brought under control,” Guan was quoted as saying on Wednesday. In the following two days, 21 new cases were reported. In a daily news release Saturday, the Wuhan Health Commission said that close contacts of three confirmed novel coronavirus patients — two in Thailand and one in Japan — are under medical observation. “Only one close contact of the first confirmed patient in Thailand revealed symptoms of mild fever and coughing. No other abnormalities have been observed so far,” the statement said. On Friday, scholars in the U.K. published a report estimating that there may have been over 1,700 people showing symptoms of coronavirus infection in Wuhan alone as of Jan 12. The researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London explained that their estimate was based on several assumptions including 3,301 air passengers traveling internationally from Wuhan each day, as well as a 10-day delay between infection and detection. However, some Chinese experts have questioned the methodology behind such a high estimate. “They (the ICL researchers) used a model for common infectious diseases to reach their conclusion, but the transmission method of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan remains unclear,” Wang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at the Peking University Health Science Center, told Sixth Tone on Sunday. Last week, Wuhan’s health authorities acknowledged that the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out for the new coronavirus, though the risk of such transmission being sustained over time should be low. The South China Morning Post reported Saturday that three suspected cases have been detected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, citing sources familiar with the matter. Health authorities in Shenzhen declined to comment for the report and had not issued an official statement by time of publication. On Sunday evening, Shanghai’s health authority responded to public concerns, saying the city is taking preventive measures against the virus. “All medical facilities have allocated more staff to their fever departments. Standardized monitoring, screening, diagnosis, and treatment will be carried out for suspected cases,” the statement said. As to why there have not been confirmed reports of coronavirus infections in other mainland cities besides Wuhan, Professor Wang says this is likely because tests for the virus aren’t yet widely available. With less than a week to go before the Spring Festival holiday officially begins, China has already entered the year’s peak travel period, chunyun, sometimes described as the world’s largest human migration. This year, state authorities estimate that 3 billion trips will be made over the 40-day period beginning Jan. 10. Wuhan authorities said Sunday that they have enforced new measures aimed at preventing the virus from spreading, including installing infrared thermometers at the city’s international airport, train stations, and long-distance bus terminals; cancelling nonessential large public events over the Spring Festival period; and strictly managing fever departments at local medical institutions. The World Health Organization has advised people in affected areas to avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection; to wash hands frequently, especially after direct contact with sick people or their surroundings; and to stay away from live or dead animals other than household pets. Professor Wang suggests that more publicity work should be carried out to alert people about the new virus. “The public should be able to get some basic understanding of the virus and the prevention methods,” he said. “Better ventilation and sterilization work should be carried out in public places like train stations, and inspection and quarantine work should be carried out in key high-risk areas.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005097
China Confirms Second Death From Novel Coronavirus,"City authorities say 12 of the 41 infected have been discharged from hospitals, with additional infections reported in Thailand, Japan, and possibly Nepal.",2020-01-17,"A 69-year-old man with underlying medical conditions has become the second casualty of a novel coronavirus that has infected dozens of people in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, according to local health officials. The city’s health commission said Thursday that the patient, who died early Wednesday morning, was also suffering from heart, kidney, and lung conditions. Another patient, a 61-year-old man who had “serious underlying medical conditions,” had died on Jan. 9. A total of 41 people in Wuhan have reportedly been infected with the novel coronavirus — the same virus family that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both of which were ruled out for the recent cases — that is believed to have originated in the city’s South China Seafood Wholesale Market. However, health officials said they have also discovered a few cases among individuals who did not visit the market. “Existing survey results show that clear human-to-human evidence has not been found, and the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out — though the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low,” Wuhan’s health commission said Wednesday. On Thursday, the health authority said 12 of the 41 infected had recovered and been discharged from hospital. Another five people are in critical condition, while more than 100 close contacts of those infected are under medical observation, with none reporting symptoms so far. Meanwhile, health authorities in Nepal said Friday that a man who was quarantined on suspicion of being infected has been discharged, according to the Kathmandu Post. The 31-year-old Nepali national had flown in from Wuhan and was hospitalized for respiratory problems on Jan. 13. Doctors in Kathmandu told the Post that the man’s lab results were pending due to a lack of testing kits, and that the hospital is sending the samples abroad for confirmation. In Thailand, a 74-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan on Monday became the second person in the country to test positive for the coronavirus, Thai health authorities said Friday. A 61-year-old Chinese woman had become the first imported case of a novel coronavirus infection earlier this week. Both women are in stable condition, according to Thai health officials. Japan also confirmed its first case involving the new coronavirus Thursday, the World Health Organization said, citing Japan’s health ministry. The patient, a Chinese national in his 30s who had traveled to Wuhan, was hospitalized Jan. 10 before being discharged Wednesday after making a full recovery, according to local media reports. The WHO and Wuhan health authorities said this week that the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission “cannot be ruled out.” The infected patients in Japan and Thailand have said that they had no history of visiting the South China Seafood Market. “Considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries are likely,” the WHO said.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005089
Human Transmission of Wuhan Pneumonia ‘Cannot Be Ruled Out’,The city’s health authority said some patients infected by the new coronavirus had not visited the market believed to be the source of the outbreak.,2020-01-15,"More than a month after dozens of mysterious pneumonia cases were first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, local health officials have acknowledged the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission. “Existing survey results show that clear human-to-human evidence has not been found and the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out — though the risk of continued human-to-human transmission is low,” Wuhan’s health commission said Wednesday. Some of the 41 people who have been infected with the novel coronavirus — the same virus family that causes SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, both of which were ruled out for the recent cases — apparently did not visit the city’s South China Seafood Wholesale Market, to which the infections were traced, according to the statement. The wife of a male patient who worked at the market is among those who contracted the virus without visiting the area. “It is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families,” Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases unit, told Reuters on Tuesday. “But it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.” On Monday, a 61-year-old Chinese woman who had traveled to Thailand from Wuhan became the first imported case of the novel coronavirus, the World Health Organization said, citing Thai health authorities. The woman — who exhibited symptoms including fever and sore throat — was intercepted at Bangkok’s international airport on Jan. 8 and hospitalized soon after. The woman had no history of visiting the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, although she frequented another wet market before developing a fever on Jan. 5, according to the WHO. In Wednesday’s statement, the Wuhan Health Commission said that the woman is in stable condition at a Thai hospital, adding that none of her travel companions have reported similar symptoms. Hu Bijie, deputy director of the Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Shanghai, told financial news outlet Caixin that “theoretically speaking, most respiratory viruses are transmissible between humans, with the only difference being to what degree.” On Tuesday, the Wuhan Health Commission reiterated that all 41 cases in the city were identified before Jan. 3, with none reported since. Seven of these individuals have been discharged from hospitals, six remain in critical condition, and none of the more than 700 close contacts of the infected have reported any symptoms. A 61-year-old man with “serious underlying medical conditions” has been the outbreak’s only casualty so far. The patient, who died on Jan. 9, often shopped at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market. “Older patients with underlying diseases are more likely to be in critical condition,” the city’s health authority said. In an article in the China Medical Tribune, a state-run publication for health-related news, Lu Hongzhou, deputy director of the Fudan University-affiliated Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, said there are currently no medicines for effectively treating the new coronavirus. The best course of action, he added, is to try and mitigate damage to the lungs and other organs.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005079
First Death Reported From Wuhan Pneumonia Cases,"No new cases have been detected since Jan. 3, and the WHO says it is “reassured” by Chinese health authorities’ investigations and response efforts.",2020-01-13,"A patient with “serious underlying medical conditions” has died from the newly discovered coronavirus responsible for dozens of pneumonia cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the World Health Organization said Sunday. The notice was otherwise largely positive, with the WHO saying it is “reassured of the quality of the ongoing investigations and the response measures implemented in Wuhan, and the commitment to share information regularly.” The WHO reiterated that there has been “no clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission and said no cases of infection with the novel coronavirus — the same virus family that causes SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, both of which were ruled out for the recent cases — have been reported in Wuhan or any other city since Jan. 3. On Saturday, the Wuhan Health Commission revealed that a 61-year-old man had become the first casualty of the mysterious pneumonia that was first detected last month. The patient — who was reportedly also dealing with other serious health conditions — died on Jan. 9 due to respiratory and circulatory failure. Another seven people are in critical condition, according to the city’s health authorities, while six have recovered and been discharged from hospital. Symptoms in the 41 confirmed cases occurred between Dec. 8 and Jan. 2, the WHO said. Wuhan authorities said the deceased often shopped at the city’s wholesale fish and live animal market, believed to be the source of the infections. The WHO said the evidence is “highly suggestive” that the outbreak is associated with this location, given that most of the 41 cases worked at or were frequent visitors to the market. Chinese authorities have said they plan to increase monitoring and disinfection measures ahead of the upcoming of Spring Festival travel rush, when hundreds of millions of people across the country will travel to their hometowns to be reunited with family.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005068
"New Coronavirus Responsible for Wuhan Pneumonia, CCTV Says","A team of public health experts made the preliminary determination after sequencing the virus’ entire genome, according to China’s state broadcaster.",2020-01-09,"A new type of coronavirus is believed to be the cause of a mysterious pneumonia that has infected dozens of people in both the central Chinese city of Wuhan and Hong Kong, state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday, citing the results of a preliminary investigation by a team of experts from the National Health Commission. The Hubei Provincial Health Commission appeared to endorse this finding by sharing CCTV’s report on its official account on social app WeChat — though a staff member at the commission who answered Sixth Tone’s phone call Thursday would not comment on the nature of the virus. Xu Jianguo, the director of China’s National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of the team of experts, told Xinhua News Agency that his team had sequenced the virus’ entire genome on Tuesday. “A total of 15 positive results for a new coronavirus were obtained from patients,” he added. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are six known coronaviruses that infect humans. Four produce relatively minor flu-like symptoms, while two — the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory system (MERS) — are more serious. Wuhan health authorities on Sunday ruled out the possibility that SARS and MERS were responsible for city’s infections. Though coronaviruses typically infect mammals — including bats, livestock, and household pets — they can also infect humans, and may spread from sick to healthy people through the air (coughing and sneezing), close physical contact, or when fingers touch a contaminated surface and then the mouth, nose, or eyes, according to the U.S. CDC. Chinese authorities, however, say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the Wuhan cases. The World Health Organization has confirmed that a new coronavirus may be responsible for the outbreak cluster in Wuhan, according to multiple media reports Thursday. “For the next step, we will need to conduct further research and examinations based on etiological research, epidemiological investigation, and clinical symptoms,” Xu said. Since the first symptoms of the mysterious illness were observed on Dec. 12, over 50 people in Wuhan have been infected — eight of whom recovered and were discharged from local hospitals Wednesday, according to CCTV. Beyond the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has reported 38 pneumonia-like infections in people who recently traveled to Wuhan, as well as one case each in Singapore and South Korea, though the former was later dismissed as unrelated to the Wuhan cluster. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not published any updates since Jan. 5, unnerving Hong Kong’s health authorities as they grapple with the city’s own mystery infections. Despite dozens of cases in Hong Kong, not a single unexplained illness has been reported in another mainland city in recent weeks. “This Wuhan disease is so weird — it only seems to affect Hong Kong people,” quipped one user on microblogging platform Weibo.",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005058
"Earliest Wuhan Pneumonia Symptoms Observed Dec. 12, Authorities Say",Fifty-nine people in the central Chinese city have been infected with an as-yet-unidentified pathogen — though SARS has been ruled out.,2020-01-06,"The number of people infected with a mysterious viral pneumonia in Wuhan has climbed to 59, with the first patient exhibiting symptoms as early as Dec. 12, the city’s health commission announced Sunday. Though the virus has not yet been identified, several causes — including SARS, as many in the country feared — have been ruled out. Seven of the infected individuals are in critical condition, down from 11 in the commission’s previous statement Friday. No deaths from the pneumonia have been reported. In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome — a disease that killed over 700 people in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Chinese mainland in 2002-2003 — several other viruses including bird flu, regular flu, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have also been eliminated as potential causes. Wuhan authorities first acknowledged over two dozen cases of the unexplained illness on Dec. 31. As of Sunday, 16 people had been hospitalized with pneumonia in Hong Kong after returning from Wuhan, according to the special administrative region’s Centre for Health Protection. The day before, Singapore’s health ministry said that a 3-year-old who had returned to the city-state after traveling to Wuhan had contracted respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of childhood pneumonia, and was quarantined but in stable condition. Meanwhile, China’s health officials and state-run media outlets have said little about the possibility of infections spreading to other cities on the mainland. However, according to Ma Jin, director of the School of Public Health at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, this should be seen as an encouraging sign. “China’s epidemic prevention system works like this: Once a hospital receives a suspected case, it will report to the health commissions immediately — so if there are any more infections in other cities, the public should know about it,” Ma told Sixth Tone. The Wuhan Health Commission’s most recent statement includes a seven-point action plan for dealing with the outbreak. It says that 163 people who came into close contact with the infected individuals had been put under medical observation, and that the South China Seafood Wholesale Market — where the first infections are believed to have occurred — had been shut down for “further hygiene investigations.” The health authority added that it is still trying to identify the pathogen and determine the exact origin of the infections. Amid online backlash over the Wuhan government’s initial response to the infection, which some felt was slow and inadequate, local police announced the next day that eight people from the city had been taken into custody for “spreading rumors” about the disease that many online feared might be SARS. In a statement Monday, the World Health Organization said Wuhan authorities had been providing information about the outbreak to the WHO’s China office since Dec. 31. “The symptoms reported among the patients are common to several respiratory diseases, and pneumonia is common in the winter season,” the WHO said. “However, the occurrence of 44 cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization clustered in space and time should be handled prudently.” The WHO suggested that there could be an “exposure link to animals,” given that several of the initial infections occurred in vendors at the seafood market, which also sells poultry and meat. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy in Minnesota, told the U.S. health news website Stat that the virus likely comes from birds or animals and not seafood. With the first day of the Spring Festival holiday — during which around 400 million Chinese people travel to their hometowns to be with family — just weeks away, there is some concern that the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan may become a national rather than a local problem. But Director Ma says it’s possible to improve one’s chances of staying safe, too. “Spring Festival will increase the possibility of infection for sure,” he said. “However, there are ways for people to prevent it — for example, by washing hands often and avoiding sharing food with others.”",https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005041
